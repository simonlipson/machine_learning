## AFL Brownlow Medal Predictor
Australian Rules Football is a fantastic game to watch and a brilliant sport to predict. Each year, one player is awarded the Brownlow Medal (the MVP of the season). After each game, the on-field referees decide which player should receive one-vote, two-votes and three-votes. At the end of the season, all of those votes are tallied and the player with the most wins the medal. 
This of course draws a lot of betting and speculation to determine who will win the medal. And thus, the problem: 
**Can an algorithm help predict the winner of the Brownlow Medal?**
To help me do so I attained data from the 2003-2019 AFL seasons and trained a model to predict the amount of votes each player will receive in each of those seasons. The player that was predicted to have the highest amount of votes should theoretically be the winner of the medal.
