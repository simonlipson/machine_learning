0,Monica," There's nothing to tell! He's just some guy
I work with!"
1,Joey," C'mon, you're going out with the guy! There's
gotta be something wrong with him!"
2,Chandler," All right Joey, be
nice.  So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece?"
3,Phoebe," Wait, does he eat chalk?"
5,Phoebe," Just, 'cause, I don't want her to go through
what I went through with Carl- oh!"
6,Monica," Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a
date. It's just two people going out to dinner and- not having sex."
7,Chandler, Sounds like a date to me.
9,Chandler," Alright, so I'm back in high school, I'm
standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realize I am totally naked."
11,Chandler," Then I look down, and I realize there's a
phone... there."
12,Joey, Instead of...?
13,Chandler, That's right.
14,Joey, Never had that dream.
15,Phoebe, No.
16,Chandler," All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring.
Now I don't know what to do, everybody starts looking at me. "
17,Monica," And they weren't looking at
you before?!"
18,Chandler," Finally, I figure
I'd better answer it, and it turns out it's my mother,
which is very-very weird, because- she never calls me!"
20,Ross, (mortified) Hi.
21,Joey," This guy says hello, I wanna kill myself."
22,Monica," Are you okay, sweetie?"
23,Ross," I just feel like someone reached down my
throat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my
neck..."
24,Chandler, Cookie?
25,Monica," (explaining to the others) Carol moved her
stuff out today. "
26,Joey, Ohh.
27,Monica, (to Ross) Let me get you some coffee.
28,Ross, Thanks.
29,Phoebe," Ooh! Oh! (She starts to pluck at the air
just in front of Ross.)"
30,Ross," No, no don't! Stop cleansing my aura! No, just
leave my aura alone, okay?"
31,Phoebe, Fine!  Be murky!
32,Ross," I'll be fine,
alright? Really, everyone. I hope she'll be very happy."
33,Monica, No you don't.
34,Ross," No I don't, to hell with her, she left me!"
35,Joey, And you never knew she was a lesbian...
36,Ross," No!! Okay?! Why does everyone keep fixating on
that? She didn't know, how should I know?"
37,Chandler," Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian... (They
all stare at him.) Did I say that out loud?"
38,Ross," I told mom and dad last night,
they seemed to take it pretty well."
39,Monica," Oh really, so that
hysterical phone call I got from a woman at sobbing 300 A.M., ""I'll never have
grandchildren, I'll never have grandchildren."" was what?  A wrong number?"
40,Ross, Sorry.
41,Joey," Alright Ross, look. You're feeling a lot of
pain right now. You're angry. You're hurting. Can I tell you what the answer is?"
43,Joey," Strip joint! C'mon, you're single! Have some
hormones!"
44,Ross," I don't want to be single, okay? I just... I
just- I just wanna be married again!"
46,Chandler," And I just want a million dollars! (He
extends his hand hopefully.)"
47,Monica, Rachel?!
48,Rachel," Oh God Monica hi! Thank God! I just went to
your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be
here and you are, you are!"
50,Monica," (pointing at Rachel) De-caff. (to All) Okay,
everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor. (to Rachel) This is everybody,
this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross? "
51,Rachel," Hi, sure!"
52,Ross, Hi. 
54,Monica," So you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting
for four wet bridesmaids?"
55,Rachel," Oh God... well, it started about a half hour
before the wedding. I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was
looking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden-
(to the waitress that brought her coffee)Sweet 'n' Lo?- I realized that I was more turned
on by this gravy boat than by Barry! And then I got really freaked out, and that's when it
hit me how much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head. Y'know, I mean, I always knew looked
familiar, but... Anyway, I just had to get out of there, and I started wondering 'Why am I
doing this, and who am I doing this for?'. (to Monica) So anyway I just didn't know where
to go, and I know that you and I have kinda drifted apart, but you're the only person I
knew who lived here in the city."
56,Monica, Who wasn't invited to the wedding.
57,Rachel," Ooh, I was kinda hoping that wouldn't be an
issue... [Scene Monica's Apartment, everyone is there and watching a Spanish Soap on TV
and are trying to figure out what is going on.]"
58,Monica," Now I'm guessing that he bought her the big
pipe organ, and she's really not happy about it. "
59,Chandler," (imitating the characters)
Tuna or egg salad?  Decide!"
60,Ross," (in a deep voice) I'll have
whatever Christine is having."
61,Rachel," (on phone) Daddy, I just... I can't marry
him! I'm sorry. I just don't love him. Well, it matters to me! "
63,Phoebe,"  If I let go of
my hair, my head will fall off. "
64,Chandler," (re TV) Ooh, she should not be wearing
those pants. "
65,Joey, I say push her down the stairs. 
68,Rachel," C'mon Daddy, listen to me! It's like, it's
like, all of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe! You're a shoe, you're a
shoe, you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a
shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I'm not saying I want you
to buy me a hat, I'm saying I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy!"
69,Ross, You can see where he'd have trouble.
70,Rachel," Look Daddy, it's my life. Well maybe I'll
just stay here with Monica. "
71,Monica," Well, I guess we've established who's
staying here with Monica..."
72,Rachel," Well, maybe that's my decision. Well, maybe
I don't need your money. Wait!! Wait, I said maybe!!"
74,Monica," Just breathe, breathe.. that's it. Just try
to think of nice calm things..."
75,Phoebe," (sings) Raindrops on roses and rabbits and
kittens, (Rachel and Monica turn to look at her.) bluebells and sleighbells and- something
with mittens... La la la la...something and noodles with
string.  These are a few..."
76,Rachel, I'm all better now.
77,Phoebe," (grins and walks to the kitchen and says to
Chandler and Joey.) I helped!"
78,Monica," Okay, look, this is probably for the best,
y'know? Independence. Taking control of your life.  The whole,
'hat' thing."
79,Joey," (comforting her) And hey, you need anything,
you can always come to Joey. Me and Chandler live across the hall. And he's away a lot."
80,Monica," Joey, stop hitting on her! It's her wedding
day!"
81,Joey," What, like there's a rule or something?"
83,Chandler," Please don't do that again, it's a
horrible sound."
85,Monica," Oh God, is it
630?  Buzz him in!"
86,Joey, Who's Paul?
87,Ross," Paul the Wine Guy, Paul?"
88,Monica," Maybe. Joey Wait. Your 'not a real
date' tonight is with Paul the Wine Guy?"
89,Ross, He finally asked you out?
90,Monica, Yes!
91,Chandler," Ooh, this is a Dear Diary moment."
92,Monica," Rach, wait, I can cancel..."
93,Rachel," Please, no, go, that'd be fine!"
94,Monica," (to Ross) Are, are you okay? I mean, do you
want me to stay?"
95,Ross, (choked voice) That'd be good...
96,Monica, (horrified) Really?
97,Ross," (normal voice) No, go on! It's Paul the Wine
Guy!"
98,Phoebe," What does that mean?  
Does he sell it, drink it, or just complain a lot? (Chandler doesn't know.)"
100,Monica," Hi, come in! Paul, this is.. (They are all
lined up next to the door.)... everybody, everybody, this is Paul."
102,Chandler," I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name. Paul,
was it?"
103,Monica," Okay, umm-umm, I'll
just--I'll be right back, I just gotta go ah, go ah..."
104,Ross, A wandering?
105,Monica," Change!  Okay,
sit down. (Shows Paul in) Two seconds."
106,Phoebe," Ooh, I just pulled out four eyelashes. That
can't be good."
108,Joey,"  Hey, Paul!"
110,Joey," Here's a little tip, she
really likes it when you rub her neck in the same spot over and over and over again until
it starts to get a little red."
111,Monica," (yelling from the bedroom)
Shut up, Joey!"
112,Ross," So Rachel, what're you, uh... what're you up
to tonight?"
113,Rachel," Well, I was kinda supposed to be headed for
Aruba on my honeymoon, so nothing!"
114,Ross," Right, you're not even getting your honeymoon,
God.. No, no, although, Aruba, this time of year... talk about your- (thinks) -big
lizards... Anyway, if you don't feel like being alone tonight, Joey and Chandler are
coming over to help me put together my new furniture."
115,Chandler," (deadpan) Yes, and we're very excited
about it. "
116,Rachel," Well actually thanks, but I think I'm just
gonna hang out here tonight.  It's been kinda a long day."
117,Ross," Okay, sure."
118,Joey," Hey Pheebs, you wanna help?"
119,Phoebe," Oh, I wish I could, but I don't want to."
122,Phoebe," (singing) Love is sweet as
summer showers, love is a wondrous work of art, but your love oh your love, your love...is
like a giant pigeon...crapping on my heart.  La-la-la-la-la- (some guy gives her some
change and to that guy) Thank you. (sings) La-la-la-la...ohhh!"
124,Ross," (squatting and reading the instructions) I'm
supposed to attach a brackety thing to the side things, using a bunch of these little worm
guys. I have no brackety thing, I see no whim guys whatsoever and- I cannot feel my legs."
126,Joey," I'm thinking we've got a
bookcase here."
127,Chandler, It's a beautiful thing.
128,Joey, (picking up a leftover part) What's this?
129,Chandler," I would have to
say that is an 'L'-shaped bracket."
130,Joey, Which goes where?
131,Chandler," I have no
idea."
133,Joey, Done with the bookcase!
134,Chandler, All finished!
135,Ross," (clutching a beer can and sniffing) This was
Carol's favorite beer. She always drank it out of the can, I should have known."
136,Joey," Hey-hey-hey-hey, if you're
gonna start with that stuff we're outta here."
137,Chandler," Yes, please don't spoil
all this fun."
138,Joey," Ross, let me ask you a question. She got the
furniture, the stereo, the good TV- what did you get?"
139,Ross, You guys.
140,Chandler," Oh, God."
141,Joey, You got screwed.
142,Chandler, Oh my God!
144,Monica, Oh my God!
146,Monica," My brother's going through that right now,
he's such a mess. How did you get through it?"
148,Monica, -leg?
150,Monica," You actually broke her watch?  Wow!  The worst thing I ever did was, I-I shredded by
boyfriend's favorite bath towel."
152,Monica," That's right.
[Scene Monica's Apartment, Rachel is talking on the phone and pacing.]"
153,Rachel," Barry, I'm sorry... I am so sorry... I know
you probably think that this is all about what I said the other day about you making love
with your socks on, but it isn't... it isn't, it's about me, and I ju- (She stops talking
and dials the phone.) Hi, machine cut me off again... anyway...look,
look, I know that some girl is going to be incredibly lucky to become Mrs. Barry Finkel,
but it isn't me, it's not me.  And not that I have any idea who me is right now, but
you just have to give me a chance too... (The maching cuts her off again and she redials.)"
155,Ross," I'm divorced!  I'm only
26 and I'm divorced!"
156,Joey, Shut up!
157,Chandler," You must stop! (Chandler
hits what he is working on with a hammer and it collapses.)"
158,Ross, That only took me an hour.
159,Chandler," Look, Ross, you gotta
understand, between us we haven't had a relationship that has lasted longer than a Mento.
  You, however have had the love of a woman for four years.  
Four years of closeness and sharing at the end of which she ripped your heart out, and
that is why we don't do it!  I don't think that was my point!"
160,Ross," You know what the scariest part is? What if
there's only one woman for everybody, y'know? I mean what if you get one woman- and that's
it? Unfortunately in my case, there was only one woman- for her..."
161,Joey," What are you talking about? 'One woman'?
That's like saying there's only one flavor of ice cream for you. Lemme tell you something,
Ross. There's lots of flavors out there. There's Rocky Road, and Cookie Dough, and Bing!
Cherry Vanilla. You could get 'em with Jimmies, or nuts, or whipped cream! This is the
best thing that ever happened to you! You got married, you were, like, what, eight?
Welcome back to the world! Grab a spoon!"
162,Ross, I honestly don't know if I'm hungry or horny.
163,Chandler," Stay out of my freezer! [Scene A
Restaurant, Monica and Paul are still eating.]"
165,Monica," What?..... What, you wanna spell it out with
noodles?"
167,Monica," Oh, so there is gonna be a fifth date?"
169,Monica," Yeah... yeah, I think there is. -What were
you gonna say?"
171,Monica," (spitting out her drink in shock) Oh God, oh
God, I am sorry... I am so sorry..."
173,Monica," I know being spit on is probably not what
you need right now. Um... how long?"
175,Monica," Wow! I'm-I'm-I'm glad you smashed her watch!
"
177,Monica," (pause)...Yeah. Yeah, I do."
180,Rachel," Oh...see... but Joanne loved Chachi! That's
the difference!"
182,Ross," (scornful) Grab a spoon. Do you know how long
it's been since I've grabbed a spoon? Do the words 'Billy, don't be a hero' mean anything
to you? "
183,Joey," Great story!  But, I uh,
I gotta go, I got a date with Andrea--Angela--Andrea...  Oh man, (looks to Chandler)"
184,Chandler," Angela's the screamer,
Andrea has cats."
185,Joey," Right.  Thanks. 
It's June.  I'm outta here. (Exits.)"
186,Ross," Y'know, here's the thing. Even if I could get
it together enough to- to ask a woman out,... who am I gonna ask? (He gazes out of the
window.)"
190,Rachel," Isn't this amazing? I mean, I have never
made coffee before in my entire life."
191,Chandler, That is amazing.
192,Joey, Congratulations. 
193,Rachel," Y'know, I figure if I can
make coffee, there isn't anything I can't do."
194,Chandler," If can invade Poland,
there isn't anything I can't do."
195,Joey," Listen, while you're on a roll, if you feel
like you gotta make like a Western omelet or something... (Joey and Chandler taste the
coffee, grimace, and pour it into a plant pot.) Although actually I'm really not that
hungry..."
196,Monica," (entering, to herself) Oh
good, Lenny and Squigy are here."
199,Joey," Morning, Paul."
200,Rachel," Hello, Paul."
201,Chandler," Hi, Paul, is it?"
204,Monica, Stop!
206,Monica, We'll talk later.
208,Joey," That wasn't a real date?! What the hell do you
do on a real date?"
209,Monica," Shut up, and put my table back."
211,Chandler," All right, kids, I gotta get to work. If I
don't input those numbers,... it doesn't make much of a difference... "
212,Rachel," So, like, you guys all have jobs?"
213,Monica," Yeah, we all have jobs. See, that's how we
buy stuff."
214,Joey," Yeah, I'm an actor."
215,Rachel, Wow! Would I have seen you in anything?
216,Joey, I doubt it. Mostly regional work.
217,Monica," Oh wait, wait, unless you happened to catch
the Reruns' production of Pinocchio, at the little theater in the
park."
218,Joey," Look, it was a job all right?"
219,Chandler," 'Look, Gippetto, I'm a real live boy.'"
220,Joey," I will not take this abuse. (Walks to the door
and opens it to leave.)"
221,Chandler," You're right, I'm sorry. (Burst into song
and dances out of the door.) ""Once I was a wooden boy, a little wooden boy..."""
222,Joey," You should both know,
that he's a dead man.  Oh, Chandler? (Starts after Chandler.) "
223,Monica," So how you doing today? Did you sleep okay?
Talk to Barry? I can't stop smiling."
224,Rachel," I can see that. You look like you slept with
a hanger in your mouth."
225,Monica," I know, he's just so, so... Do you remember
you and Tony DeMarco?"
226,Rachel," Oh, yeah."
227,Monica," Well, it's like that. With feelings."
228,Rachel, Oh wow. Are you in trouble.
229,Monica, Big time!
230,Rachel," Want a wedding dress?  
Hardly used."
231,Monica," I think we are getting
a little ahead of selves here. Okay. Okay. I am just going to get up, go to work
and not think about him all day. Or else I'm just gonna get up and go to work."
232,Rachel," Oh, look, wish me luck!"
233,Monica, What for?
234,Rachel," I'm gonna go get one of those (Thinks) job
things."
238,Monica," Hey Frannie, welcome back! How was Florida? "
240,Monica, How do you do that?
242,Monica, You know Paul? 
244,Monica, You mean you know Paul like I know Paul? 
247,Joey, (sitting on the arm of the couch)Of course it was a line! 
248,Monica," Why?! Why? Why, why would anybody do something like that? "
249,Ross," I assume we're looking for an answer more sophisticated than 'to get you
into bed'. "
250,Monica, I hate men!  I hate men!
251,Phoebe," Oh no, don't hate, you don't
want to put that out into the universe."
252,Monica," Is it me? Is it like I have some sort of
beacon that only dogs and men with severe emotional problems can hear? "
253,Phoebe," All right, c'mere, gimme your feet. (She starts massaging them.) "
254,Monica," I just thought he was nice, y'know? "
255,Joey," (bursts out laughing again) I can't believe you didn't know it was a line!
"
257,Rachel, Guess what? 
258,Ross, You got a job? 
259,Rachel," Are you kidding? I'm trained for nothing! I was laughed out of twelve
interviews today. "
260,Chandler, And yet you're surprisingly upbeat. 
261,Rachel," You would be too if you found John and David boots on sale, fifty
percent off! "
262,Chandler," Oh, how well you know me... "
263,Rachel," They're my new 'I don't need a job, I don't need my parents, I've got
great boots' boots! "
264,Monica, How'd you pay for them? 
265,Rachel," Uh, credit card. "
266,Monica, And who pays for that? 
267,Rachel, Um... my... father. 
269,Rachel," Oh God, come on you
guys, is this really necessary?  I mean, I can stop charging anytime I want. "
270,Monica," C'mon, you can't live off your parents your whole life. "
271,Rachel, I know that. That's why I was getting married. 
272,Phoebe," Give her a break, it's hard being on your own for the first time. "
273,Rachel, Thank you. 
274,Phoebe," You're welcome. I remember when I first came to this city. I was
fourteen. My mom had just killed herself and my step-dad was back in prison, and I got
here, and I didn't know anybody. And I ended up living with this albino guy who was, like,
cleaning windshields outside port authority, and then he killed himself, and then I found
aromatherapy. So believe me, I know exactly how you feel. "
276,Ross, The word you're looking for is 'Anyway'... 
277,Monica," All right, you ready?"
278,Rachel," No.  No, no, I'm not
ready!  How can I be ready?  ""Hey, Rach!  You ready to jump out the
airplane without your parachute?""  Come on, I can't do this!"
279,Monica," You can, I know you
can! "
280,Rachel, I don't think so.
281,Ross," Come on, you made
coffee!   You can do anything! (Chandler slowly tries to hide the now dead plant from
that morning when he and Joey poured their coffee into it.)"
282,Ross," C'mon, cut. Cut, cut, cut,... "
284,Rachel," Y'know what?  I think
we can just leave it at that.  It's kinda like a symbolic gesture..."
285,Monica,"  Rachel! 
That was a library card! "
287,Chandler," (as Rachel is cutting up
her cards) Y'know, if you listen closely, you can hear a thousand retailers scream. "
289,Monica," Welcome to the real world! It sucks. You're
gonna love it! "
291,Monica," Well, that's it (To Ross) You gonna crash on the couch? "
292,Ross," No. No, I gotta go home sometime. "
293,Monica, You be okay? 
294,Ross, Yeah. 
295,Rachel," Hey Mon, look what I just found on the floor. (Monica smiles.) What? "
296,Monica," That's Paul's watch. You just put it back where you found it. Oh boy.
Alright. Goodnight, everybody. "
299,Ross," Mmm. (They both reach for the last cookie) Oh, no- "
300,Rachel, Sorry- 
301,Ross," No no no, go- "
302,Rachel," No, you have it, really, I don't want it- "
303,Ross, Split it? 
304,Rachel, Okay. 
305,Ross," Okay. (They split it.) You know you probably didn't know this, but back in
high school, I had a, um, major crush on you. "
306,Rachel, I knew. 
307,Ross," You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky
older brother. "
308,Rachel, I did. 
309,Ross," Oh. Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability
become any kind of a factor here- but do you think it would be okay if I asked you out?
Sometime? Maybe? "
310,Rachel," Yeah, maybe... "
311,Ross," Okay... okay, maybe I will... "
312,Rachel, Goodnight. 
313,Ross, Goodnight. 
315,Monica," See ya.... Waitwait, what's with you? "
316,Ross," I just grabbed a spoon. (Ross exits and Monica has no idea what that
means.) "
319,Joey, I can't believe what I'm hearing here. 
320,Phoebe, (sings) I can't believe what I'm hearing here... 
321,Monica, What? I-I said you had a- 
322,Phoebe, (sings) What I said you had... 
323,Monica, (to Phoebe) Would you stop? 
324,Phoebe," Oh, was I doing it again?"
326,Monica," I said that you had a nice
butt, it's just not a great butt."
327,Joey," Oh, you wouldn't know a great
butt if it came up and bit ya."
328,Ross," There's an image.
"
329,Rachel, (walks up with a pot of coffee) Would anybody like more coffee? 
330,Chandler," Did you make it, or are you just serving it? "
331,Rachel, I'm just serving it. 
333,Chandler," Kids, new dream... I'm in Las Vegas. (Rachel
sits down to hear Chandler's dream.)"
335,Rachel," Ugh. (To another customer that's leaving.) Excuse me, could you give
this to that guy over there? (Hands him the coffee pot.) Go ahead. (He does so.) Thank
you. (To the gang.) Sorry.  Okay, Las Vegas."
336,Chandler," Okay, so, I'm in Las
Vegas... I'm Liza Minelli- "
0,Monica," What you guys don't understand is, for us,
kissing is as important as any part of it. "
1,Joey," Yeah, right!.......Y'serious? "
2,Phoebe," Oh, yeah! "
3,Rachel, Everything you need to know is in that first kiss. 
4,Monica, Absolutely. 
5,Chandler," Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act,
y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd
comes out. "
6,Ross," Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that...
that's not why we bought the ticket. "
7,Chandler," The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great
the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? I mean, we're
in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake. "
8,Rachel," Yeah, well, word of advice Bring back the comedian. Otherwise next time
you're gonna find yourself sitting at home, listening to that album alone. "
9,Joey, (pause)....Are we still talking about sex?
12,Ross," No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little
angry? "
14,Ross, Does she. 
16,Ross," Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that
glacier's getting kinda close.' See? "
19,Ross, (trying to ignore her) No. No. 
21,Ross," Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in
the Ice Age. "
23,Ross,Hi. 
25,Ross," You look great. I, uh... I hate that. "
27,Ross," Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still,
uh... "
29,Ross," Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family? "
31,Ross," Why- why are you here, Carol? "
33,Ross, Pregnant?! 
35,Chandler," Oh, I think this is the episode of Three's
Company where there's some kind of misunderstanding. "
36,Phoebe,...Then I've already seen this one! (Turns off the TV.) 
37,Monica, (taking a drink from Joey) Are you through with that? 
38,Joey," Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down. "
39,Monica, Whose little ball of paper is this?! 
40,Chandler," Oh, uh, that would be mine. See, I wrote a note to myself, and then I
realised I didn't need it, so I balled it up and... (sees that Monica is glaring at him)
...now I wish I was dead. "
42,Phoebe," She's already fluffed that pillow... Monica, you know, you've already
fluffed that- (Monica glares at her.) -but, it's fine! "
43,Monica," Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition
than they already have. "
44,Chandler," Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a
child's pillow. "
45,Phoebe," Monica- Hi! Um, Monica, you're scaring me. I mean, you're like, you're
like all chaotic and twirly. And not-not in a good way. "
46,Joey," Yeah, calm down. You don't see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly every
time they come. "
47,Monica," That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong.
Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born. "
48,Chandler," (looking out the window) Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew! "
49,Monica, What? 
50,Chandler, Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster! 
53,Rachel, Has anybody seen my engagement ring? 
54,Phoebe," Yeah, it's beautiful. "
55,Rachel," Oh God, oh God, oh God oh God oh God oh God.... (Starts to look under
the couch cushions.) "
56,Phoebe," No, look, don't touch that! "
57,Rachel," Oh, like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back to
him... 'Hi Barry! Remember me? I'm the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front
of your entire family!' Oh God and now I'm gonna have to return the ring, without the
ring, which makes it so much harder... "
58,Monica," Easy Rach, we'll find it. (To all) Won't we! "
60,Joey," Alright, when'd'ya have it on last?"
61,Phoebe, Doy! Probably right before she lost it! 
62,Chandler, You don't get a lot of 'doy' these days... 
63,Rachel," I know I had it this morning, and I know I had it when I was in the
kitchen with... "
64,Chandler, ...Dinah? 
65,Rachel," (looks at the lasagne and realizes something) Ohhhhh, don't be mad... "
66,Monica, You didn't. 
67,Rachel," Oh, I am sorry... "
68,Monica," I gave you one job! (Starts to examin the lasagne through the bottom of
the glass pan.) "
69,Rachel," Oh, but look how straight those noodles are! "
70,Chandler," Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring
in a lasagne... "
71,Monica, (puts down the lasagne) I just... can't do it. 
72,Chandler, Boys? We're going in. 
74,Ross, (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
75,Monica, Wow. That is not a happy hi. 
76,Ross, Carol's pregnant. 
77,Phoebe, (while everyone else is stunned) Ooh! I found it! 
78,Monica, W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... 
79,Ross," Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about
now. (He enters.) "
80,Chandler," Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, Mon? "
81,Rachel," Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing? "
82,Ross," Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not
comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me. "
83,Phoebe, She is so great! I miss her. 
84,Monica, What does she mean by 'involved'? 
85,Chandler," I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done. "
86,Ross," Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them
tomorrow. "
87,Rachel, So what are you gonna do? 
88,Ross," I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father. "
90,Joey," .....Well, this is still ruined, right?"
93,Monica, Curry. 
95,Ross," I- I think they're great! I, I really do. "
98,Ross," Aw, Mom... "
99,Monica," I'm sorry, why is this girl going to call me? "
101,Monica," No Mom, I don't have a restaurant, I work in a restaurant. "
103,Monica," Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? "
104,Ross, Yeah. (They go to the kitchen.) 
106,Monica," I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were you
planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing? Because I think it might take some
of the heat off me. "
111,Monica, What's that supposed to mean? 
113,Monica, No it's not. 
119,Monica," (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on
with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to
share with the folks? "
120,Ross," (pulls his hand away) Okay! Okay. (To his parents) Look, I, uh- I realise
you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well,
here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant
with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby. "
125,Joey," Your folks are really that bad, huh? "
126,Ross," Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they
take their time, they get the job done. "
127,Monica," Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you
could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours. "
128,Ross, Must pee. (Goes to pee.) 
129,Phoebe," Y'know, it's even worse when you're twins. "
130,Rachel, You're twins? 
131,Phoebe," Yeah. We don't speak. She's like this high-powered, driven career type. "
132,Chandler, What does she do? 
133,Phoebe, She's a waitress. 
134,Rachel," All right, you guys, I kinda gotta clean up now. (They all start to
leave.) "
135,Monica," Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this. "
136,Chandler," Well, no, although I did have an imaginary friend, who... my parents
actually preferred. "
137,Rachel," The lights, please.."
139,Ross, ...How long was I in there? 
140,Rachel, I'm just cleaning up. 
141,Ross, D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help? 
142,Rachel," Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks! (She hands him the broom and sits down.) "
143,Ross," Anyway.. um.. (Starts to sweep.) So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry
tomorrow? "
144,Rachel, Oh.. a little.. 
145,Ross, Mm-hmm.. 
146,Rachel, A lot. 
147,Ross, Mm. 
148,Rachel," So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped? "
149,Ross," Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's
gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too
terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give
Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN... "
150,Rachel," Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated? "
151,Ross, Got me. 
152,Rachel, Remember when we were in high school together? 
153,Ross, Yeah. 
154,Rachel," I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love-
and that'd be it? (Ross gazes at her.) ..Ross? "
155,Ross," Yes, yes! "
156,Rachel," Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here.. (She leans back onto his hand.) "
157,Ross," Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his
hand.) "
159,Ross," (entering) Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big
dinosaur.. thing.. anyway. "
163,Ross, How could I forget? 
165,Ross," (they shake hands) Hello, Susan. (To Carol) Good shake. Good shake. So,
uh, we're just waiting for...? "
167,Ross, ..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he- 
169,Ross," -she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation? "
171,Ross," Okay, that's great. (Susan gives her drink to Carol.) No, I'm- Oh.  "
173,Ross," (picks up a surgical instrament and mimes a duck with it) Quack, quack.. "
176,Rachel, Barry? 
178,Rachel, (hesitates) Are you sure? 
182,Rachel, I'm- uh- I'm okay... You look great! 
187,Rachel, I dumped him. 
190,Ross," So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? Y'know, with us? Y'know,
when, like, important decisions have to be made? "
192,Ross," Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the
baby's name? "
194,Ross, Marlon?! 
196,Ross, ...As in Mouse? 
198,Ross," Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about
Julia? "
201,Ross," 'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together.
Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..? "
204,Rachel," Oh, not much. I-I got a job. "
206,Rachel, Why are- why are you so tanned? 
208,Rachel, Oh no. You went on our honeymoon alone? 
212,Rachel," Mindy?! My maid of honour, Mindy?! "
214,Rachel," Oh! Well, um.. (Grabs his forehand) You've got plugs! "
216,Rachel, And you've got lenses! But you hate sticking your finger in your eye! 
218,Rachel, Okay.. 
220,Rachel, Wow. 
222,Rachel, What? 
224,Rachel," Anyway, um, (Gets the ring out of her purse.) I guess this belongs to
you. And thank you for giving it to me. "
230,Ross, Helen Geller? I don't think so. 
232,Ross, Thank you! 
234,Ross," What, it's gonna be Helen Willick? "
236,Ross," Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title? "
238,Ross," Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm. "
241,Ross," No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too. "
243,Ross," Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch. "
245,Ross," My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever
imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is
too hard. I'm not, I can't do- "
249,Ross," You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be
involved in this particular thing right now. "
251,Ross, Oh my God. 
256,Ross, Well? Isn't that amazing? 
257,Joey, What are we supposed to be seeing here? 
258,Chandler," I dunno, but.. I think it's about to attack the Enterprise. "
259,Phoebe," You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it
kinda looks like an old potato. "
260,Ross," Then don't do that, alright? "
261,Phoebe, Okay! 
262,Ross, (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
263,Monica, (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
264,Ross, Wh- are you welling up? 
265,Monica, No. 
266,Ross," You are, you're welling up. "
267,Monica, Am not! 
268,Ross, You're gonna be an aunt. 
269,Monica, (pushes him and starts to cry) Oh shut up! 
270,Rachel," (on phone) Hi, Mindy. Hi, it-it's Rachel. Yeah, I'm fine. I-I saw Barry
today. Oh, yeah, yeah he-he told me. No, no, it's okay. I hope you two are very happy, I
really do. Oh, oh, and Mind, y'know, if-if everything works out, and you guys end up
getting married and having kids- and everything- I just hope they have his old hairline
and your old nose. (Slams the phone down.) (To everyone) Okay, I know it was a cheap shot,
but I feel so much better now. "
0,Phoebe, (entering) Hi guys! 
2,Ross," Hey. Oh, oh, how'd it go? "
3,Phoebe," Um, not so good. He walked me to the subway and said 'We should do this
again!' "
5,Rachel," What? He said 'we should do it again', that's good, right? "
6,Monica," Uh, no. Loosely translated 'We should do this again' means 'You will
never see me naked'. "
7,Rachel, Since when? 
8,Joey," Since always. It's like dating language. Y'know, like 'It's not you' means
'It is you'. "
9,Chandler," Or 'You're such a nice guy' means 'I'm gonna be dating leather-wearing
alcoholics and complaining about them to you'. "
10,Phoebe," Or, or, y'know, um, 'I think we should see other people' means 'Ha, ha,
I already am'. "
11,Rachel, And everybody knows this? 
12,Joey, Yeah. Cushions the blow. 
13,Chandler," Yeah, it's like when you're a kid, and your parents put your dog to
sleep, and they tell you it went off to live on some farm. "
14,Ross," That's funny, that, no, because, uh, our parents actually did, uh, send
our dog off to live on a farm. "
15,Monica," Uh, Ross. "
16,Ross," What? Wh- hello? The Millners' farm in Connecticut? The Millners, they had
this unbelievable farm, they had horses, and, and rabbits that he could chase and it was-
it w- .....Oh my God, Chi Chi! "
19,Chandler," ""So how does it feel knowing you're about to die?"" "
20,Joey," ""Warden, in five minutes my pain will be over. But you'll have to
live with the knowledge that you sent an honest man to die."" "
21,Chandler," Hey, that was really good! "
22,Joey, Thanks! Let's keep going. 
23,Chandler," Okay. ""So. Whaddya want from me, Damone, huh?"" "
24,Joey," ""I just wanna go back to my cell. 'Cause in my cell, I can
smoke."" "
25,Chandler," ""Smoke away."" "
27,Chandler, I think this is probably why Damone smokes in his cell alone. 
28,Joey, What? 
29,Chandler, Relax your hand! 
31,Chandler, Not so much! 
32,Joey, Whoah! 
33,Chandler, Hey! 
34,Joey, Hey! 
35,Chandler," Alright, now try taking a puff. "
37,Chandler, Alright.. okay. No. Give it to me. 
38,Joey," No no no, I am not giving you a cigarette. "
39,Chandler," It's fine, it's fine. Look, do you wanna get this part, or not? Here. "
41,Chandler," Don't think of it as a cigarette. Think of it as the thing that's been
missing from your hand. When you're holding it, you feel right. You feel complete. "
42,Joey, Y'miss it? 
43,Chandler," Nah, not so much. Alright, now we smoke. (Takes a puff.) Oh.. my..
God. (He continues to smoke.) "
45,Monica," No, no, no. They say it's the same as the distance from the tip of a
guy's thumb to the tip of his index finger. "
47,Joey, That's ridiculous! 
48,Ross, Can I use.. either thumb? 
49,Rachel," (carrying a tray of drinks) Alright, don't tell me, don't tell me!
(Starts handing them out.) Decaf cappucino for Joey.. Coffee black.. Late.. And an iced
tea. I'm getting pretty good at this! "
51,Rachel, (leaving to serve others) Good for me! 
53,Joey," Y'okay, Phoebe? "
54,Phoebe," Yeah- no- I'm just- it's, I haven't worked- It's my bank. "
55,Monica, What did they do to you? 
56,Phoebe," It's nothing, it's just- Okay. I'm going through my mail, and I open up
their monthly, you know, STATEMENT- "
57,Ross, Easy. 
58,Phoebe, - and there's five hundred extra dollars in my account. 
59,Chandler," Oh, Satan's minions at work again... "
60,Phoebe," Yes, 'cause now I have to go down there, and deal with them. "
61,Joey, What are you talking about? Keep it! 
62,Phoebe," It's not mine, I didn't earn it, if I kept it, it would be like
stealing. "
63,Rachel," Yeah, but if you spent it, it would be like shopping! "
64,Phoebe," Okay. Okay, let's say I bought a really great pair of shoes. Do you know
what I'd hear, with every step I took? 'Not-mine. Not-mine. Not-mine.' And even if I was
happy, okay, and, and skipping- 'Not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine,
not-not-mine'... "
65,Monica, We're with you. We got it. 
67,Phoebe," Okay. I'd- just- I'd never be able to enjoy it. It would be like this
giant karmic debt. "
68,Rachel," Chandler, what are you doing? "
69,Monica, (puling him up) Hey. Whaddya doing? 
72,Ross, What is this?! 
73,Chandler," I'm smoking. I'm smoking, I'm smoking. "
74,Phoebe," Oh, I can't believe you! You've been so good, for three years! "
75,Chandler, And this- is my reward! 
76,Ross," Hold on a second, alright? Just think about what you went through the last
time you quit. "
77,Chandler," Okay, so this time I won't quit! "
79,Chandler," All right! I'm putting it out, I'm putting it out. (He drops it in
Phoebe's coffee.) "
80,Phoebe," Oh, no! I- I can't drink this now! "
81,Monica," Alright. I'm gonna go change, I've got a date. "
82,Rachel, This Alan again? How's it goin'? 
83,Monica," 'S'going pretty good, y'know? It's nice, and, we're having fun. "
84,Joey, So when do we get to meet the guy? 
85,Monica," Let's see, today's Monday... Never. "
87,Monica, No. Not after what happened with Steve. 
88,Chandler," What are you talking about? We love Schhteve! Schhteve was schhexy!..
Sorry. "
89,Monica," Look, I don't even know how I feel about him yet. Just give me a chance
to figure that out. "
90,Rachel," Well, then can we meet him? "
91,Monica, Nope. Schhorry. 
93,Monica," I mean, why should I let them meet him? I mean, I bring a guy home, and
within five minutes they're all over him. I mean, they're like- coyotes, picking off the
weak members of the herd. "
95,Monica," I know. I just wish that once, I'd bring a guy home that they actually
liked. "
98,Joey," Let it go, Ross. "
99,Ross," Yeah, well, you didn't know Chi Chi. "
100,Monica, Do you all promise? 
102,Monica, (shouts to Chandler) Chandler? Do you promise to be good? 
104,Joey," You can come in, but your filter-tipped little buddy has to stay outside! "
107,Ross," Hey, Pheebs. "
108,Phoebe," 'Dear Ms. Buffay. Thank you for calling attention to our error. We have
credited your account with five hundred dollars. We're sorry for the inconvenience, and
hope you'll accept this- (Searches in her purse) -football phone as our free gift.'
Do you believe this?! Now I have a thousand dollars, and a football phone! "
109,Rachel, What bank is this? 
111,Monica, Hey. It's him. (On the intercom) Who is it? 
113,Joey, (shouting to Chandler) Chandler! He's here! 
115,Monica," (to all) Okay, please be good, please. Just remember how much you
all like me. "
117,Monica," Hi. Alan, this is everybody. Everybody, this is Alan. "
123,Monica," (to Alan) Thanks. I'll call you tomorrow. (Alan exits, to all) Okay.
Okay, let's let the Alan-bashing begin. Who's gonna take the first shot, hmm? "
125,Monica, C'mon! 
126,Ross," ...I'll go. Let's start with the way he kept picking at- no, I'm sorry, I
can't do this, can't do this. We loved him. "
128,Monica," Wait a minute! We're talking about someone that I'm going out
with? "
130,Rachel, And did you notice...? (She spreads her thumb and index finger.) 
132,Joey, Know what was great? The way his smile was kinda crooked. 
133,Phoebe," Yes, yes! Like the man in the shoe! "
134,Ross, ...What shoe? 
135,Phoebe," From the nursery rhyme. 'There was a crooked man, Who had a crooked
smile, Who lived in a shoe, For a... while...' "
137,Ross," ...So I think Alan will become the yardstick against which all future
boyfriends will be measured. "
138,Rachel," What future boyfriends? Nono, I th- I think this could be, y'know, it. "
139,Monica, Really! 
140,Chandler," Oh, yeah. I'd marry him just for his David Hasselhof impression alone.
You know I'm gonna be doing that at parties, right? (Does the impression) "
141,Ross," You know what I like most about him, though? "
143,Ross, The way he makes me feel about myself. 
147,Monica, Hi.. how was the game? 
148,Ross, Well.. 
150,Monica, Fantastic! I have one question How is that possible? 
151,Joey, Alan. 
152,Ross," He was unbelievable. He was like that-that-that Bugs Bunny cartoon where
Bugs is playing all the positions, right, but instead of Bugs it was first base-Alan,
second base-Alan, third base-... "
153,Rachel," I mean, it-it was like, it was like he made us into a team. "
154,Chandler," Yep, we sure showed those Hassidic jewellers a thing or two about
softball.. "
155,Monica," Can I ask you guys a question? D'you ever think that Alan is maybe..
sometimes.. "
156,Ross, What? 
157,Monica," ..I dunno, a little too Alan? "
158,Rachel," Well, no. That's impossible. You can never be too Alan. "
159,Ross," Yeah, it's his, uh, innate Alan-ness that-that-that we adore. "
160,Chandler, I personally could have a gallon of Alan. 
162,Phoebe," Hey, Lizzie. "
164,Phoebe, I brought you alphabet soup. 
166,Phoebe," Yes. But I left in the Ys. 'Cause, y'know, ""sometimes y"". Uh,
I also have something else for you. (She searches in her purse.) "
168,Phoebe," No, but would you like a thousand dollars and a football phone? "
170,Phoebe, I know. 
172,Phoebe," No, I want you to have it. I don't want it. "
174,Phoebe," Oh, that's fine, no. "
176,Phoebe," No. 'Cause you need that. No, it's okay, thanks. "
178,Phoebe," Okay, alright, you buy me a soda, and then we're even. Okay? "
180,Phoebe, Okay. 
184,Phoebe," No, I'm fine. "
187,Phoebe, Huh! 
189,Ross, A thumb?! 
192,Phoebe," I know! I know, I opened it up and there it was, just floating in there,
like this tiny little hitch-hiker! "
193,Chandler," Well, maybe it's a contest, y'know? Like, collect all five? "
194,Phoebe," Does, um, anyone wanna see? "
198,Rachel, It's worse than the thumb! 
199,Chandler," Hey, this is so unfair! "
200,Monica," Oh, why is it unfair? "
201,Chandler," So I have a flaw! Big deal! Like Joey's constant knuckle-cracking
isn't annoying? And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word? And Monica, with
that snort when she laughs? I mean, what the hell is that thing? ...I accept all those
flaws, why can't you accept me for this? "
203,Joey, ...Does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody? 
204,Rachel," Well, I-I could live without it. "
205,Joey," Well, is it, like, a little annoying, or is it like when Phoebe chews her
hair? "
207,Ross," Oh, now, don't listen to him, Pheebs, I think it's endearing. "
208,Joey," Oh, (Imitating Ross) ""you do, do you""? "
210,Ross," You know, there's nothing wrong with speaking correctly. "
211,Rachel," ""Indeed there isn't""... I should really get back to work. "
212,Phoebe," Yeah, 'cause otherwise someone might get what they actually ordered. "
213,Rachel," Ohh-ho-hooohhh. The hair comes out, and the gloves come on. "
216,Monica, Did you ever go out with a guy your friends all really like? 
218,Monica," Okay.. Well, I'm going out with a guy my friends all really like. "
220,Monica," Can you believe it? ...Y'know what? I just don't feel the thing.
I mean, they feel the thing, I don't feel the thing. "
222,Monica, I know.. it's gonna be really hard. 
224,Monica," No, he'll be fine. It's the other five I'm worried about. "
226,Joey, Do you have any respect for your body? 
227,Ross, Don't you realise what you're-you're doing to yourself? 
228,Chandler," Hey, y'know, I have had it with you guys and your cancer and your
emphysema and your heart disease. The bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it. "
229,Rachel," (holding the phone out to Chandler) Chandler? It's Alan, he wants to
speak to you. "
230,Chandler," Really? He does? (taking the phone) Hey, buddy, what's up! Oh, she
told you about that, huh. Well, yeah, I have one now and then. Well, yeah, now. Well, it's
not that big- ..well, that's true,.. Gee, y'know, no-one- no-one's ever put it like that
before. Well, okay, thanks! (He hands the phone back and stubs out his cigarette.) "
231,Rachel," (to Ross, who has wandered up) God, he's good. "
232,Ross, If only he were a woman. 
233,Rachel, Yeah. 
236,Chandler," Ooh, Lambchop. How old is that sock? If I had a sock on my hand for
thirty years it'd be talking too. "
237,Ross, Okay. I think it's time to change somebody's nicotine patch. (Does so.) 
238,Monica, (entering) Hey. Where's Joey? 
239,Chandler," Joey ate my last stick of gum, so I killed him. Do you think that was
wrong? "
240,Rachel, I think he's across the hall. 
241,Monica, Thanks. (Goes to fetch him.) 
242,Ross, (finishing changing Chandler's nicotine patch) There y'go. 
243,Chandler," (deadpan) Ooh, I'm alive with pleasure now. "
244,Ross," Hey Pheebs, you gonna have the rest of that Pop-Tart?.. Pheebs? "
245,Phoebe, Does anyone want the rest of this Pop-Tart? 
246,Ross," Hey, I might! "
247,Phoebe," Sorry. ..Y'know, those stupid soda people gave me seven thousand dollars
for the thumb. "
249,Phoebe," And on my way over here, I stepped in gum. ...What is up with the
universe?! "
250,Joey," (dragged in by Monica, he has just gotten out of the shower) What's going
on? "
251,Monica, Nothing. I just think it's nice when we're all here together. 
252,Joey, Even nicer when everyone gets to wear their underwear.. 
253,Rachel," Uh, Joey.. "
254,Joey," Oh, God! (Hurriedly closes his legs.) "
255,Monica, (turns off the TV) Okay.. 
257,Monica," Please, guys, we have to talk. "
258,Phoebe," Wait, wait, I'm getting a deja vu...no, I'm not. "
259,Monica," Alright, we have to talk. "
260,Phoebe, There it is! 
261,Monica," Okay. It's-it's about Alan. There's something that you should know. I
mean, there's really no easy way to say this.. uh.. I've decided to break up with Alan. "
263,Ross, Is there somebody else? 
264,Monica," No, nononono.. it's just.. things change. People change. "
265,Rachel, We didn't change.. 
266,Joey, So that's it? It's over? Just like that? 
267,Phoebe," You know.. you let your guard down, you start to really care about
someone, and I just- I- (starts chewing her hair) "
268,Monica," Look, I- I could go on pretending- "
269,Joey, Okay! 
270,Monica," -but that wouldn't be fair to me, it wouldn't be fair to Alan- It
wouldn't be fair to you! "
271,Ross," Who-who wants fair? Y'know, I just want things back. Y'know, the way they
were. "
272,Monica, I'm sorry.. 
273,Chandler," (sarcastic) Oh, she's sorry! I feel better! "
274,Rachel," (tearful) I just can't believe this! I mean, with the holidays coming
up- I wanted him to meet my family- "
275,Monica, I'll meet somone else. There'll be other Alans. 
277,Monica, Are you guys gonna be okay? 
278,Ross," Hey hey, we'll be fine. We're just gonna need a little time. "
279,Monica, (dubious) I understand. 
282,Monica," I'm, I'm really sorry. "
284,Monica, Relieved? 
288,Rachel, Remember when we went to Central Park and rented boats?.. That was fun. 
289,Ross, Yeah. He could row like a viking. 
290,Monica, (entering) Hi. 
292,Ross, So how'd it go? 
293,Monica," Oh, y'know.. "
294,Phoebe, Did he mention us? 
295,Monica, He said he's really gonna miss you guys. (dubious look) 
296,Ross," You had a rough day, huh.. c'mere. (She sits down and Ross strokes her
forehead.) "
297,Chandler, ...That's it. I'm getting cigarettes. 
299,Chandler," (leaving) I don't care, I don't care! Game's over! I'm weak! I've
gotta smoke! I've gotta have the smoke! "
300,Phoebe," (shouting as he leaves) If you never smoke again I'll give you seven
thousand dollars! "
301,Chandler," (returns) Yeah, alright."
0,Monica, Alright. Phoebe? 
1,Phoebe," Okay, okay. If I were omnipotent for a day,
I would want, um, world peace, no more hunger, good things for the rain-forest...And
bigger boobs! "
2,Ross," Yeah, see.. you took mine. Chandler, what
about you? "
3,Chandler," Uh, if I were omnipotent for a day, I'd..
make myself omnipotent forever. "
4,Rachel," See, there's always one guy. (Mocking)
""If I had a wish, I'd wish for three more wishes."" (Joey enters.) "
6,Monica," Hey, Joey, what would you do if you were
omnipotent? "
7,Joey, Probably kill myself! 
8,Monica, ..Excuse me? 
9,Joey," Hey, if Little Joey's dead, then I got no
reason to live! "
10,Ross," Joey, uh- OMnipotent. "
11,Joey," You are? Ross, I'm sorry.. "
14,Monica, How does she do that? 
15,Ross, I cannot sleep in a public place. 
16,Monica, Would you look at her? She is so peaceful. 
17,Phoebe," (waking and startling them) Oh! What what
what! ...Hi. "
18,Ross," It's okay, y'know, you just nodded off again. "
19,Monica, What's going on with you? 
20,Phoebe, I got no sleep last night! 
21,Ross, Why? 
22,Phoebe," My grandmother has this new boyfriend, and
they're both kind of insecure in bed. Oh, and deaf. So they're constantly, like, having to
reassure each other that they're having a good time. You have no idea how loud they are! "
23,Monica," Well, if you want, you can stay with Rachel
and me tonight. "
24,Phoebe, Thanks. 
26,Joey," ...Ninety-five, ninety-six, ninety-seven. See,
I told you! Less than a hundred steps from our place to here. "
27,Chandler, You got waaaay too much free time. 
28,Joey," (to Ross) Hey! Here's the birthday boy! Ross,
check it out hockey tickets, Rangers-Penguins, tonight at the Garden, and we're taking
you. "
29,Chandler," Happy birthday, pal! "
30,Joey," We love you, man. (Kisses Ross) "
31,Ross," Funny, my birthday was seven months ago. "
32,Joey, So? 
33,Ross," So, I'm guessing you had an extra ticket and
couldn't decide which one of you got to bring a date? "
34,Chandler," Well, aren't we Mr. ""The glass is
half empty."" "
35,Ross," Oh my God, oh- is today the twentieth, October
twentieth? "
36,Monica," Oh, I was hoping you wouldn't remember. "
37,Ross, Ohhh. 
38,Joey, What's wrong with the twentieth? 
39,Chandler," Eleven days before Halloween.. all the
good costumes are gone? "
40,Ross," Today's the day Carol and I first..
consummated our physical relationship. (Joey is puzzled.) Sex. ..You know what, I-I'd
better pass on the game. I think I'm just gonna go home and think about my ex-wife and her
lesbian lover. "
41,Joey," The hell with hockey, let's all do that! "
42,Chandler," (trying to stop Ross leaving) C'mon, Ross!
You, me, Joey, ice, guys' night out, c'mon, whaddya say, big guy, (Pretending to punch him
in the stomach.) Huh? Huh? Huh? "
43,Ross, What are you doing? 
44,Chandler, (stops) I have no idea. 
45,Joey," C'mon, Ross! "
46,Ross," Alright, alright, maybe it'll take my mind off
it. Do you promise to buy me a big thumb finger? "
47,Chandler, You got it.
49,Rachel," Look-look-look-look-look, my first pay
check! Look at the window, there's my name! Hi, me! "
50,Phoebe," I remember the day I got my first pay check.
There was a cave in in one of the mines, and eight people were killed. "
51,Monica," Wow, you worked in a mine? "
52,Phoebe," I worked in a Dairy Queen, why? "
53,Rachel," God, isn't this exciting? I earned this. I
wiped tables for it, I steamed milk for it, and it was totally—(opens
envelope)—not worth it. Who's FICA? Why's he getting all my money? I mean, what-
Chandler, look at that. "
54,Chandler," (looking) Oh, this is not that bad. "
55,Joey," Oh, you're fine, yeah, for a first job. "
56,Ross," You can totally, totally live on this. "
57,Monica," Yeah, yeah. "
58,Ross," Oh, by the way, great service
tonight. "
63,Rachel," Oh my God! (Rachel, Leslie, Kiki, and Joanne
all scream and hug each other. "
64,Monica," (to Phoebe) I swear I've seen birds do this
on Wild Kingdom. "
65,Rachel, What are you guys doing here? 
68,Rachel," (to a pregnant Leslie) Look at you, you are
so big I can't believe it! "
70,Rachel, (to Joanne) So what's going on with you? 
73,Phoebe," (to Monica) Look, look, I have elbows! (They
scream.)"
75,Chandler," ...Poulet passes it up to Leetch! (Passes
it to Joey.) "
76,Joey," Leetch spots Messier in the crease- there's
the pass! (He kicks it to Ross, but Ross is staring into a shop window.) "
77,Chandler," We'll take a brief time out while Messier
stops to look at some women's shoes. "
78,Ross," Carol was wearing boots just like those the
night that we- we first- y'know. Fact, she, uh- she never took'em off, 'cause we-we- (off
Chandler's look) Sorry. Sorry. "
80,Joey, What? 
81,Ross, Peach pit. 
82,Chandler," Yes, Bunny? "
83,Ross," (points) Peach pit. That night we, uh- we had-
"
84,Joey, -Peaches? 
85,Ross," Actually, nectarines, but basically... "
86,Chandler, (to Joey) Could've been a peach. 
87,Ross," Then, uh, then we got dressed, and I-I... I
walked her to the- (looks up, realises, and points) -the bus stop... I'm fine."
88,Joey," Hey, that woman's got an ass like Carol's!
(They turn to stare at him.) What? Thought we were trying to find stuff. "
90,Rachel," So c'mon, you guys, tell me all the dirt! "
93,Rachel, Okay. 
95,Rachel," What? Guys, I'm not. "
97,Rachel," I'm not! This is what I'm doing now. I've
got this job- "
99,Rachel," Okay, I'm not just waitressing. I'm.. I,
um... I write the specials on the specials board, and, uh... and I, uh... I take the uh
dead flowers out of the vase... Oh, and, um, sometimes Artelle lets me put the little
chocolate blobbies on the cookies. "
102,Monica," Hey, Rach. How was it with your friends?
(She and Phoebe scream.) Okay! How would you like some Tiki Death Punch? (She pours the
contents of the blender into some glasses.) "
103,Rachel, What's that? 
104,Monica," Weeeell, it's rum, and- "
105,Rachel," Okay. (Grabs the blender and starts to
drink.) "
106,Monica," We thought since Phoebe was staying over
tonight we'd have kinda like a slumber party thing. We got some trashy magazines, we got
cookie dough, we got Twister... (The phone rings and Monica answers it.) "
107,Phoebe," Ooh! Ooh! And I brought Operation!
But, um, I lost the tweezers, so we can't operate. But we can prep the guy! "
108,Monica," Uh, Rach, it's the Visa card
people. "
109,Rachel," Oh, God, ask them what they want. "
110,Monica," (on phone) Could you please tell me what
this is in reference to? (Listens) Yes, hold on. (To Rachel) Um, they say there's been
some unusual activity on your account. "
111,Rachel, But I haven't used my card in weeks! 
112,Monica," That is the unusual
activity. Look, they just wanna see if you're okay. "
113,Rachel," They wanna know if I'm okay. Okay.. they
wanna know if I'm okay, okay, let's see. Well, let's see, the FICA guys took all my money,
everyone I know is either getting married, or getting promoted, or getting pregnant, and
I'm getting coffee! And it's not even for me! So if that sounds like I'm okay, okay, then
you can tell them I'm okay, okay? "
114,Monica," (pauses then on the phone) Uh- Rachel has
left the building, can you call back? "
115,Rachel," Alright, c'mon! (Miserably) Let's play Twister!"
117,Ross," (squeezing past people) Sorry, sorry... Uh-oh.
"
118,Chandler," What? There was ice there that night with
Carol? Plastic seats? Four thousand angry Pittsburgh fans? "
119,Ross," No, actually I was just saying it looks like
we're not sitting together. But now you mention it, there was ice there that
night... It was the first frost... "
120,Joey," C'mon, sit. Just sit down, sit. "
122,Monica," You should feel great about yourself! You're
doing this amazing independence thing! "
123,Rachel," Monica, what is so amazing? I gave up, like,
everything. And for what? "
124,Phoebe, You are just like Jack. 
125,Rachel, ...Jack from downstairs? 
126,Phoebe," No, Jack and the Beanstalk. "
127,Monica," Ah, the other Jack. "
128,Phoebe," Yeah, right! See, he gave up something, but
then he got those magic beans. And then he woke up, and there was this, this big plant
outside his window, full of possibilities and stuff.. And he lived in a village, and you
live in the Village.. "
129,Rachel," Okay, but Pheebs, Pheebs, Jack gave up a
cow, I gave up an orthodontist. Okay, I-I-I know, I know I didn't love him- "
130,Phoebe," Oh, see, Jack did love the cow. "
131,Rachel," But see, it was a plan. Y'know, it was
clear. It was figured out, and now everything's just kinda like... "
132,Phoebe, Floopy? 
133,Rachel, Yeah. 
134,Monica," So what, you're not the only one. I mean,
half the time we don't know where we're going. You've just gotta figure at some point it's
all gonna come together, and it's just gonna be... un-floopy. "
135,Phoebe," Oh, like that's a word. "
136,Rachel," Okay, but Monica, what if- what if it
doesn't come together? "
137,Monica, ...Pheebs? 
138,Phoebe," Oh, well... 'cause.... you just... I don't
like this question. "
139,Rachel," Okay, see, see, you guys, what if we don't
get magic beans? I mean, what if all we've got are.. beans? "
141,Ross," Get him! GET HIM! Get him! Get- YESSS! Not
laughing now, are ya pal! "
142,Chandler," (to Ross) See buddy, that's all you need,
a bunch of toothless guys hitting each other with sticks. "
143,Ross, Pass it! Pass it! 
144,Chandler, He's open! 
147,Chandler," Hey, look, we're on that TV thing! "
151,Chandler, (to the receptionist)'Scuse me. 
153,Chandler," Listen, it's kind of an emergency. Well, I
guess you know that, or we'd be in the predicament room. (The receptionist glares at him.)
"
155,Ross," (jumping to his feet) Look, I don't wanna make
any trouble, okay, but I'm in a lot of pain here, alright? My face is dented. "
157,Joey," Well, how long do you think it'll be? "
159,Ross," Hey, this- (she gives him a look and the guys
back off) Heyy... "
161,Rachel," I'm so sorry, you guys. I didn't mean to
bring you down. "
162,Monica," No, you were right. I don't have a plan.
(There's a knock on the door.) "
164,Rachel," Thank God. Food. (She goes to answer the
door.) "
165,Monica, Phoebe? 
166,Phoebe, What? 
167,Monica, Do you have a plan? 
168,Phoebe, I don't even have a 'pl'. 
170,Rachel," (miserably) No, no, that's not what we
ordered... We ordered a fat-free crust with extra cheese. "
172,Monica," (leaping off of the couch and runs up) Wait!
Did you say 'G.Stephanopoulos?' "
174,Monica," Wait, was this a-a small mediterranean guy
with curiously intelligent good looks? "
176,Monica, Was he wearing a stunning blue suit? 
177,Phoebe, And-and a power tie? 
179,Monica, (staggered) Oh God. 
181,Monica," Are you nuts?! We've got George
Stephanopoulos' pizza! (Rachel pays him, Monica grabs some binoculars, and runs to the
window.) "
182,Rachel," Uh, Pheebs? Who's George Snuffalopagus? "
183,Phoebe, Big Bird's friend. 
184,Monica, I see pizza! 
185,Phoebe," Oh, I wanna see! Lemme see! Lemme see! (She
runs up and takes the binoculars.) "
186,Rachel, Hello? Who are we spying on? 
187,Monica," White House adviser? Clinton's campaign guy?
The one with the great hair, sexy smile, really cute butt? "
188,Rachel," Oh, him, the little guy? Oh, I love him! "
189,Phoebe," Ooh, wait.. wait, I see a woman. "
190,Monica, Please tell me it's his mother. 
191,Phoebe, Definitely not his mother. 
192,Monica," Oh, no... "
193,Phoebe," Oh, wait, she's walking across the floor..
she's walking.. she's walking.. she's going for the pizza- (Yelling) Hey, that's not for
you, bitch! (Phoebe covers her mouth with her hand walks away from the window.) "
195,Chandler," Excuse me, look, we've been here for over
an hour, and a lot of people less sick than my friend have gone in. I mean, that guy with
the toe thing? Who's he sleeping with? (She slides the gladd panel over and Chandler talks
through it in a loud voice.) Oh, c'mon Dora, don't be mad... I know we both said some
things we didn't mean, but that doesn't mean we still don't love each other. (To the
waiting room.) Y'know, I feel like I've lost her.. (She slides the panel back, he turns,
and it takes him by surprise.) Ba-! "
197,Monica, Light still out? 
198,Rachel, Yeah. 
199,Monica, Oh. Maybe they're- napping. 
200,Rachel," Oh please, they're having sex. "
202,Rachel," So, whaddya think George is like? "
203,Monica, I think he's shy. 
204,Phoebe, Yeah? 
205,Monica," Yeah. I think you have to draw him out. And
then- when you do- he's a preppy animal. "
207,Ross," I remember the moonlight coming through the
window- and her face had the most incredible glow. "
208,Chandler," Yes, the moon, the glow, the magical
feeling, you did this part- Could I get some painkillers over here, please? "
209,Joey," He's right, enough, already. What is the big
deal about today? So you slept with her for the first time, so what? You slept with her
for seven years after that. "
210,Ross," Look, it's just a little more complicated... "
211,Chandler," Well, what? What? What is it? That she
left you? That she likes women? That she left you for another woman that likes women? "
212,Ross," Little louder, okay, I think there's a man on
the twelfth floor in a coma that didn't quite hear you... "
213,Chandler, Then what? 
214,Ross," My first time with Carol was... (He mumbles
the last part) "
215,Joey, What? 
216,Ross, It was my first time. 
217,Joey, With Carol? (Ross gives him a look.) Oh. 
218,Chandler," So in your whole life, you've only been
with one—(He gets a look too)—oh. "
219,Joey," Whoah, boy, hockey was a big mistake! There
was a whole bunch of stuff we could've done tonight! "
221,Monica," Okay. Okay, I got one. Do you remember that
vegetarian pate that I made that you loved so much? "
222,Phoebe, Uh-huh. 
223,Monica," Well, unless goose is a vegetable...ha
haaaah! "
224,Phoebe," Oh! Oh! Oh! Okay, fine, fine. Now I don't
feel so bad about sleeping with Jason Hurley. "
225,Monica, What?! You slept with Jason? 
226,Phoebe, You'd already broken up. 
227,Rachel, How long? 
228,Phoebe, A couple hours. 
229,Monica," Oh, that's nice! "
230,Rachel," Okay, okay, okay, I got one! (She sits up
and the cushion she was leaning against falls off of the balcony.) Anyway- The valentine
Tommy Rollerson left in your locker was really from me. "
231,Monica, Excuse me?! 
232,Rachel," Hello? Like he was really gonna send you
one? (To Phoebe) She was a big girl. "
233,Monica," Really. Well, at least 'big girls' don't pee
in their pants in seventh grade! "
234,Rachel," I was laughing! You made me laugh! (Monica
and Rachel start to squabble) "
235,Phoebe, There he is! There he is! 
236,Monica, Where? 
237,Phoebe, Right- where we've been looking all night! 
238,Rachel, He is so cute! 
239,Monica," Oh, George, baby, drop the towel! "
242,Joey," Man. Can you believe he's only had sex with
one woman? "
243,Chandler," I think it's great. Y'know, it's sweet,
it's romantic... "
244,Joey, Really? 
245,Chandler," No, you kidding? The guy's a freak.. (Ross
enters off camera) "
247,Ross," Hi. (He is wearing a piece of steel bandaged
to his nose.  He tosses some forms onto reception desk.) "
249,Chandler," Oh, I thought you were great in Silence of
the Lambs. Oh come on, admit it! All things considered, you had fun tonight. "
250,Ross," Fun? Where was the fun? Tell me specifically,
which part was the fun part? Where's my puck? "
251,Joey," Oh, ah- the kid has it. "
252,Ross," The kid...? (To the kid) Excuse me, uh,
that's, that's my puck. "
254,Chandler," You gotta do it, man. "
255,Ross," (to the kid) Oh yeah? Well, I'm rubber, you're
glue, whatever—(to Chandler)—can't do it. (to the kid) Listen, uh- gimme back my
puck. "
257,Ross," 'Yes', how about. C'mere. Gimme! "
260,Ross," (tries to snatch it from the kid) GIVE ME MY
PUCK!! (but it files out of his grasp and knocks out the receptionist) "
261,Ross, ...Now that was fun. 
264,Ross," (Doing the spinning) Okay, Monica Right foot
red. "
265,Monica," Could've played Monopoly, but
nooooo. "
267,Chandler, Thanks. (The guy nods and leaves) 
268,Ross," Okay, Pheebs Right hand blue. (Phoebe has to
bend over.)Good. (Joey stares at her butt appreciatively) "
270,Chandler," Hello? Oh, uh, Rachel, it's the Visa card
people. "
271,Rachel," Oh, okay. Will you take my place? "
272,Chandler," Alright. (on phone) Yes, this is Rachel. "
273,Rachel," Nooo! (She grabs the phone and Chandler
takes her place on the mat.) (On phone) Hello? (Listens) Oh, yeah, no, I know, I-I haven't
been using it much. (Listens) Oh, well, thanks, but, I'm okay, really. "
274,Ross, Green. To the green. 
275,Rachel," (on phone) I've got magic beans. (Listens)
Never-never mind. "
276,Chandler," To the left, to the left- aww! (They all
collapse) "
277,Rachel, (on phone) Ohhh... I'm fine.
0,Monica, Would you let it go? It's not that big a deal.
1,Ross," Not that big a deal? It's amazing. Ok, you just reach in there, there's
one little maneuver, and bam, a bra right out the sleeve. All right, as far as I'm
concerned, there is nothing a guy can do that even comes close. Am I right?"
2,Rachel, Come on! You guys can pee standing up.
3,Chandler," We can? All right, I'm tryin' that."
4,Joey," Ok, you know what blows my mind? Women can see breasts any time they want.
You just look down and there they are. How you get any work done is beyond me."
5,Phoebe," Oh, ok, you know what I don't get? The way guys can do so many mean
things, and then not even care."
7,Ross, Multiple orgasms!
9,Chandler," So, Saturday night, the big night, date night, Saturday night,
Sat-ur-day night!"
10,Joey," No plans, huh?"
11,Chandler, Not a one.
12,Ross," Not even, say, breaking up with Janice?"
13,Chandler," Oh, right, right, shut up."
14,Monica," Chandler, nobody likes breaking up with someone. You just gotta do it."
15,Chandler," No, I know, but it's just so hard, you know? I mean, you're sitting
there with her, she has no idea what's happening, and then you finally get up the courage
to do it, and there's the horrible awkward moment when you've handed her the note."
16,Joey," Why do you have to break up with her? Be a man, just stop calling. "
17,Phoebe," You know, if you want, I'll do it with you."
18,Chandler," Oh, thanks, but I think she'd feel like we're gangin' up on her. "
19,Phoebe," No, I mean you break up with Janice and I'll break up with Tony. "
20,Ross, Tony?
21,Monica," Oh, you're breaking up with Tony?"
22,Phoebe," Yeah, I know, he's sweet, but it's just not fun anymore, you know? I
don't know if it's me, or his hunger strike, or, I don't know."
23,Rachel, (waitressing) Does anybody want anything else?
24,Ross," Oh, yeah, last week you had a wonderful, nutty, chocolatey kind of a cakey
pie thing. (Rachel gives him a dirty look) Nothing, just, just, I'm fine."
25,Phoebe, (to Rachel) What's the matter? Why so scrunchy?
26,Rachel, It's my father. He wants to give me a Mercedes convertible.
27,Ross," That guy, he burns me up."
28,Rachel," Yeah, well, it's a Mercedes if I move back home. Oh, it was horrible. He
called me young lady."
29,Chandler," Ooh, I hate when my father calls me that."
30,Monica," Did he give you that whole ""You're-not-up-to-this"" thing
again?"
31,Rachel," Oh, yeah, yeah. Actually, I got the extended disco version, with three
choruses of ""You'll never make it on your own""."
32,Phoebe," (rhythmically) Uh-huh, uh-huh."
35,Joey," My god, Angela."
37,Monica," Wow, being dumped by you obviously agrees with her."
38,Phoebe, Are you gonna go over there?
39,Joey," No, yeah, no, ok, but not yet. I don't wanna seem too eager. One
Mississippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi. That seems pretty cool. (he walks over to
her) Hey, Angela. "
41,Joey, You look good.
43,Joey, You don't say.
45,Ross," So, uh, Rachel, what are you, uh, what're you doing tonight?"
46,Rachel," Oh, big glamour night. Me and Monica at Laundorama."
47,Ross," Oh, you uh, you wanna hear a freaky coincidence? Guess who's doing laundry
there too?"
48,Rachel, Who?
49,Ross," Me. Was that not clear? Hey, why don't, um, why don't I just join you
both, here?"
50,Rachel, Don't you have a laundry room in your building?
51,Ross," Yes, I do have a laundry room in my building, um, but there's a.... rat
problem. Apparently they're attracted to the dryer sheets, and they're goin' in fine, but
they're comin' out all.... fluffy. Anyway, say, sevenish?"
52,Rachel, Sure.
55,Joey, Bob? Who the hell's Bob?
57,Joey," Come on, we were great together. And not just at the fun stuff, but like,
talking too."
59,Joey, What?
61,Joey," Fine, fine, so, why don't the four of us go out and have dinner together
tonight? You know, as friends?"
63,Joey," You know, you and Bob, and me and my girlfriend, uh, uh, Monica."
65,Joey," Monica, I'm tellin' you, this guy is perfect for you."
66,Monica, Forget it. Not after your cousin who could belch the alphabet.
67,Joey," Come on. This guy's great. His name's Bob. He's Angela's... brother. He's
smart, he's sophisticated, and he has a real job. Me, I go on three auditions a month and
call myself an actor, but Bob is..."
68,Monica," (looking out window) Oh, god help us."
69,Joey, What?
70,Monica, Ugly Naked Guy's laying kitchen tile. Eww!
71,Joey," Eww! Look, I'm asking a favor here. If I do this for her brother, maybe
Angela will come back to me."
72,Monica, What's going on here? You go out with tons of girls.
73,Joey," (proud) I know, but, I made a huge mistake. I never should have broken up
with her. Will you help me? Please?"
75,Ross," (on phone) Ok, bye. (hangs up) Well, Monica's not coming, it's just gonna
be me and Rachel."
76,Chandler," Oh. Well, hold on camper, are you sure you've thought this thing
through?"
77,Ross, It's laundry. The thinking through is minimal.
78,Chandler," It's just you and Rachel, just the two of you? This is a date. You're
going on a date."
79,Ross, Nuh-uh.
80,Chandler, Yuh-huh.
81,Ross," So what're you saying here? I should shave again, pick up some wine, what?"
82,Chandler," Well, you may wanna rethink the dirty underwear. This is basically the
first time she's gonna see your underwear—you want it to be dirty?"
83,Ross, (sheepish) No.
84,Chandler," Oh, and uh, the fabric softener?"
85,Ross," Ok, ok, now what is wrong with my Snuggles? What, it says I'm a
sensitive, warm kinda guy, you know, like a warm, fuzzy bear. Ok, I can pick something
else up on the way."
86,Chandler, There you go.
88,Monica, Thank you. So what does this Bob guy look like? Is he tall? Short?
89,Joey, Yep.
90,Monica, Which?
91,Joey, Which what?
92,Monica," You've never met Bob, have you?"
93,Joey," No, but he's..."
94,Monica," Oh my god, Joey, for all we know this guy could be horribly..."
97,Monica, ...horribly attractive. I'll be shutting up now.
99,Chandler, Where are they? Where are they?
100,Phoebe, This is nice. We never do anything just the two of us.
101,Chandler," It's great. Maybe tomorrow we can rent a car and run over some
puppies."
102,Phoebe," Eww, I don't wanna do that."
104,Chandler, Here we go.
105,Phoebe," Ok, have a good break-up."
106,Chandler," Hey, Janice."
108,Chandler," Hey, that's not good. Can I get an espresso and a latte over here,
please?"
111,Chandler, What?
113,Chandler, (covering) What... did you get me there? 
115,Chandler, Bullwinkle socks. That's so sweet.
117,Chandler, That's great. 
119,Chandler," Well, I'm gonna get another espresso. Can I get you another latte?"
122,Chandler, That's it?
123,Phoebe," Yeah, it was really hard."
124,Chandler," Oh, yeah, that hug looked pretty brutal."
125,Phoebe," Ok, you weren't there."
128,Rachel," Oh, 'scuse me. I was kinda using that machine."
130,Rachel, But I saved it. I put my basket on top.
132,Rachel, What?
135,Ross, What's goin' on?
136,Rachel," Hi, uh, nothing. That horrible woman just took my machine."
137,Ross, Was your basket on top?
138,Rachel," Yeah, but, there were no suds."
139,Ross, So?
140,Rachel," Well, you know, no suds, no save."
141,Ross," No suds? Excuse me, hold on a second. (to woman) That's my friend's
machine."
143,Ross," Hey, hey, hey, that's not the rule and you know it. "
145,Ross," (to the crowd in the laundromat) All right, show's over. Nothing to see
here. (to Rachel) Ok, let's do laundry."
146,Rachel, That was amazing. I can't even send back soup.
147,Ross," Well, that's because you're such a sweet, gentle, uh...Do you, uh, do
you...Oh, hey, uh you must need detergent."
149,Rachel, What's that?
150,Ross," Uberveiss. It's new, it's German, it's extra-tough."
152,Ross," Rach, do you uh, are you gonna separate those?"
153,Rachel," Oh god. Oh, am I being like a total laundry spaz? I mean, am I supposed
to use like one machine for shirts and another machine for pants? "
154,Ross," Rach, have you never done this before?"
155,Rachel," Well, not myself, but I know other people that have. Ok, you caught me.
I'm a laundry virgin."
156,Ross," Uh, well, don't worry, I'll use the gentle cycle. Ok, um, basically you
wanna use one machine for all your whites, a whole nother machine for colors, and a third
for your uh, your uh, delicates, and that would be your bras and your under-panty things."
157,Rachel," (holds a pair of panties in front of Ross) Ok, Well, what about these
are white cotton panties. Would they go with whites or delicates?"
158,Ross," (visibly nervous) Uh, that, that, that would be a judgment call."
160,Monica," (to Joey) He is so cute. (to Angela and Bob) So, where did you guys grow
up?"
163,Monica," How, how did that happen?"
164,Joey, Oh my god.
165,Monica, What?
166,Joey, I suddenly had the feeling that I was falling. But I'm not.
168,Joey," So, you and Angela, huh?"
170,Joey," You're a lucky man. You know what I miss the most about her? That cute
nibbly noise when she eats. Like a happy little squirrel, or a weasel."
172,Joey," Oh, yeah, yeah, listen for it."
174,Joey," Yeah, but it's not gonna last. She's too much for me in bed. Sexually."
176,Monica," I've gotta tell you, Bob is terrific."
178,Monica," It is so great to meet a guy who is smart and funny, and has an
emotional age beyond, like eight."
180,Monica, Wow. My brother never even told me when he lost his virginity.
183,Phoebe," Ok, you can do this. It's just like pulling off a Band-aid. Just do it
really fast, and then the wound is exposed."
185,Chandler," Janice. Hi, Janice. Ok, here we go. I don't think we should go out
anymore. Janice."
188,Rachel," Ok, I know this is gonna sound really stupid, but I feel that if I can
do this, you know, if I can actually do my own laundry, there isn't anything I can't do."
189,Ross," That does not sound stupid to me. You know, it's like the first time I had
to make dinner for myself, after Carol left me? (the buzzer on the washer goes off) I'm
sorry, that's all the time we have. Next on Ross...(opens up the washer) Uh-oh."
190,Rachel, What uh-oh?
191,Ross," (not wanting to tell her) Uh-oh, uh-oh, the laundry's done. It's, uh, it's
a song. The laundry song that we sing. (singing) Uh-oh the laundry's done, uh-oh, uh-oh."
192,Rachel," Ross, what's the matter?"
193,Ross," Nothing, nothing. Lee-lo, the laundry's done."
194,Rachel," Come on, show me."
195,Ross," All right, all right, it's just that you left a red sock in with all your
whites, and now, everything's kinda pink."
196,Rachel," Oh, everything's pink."
197,Ross," Yeah, uh, except for the red sock, which is still red. I'm sorry, please
don't be upset, it could happen to anyone."
198,Rachel," Except it didn't. It happened to me. Oh, god, I'm gonna look like a big
marshmallow peep. What am I doing? What am I doing? My father's right. I can't live on my
own! I can't even do laundry!"
201,Monica," Something went wrong with Underdog, and they couldn't get his head to
inflate. So anyway, um, his head is like flopping down Broadway, right, and I'm just
thinking... how inappropriate this is. Um, I've got something in my eye, uh, Joey, could
we check it in the light, please? "
203,Monica, Oh my god.
204,Joey, What?
205,Monica, Hello! Were we at the same table? It's like... cocktails in Appalachia.
206,Joey," Come on, they're close."
207,Monica, Close? She's got her tongue in his ear.
208,Joey," Oh, like you've never gotten a little rambunctious with Ross."
209,Monica," Joey, this is sick, it's disgusting, it's, it's—not really true, is
it?"
210,Joey," Well, who's to say what's true? I mean..."
211,Monica," Oh my god, what were you thinking?"
212,Joey," All right, look, I'm not proud of this, ok? Well, maybe I am a little."
213,Monica, (hits him lightly) Oh! 
214,Joey, Ow!
215,Monica, (leaving) I'm outta here.
216,Joey," Wait, wait, wait. You want him, I want her. He likes you."
217,Monica, Really?
218,Joey," Yeah. I'm thinking, if we put our heads together, between the two of us,
we can break them up."
220,Monica," I'm so sorry, I can't believe I did this, but I couldn't stop laughing
at your Norman Mailer story."
222,Joey," Uh, waiter, one more plate of chicken wings over here."
224,Chandler," Here's the thing, Janice. You know, I mean, it's like we're different.
I'm like the bing, bing, bing. You're like the boom, boom, (Chandler flails his hand out
and hits Janice in the eye)... boom."
226,Chandler," Oh, my god, I'm so sorry. Are you ok?"
229,Chandler," (to Phoebe) I hit her in the eye! I hit her in the eye! This is the
worst break-up in the history of the world. "
230,Phoebe," Oh my god. (Chandler downs another espresso.) How many of those have you
had?"
231,Chandler," Oh, I don't know, a million?"
232,Phoebe," Chandler, easy, easy. Go to your happy place. La la la la la la la."
233,Chandler, I'm fine.
234,Phoebe, All right. 
236,Chandler, I'm not fine. Here she comes.
237,Phoebe, Wait here. Breathe.
239,Chandler, How do you do that?
240,Phoebe, It's like a gift.
241,Chandler, We should always always break up together.
242,Phoebe," Oh, I'd like that."
244,Ross, You got the clothes clean. Now that's the important part.
245,Rachel," Oh, I guess. Except everything looks like jammies now."
247,Rachel," Whoa, I'm sorry. Excuse me. We had this cart."
250,Rachel," I'm sorry, you know, maybe I wasn't being clear. Uh, this is our cart."
252,Rachel," Hey, hey, hey, hey, quit making up rules!"
255,Rachel," All right, listen, missy. If you want this cart, you're gonna have to
take me with it! "
257,Rachel, (to Ross) Yes! Did you see that?
258,Ross," You were incredible! Brand new woman, ladies and gentlemen."
259,Rachel, I could not have done this without you.
261,Ross," Ok, um, uh, more clothes in the dryer? (Ross turns and bangs his head on
an open dryer door.) I'm fine, I'm fine."
262,Rachel, Are you sure?
263,Ross, No.
266,Rachel," Oh, are you sure you're ok?"
267,Ross, Yeah.
268,Rachel, Does it still hurt?
269,Ross, Yeah.
270,Phoebe," (seeing Rachel's clothes) What a neat idea. All your clothes match. I'm
gonna do this."
272,Monica, Hi.
273,Phoebe," Hey, how'd it go?"
274,Joey, Excellent.
275,Monica," We ripped that couple apart, and kept the pieces for ourselves."
276,Ross," What a beautiful story. Hey, I'm fine by the way."
277,Monica," (notices his head) Oh, I'm sorry."
278,Rachel, Where's Chandler?
279,Phoebe," Oh, he needed some time to grieve."
281,Chandler, I'm free! I'm free!
282,Phoebe, That oughta do it.
0,Rachel," (reading the program) Ooh! Look! Look! Look! Look, there's Joey's
picture! This is so exciting!"
1,Chandler," You can always spot someone who's never seen one of his plays before.
Notice, no fear, no sense of impending doom..."
2,Phoebe," The exclamation point in the title scares me. (Gesturing) Y'know, it's
not just Freud, it's Freud!"
4,Ross," Oh, shhh, shh. Magic is about to happen."
6,Joey," Vell, Eva, ve've done some excellent vork here, and I vould have to say,
your pwoblem is qviiite clear. (He goes into a song and dance number.) "
10,Rachel, God. I feel violated.
11,Monica," Did anybody else feel they just wanted to peel the skin off their body,
to have something else to do?"
12,Chandler," (staring at a woman across the room) Ross, ten o'clock."
13,Ross, Is it? Feels like two.
14,Chandler," No, ten o'clock."
15,Ross, What?
16,Chandler," (sighs and gestures to explain) There's a beautiful woman at eight,
nine, ten o'clock!"
17,Ross, Oh. Hel-lo!
18,Chandler," She's amazing! She makes the women that I dream about look like short,
fat, bald men!"
19,Monica," Well, go over to her! She's not with anyone."
20,Chandler," Oh yeah, and what would my opening line be? 'Excuse me.
Blarrglarrghh.'"
21,Rachel," Oh, c'mon. She's a person, you can do it!"
22,Chandler," Oh please, could she be more out of my league? Ross,
back me up here."
23,Ross, He could never get a woman like that in a million years.
24,Chandler," Thank you, buddy."
25,Phoebe," Oh, oh, but y'know, you always see these really beautiful women with
these really nothing guys, you could be one of those guys."
26,Monica, You could do that!
27,Chandler, Y'think?
29,Chandler," Oh God, I can't believe I'm even considering this... I'm very very
aware of my tongue..."
30,Ross, C'mon! C'mon!
31,Chandler, Here goes. (He walks over to her but just stands there.)
33,Chandler," Hi.... um... okay, next word... would be... Chandler! Chandler is my
name, and, uh...(He clears his throat noisily)...hi."
35,Chandler," Yes, yes I did, but what I didn't say was what I was about to say,
what I wanted to say was, uh... would you like to go out with me sometime, thankyou,
goodnight. (He walks back to the others but she calls him back.) "
39,Joey, Whadja think?
42,Joey," C'mon, you guys, it wasn't that bad. It was better than that thing I did
with the trolls, at least you got to see my head."
44,Chandler," (running back) She said yes!! She said yes!! (To Joey) Awful play,
man. Whoah. (To All) Her name's Aurora, and she's Italian, and she pronounces my name
'Chand-lrr'. 'Chand-lrr'. I think I like it better that way. (To Joey) Oh, listen, the
usher gave me this to give to you. (He fishes a card out of his pocket.)"
45,Rachel, What is it?
46,Joey," The Estelle Leonard Talent Agency. Wow, an agency left me its card! Maybe
they wanna sign me!"
47,Phoebe, Based on this play? ...Based on this play!
49,Chandler," Hey, kids. "
51,Phoebe," (reading Monica's palm) No, 'cause this line is passion, and this is...
just a line."
52,Chandler," Well, I can't believe I've been here almost seven seconds and you
haven't asked me how my date went."
53,Monica," Oh, right, right. How was your date, 'Chand-lrr'?"
54,Chandler," It was unbelievable. I-I've never met anyone like her. She's had the
most amazing life! She was in the Israeli army..."
57,Chandler," Alright. Once I got on the subway, right, and it was at night, and I
rode it all the way to Brooklyn... just for the hell of it."
60,Chandler," Oh, I'm sorry, so 'we' is?"
63,Chandler, Who's Rick?
66,Chandler," Oh, so you're divorced?"
68,Chandler," Oh, I'm sorry, then you're widowed?...Hopefully?"
70,Chandler," So tell me, how do- how do you think your husband would feel about you
sitting here with me?...Sliding your foot so far up my pant leg you can count the change
in my pocket?"
72,Chandler," Ethan? There's, there's an Ethan?"
75,Chandler," So explain something to me here, uh, what kind of a relationship do
you imagine us having if you already have a husband and a boyfriend?"
77,Chandler, ...Hm.
79,Chandler," What 'not work out'? I'm seeing her again on Thursday. Didn't you
listen to the story?"
80,Monica," Didn't you listen to the story? I mean, this is twisted! How could you
get involved with a woman like this?"
81,Chandler," Well, y'know, I had some trouble with it at first too, but the way I
look at it is, I get all the good stuff all the fun, all the talking, all the sex; and none
of the responsibility. I mean, this is every guy's fantasy!"
82,Phoebe," Oh, yeah. That is not true. Ross, is this your fantasy?"
83,Ross," No, of course not! (Thinks) ...Yeah, yeah, it is."
84,Monica," What? So you guys don't mind going out with someone else who's going out
with someone else?"
85,Joey, I couldn't do it.
86,Monica," Good for you, Joey."
87,Joey," When I'm with a woman, I need to know that I'm going out with
more people than she is."
88,Ross," Well, y'know, monogamy can be a, uh, tricky concept. I mean,
anthropologically speaking-"
90,Ross," Fine. Fine, alright, now you'll never know."
91,Monica," We're kidding. C'mon, tell us!"
93,Ross," Alright. There's a theory, put forth by Richard Leakey-"
96,Rachel, Tah-daaah!
97,Chandler, Are we greeting each other this way now? 'Cause I like that.
98,Rachel," Look! I cleaned! I did the windows, I did the floors... I even used all
the attachments on the vacuum, except that little round one with the bristles, I don't
know what that's for."
99,Ross," Oh yeah, nobody knows. And we're not supposed to ask."
100,Rachel," Well, whaddya think?"
102,Monica, ...Oh! I-I see you moved the green ottoman.
104,Monica, How-how did that happen?
105,Rachel," I dunno.. I-I thought it looked better there. And I- and also, it's an
extra seat around the coffee table."
106,Monica," Yeah, yeah, it's interesting.. but y'know what? Just for fun, let's see
what it looked like in the old spot. (She moves it.) Alright, just to compare. Let's see.
Well, it looks good there too. Let's just leave it there for a while."
107,Phoebe, (to Rachel) I can't believe you tried to move the green ottoman.
108,Chandler," Thank God you didn't try to fan out the magazines. I mean, she'll
scratch your eyes right out."
109,Monica," You guys, I am not that bad!"
110,Phoebe," Yeah, you are, Monica. Remember when I lived with you? You were like, a
little, y'know, (psycho) Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree!"
111,Monica, That is so unfair!
112,Ross," Oh c'mon! When we were kids, yours was the only Raggedy Ann doll that
wasn't raggedy!"
113,Monica," Okay, so I'm responsible, I'm organised. But hey, I can be a kook."
114,Ross," Alright, you madcap gal. Try to imagine this. The phone bill arrives, but
you don't pay it right away."
115,Monica, Why not?
116,Ross, Because you're a kook! Instead you wait until they send you a notice.
117,Monica, I could do that.
118,Rachel," Okay, uh, you let me go grocery shopping, and I buy laundry detergent,
but it's not the one with the easy-pour spout."
119,Monica, Why would someone do that?! ...One might wonder.
120,Chandler," Someone's left a glass on the coffee table. There's no coaster. It's a
cold drink, it's a hot day. Little beads of condensation are inching their way closer and
closer to the surface of the wood..."
121,Monica, STOP IT!! ...Oh my God. It's true! Who am I?
122,Ross, Monica? You're Mom.
124,Phoebe, Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree!
126,Joey," (on phone) Uh huh.. uh huh... oh my God! Okay! Okay, I'll be there! (He
hangs up and to all.) That was my agent. (He tosses and catches the phone.) My agent has
just gotten me a job...in the new Al Pacino movie!"
128,Monica," Well, what's the part?"
129,Joey," Can you believe this? Al Pacino! This guy's the reason I became an actor!
""I'm out of order? Pfeeeh. You're out of order! This whole courtroom's out of
order!"""
130,Phoebe," Seriously, what-what's the part?"
131,Joey," ""Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in!"""
132,Ross," C'mon, seriously, Joey, what's the part?"
133,Joey, ...I'm his (mumbles)
134,Rachel," ..You're, you're 'mah mah mah' what?"
135,Joey," ...I'm his butt double. 'Kay? I play Al Pacino's butt. Alright? He goes
into the shower, and then- I'm his butt."
136,Monica, (trying not to laugh) Oh my God.
137,Joey," C'mon, you guys. This is a real movie, and Al Pacino's in it, and that's
big!"
138,Chandler," Oh no, it's terrific, it's... it's... y'know, you deserve this, after
all your years of struggling, you've finally been able to crack your way into
showbusiness."
139,Joey," Okay, okay, fine! Make jokes, I don't care! This is a big break for me!"
140,Ross," You're right, you're right, it is...So you gonna invite us all to the big
opening?"
143,Monica," Alright, alright, alright... "
145,Joey, Here. I need to borrow some moisturizer.
146,Monica, For what?
147,Joey, Whaddya think? Today's the big day!
148,Monica," Oh my God. Okay, go into the bathroom, use whatever you want, just don't
ever tell me what you did in there."
149,Joey, Thank you! (He goes into the bathroom.)
151,Chandler, Where's Joey? His mom's on the phone.
152,Monica, He's in the bathroom. I don't think you wanna go in there!
153,Chandler," C'mon, we're roommates! (He goes into the bathroom, screams, and runs
back out.) My eyes!! My eyes!!"
154,Monica, I warned you...
156,Rachel, Who is being loud?
157,Chandler," Oh, that would be Monica. Hey, listen, I wanna borrow a coupla things,
Aurora spent the night, I really wanna make her breakfast."
158,Monica," Oh, you got the whole night, huh?"
159,Chandler," Yeah, well, I only have twenty minutes until Ethan, so, y'know.. (He
starts to raid the fridge.)"
160,Rachel," Ooh, do I sense a little bit of resentment?"
161,Chandler," No, no resentment, believe me, it's worth it. 'Kay? Y'know in a
relationship you have these key moments that you know you'll remember for the rest of your
life? Well, every- single- second is like that with Aurora.. and I've just wasted about
thirty-five of them talking to you people, so, uh.. Monica, can you help me with the door?
(He has armloads of stuff.)"
162,Monica," Sure. Oh, um, Chandler? Y'know, the-the old Monica would-would remind
you to scrub that Teflon pan with a plastic brush...But I'm not gonna do that. "
166,Joey," Uh, listen, I just wanna thank you for this great opportunity."
168,Joey, Me?
170,Joey," Right. Okay. Losing the robe. (He takes off the robe.) And the robe is
lost."
174,Joey," Well, I'm- I'm showering."
176,Joey," Oh. Well, the way I see it, the guy's upset here, y'know? I mean, his
wife's dead, his brother's missing... I think his butt would be angry here."
178,Joey, I was going for quiet desperation. But if you have to ask...
180,Chandler," God, I love these fingers..."
182,Chandler," No, actually I meant my fingers. Look at 'em, look at how happy they
are."
184,Chandler," Oh no nonononononnononono, don't go.. (He kisses her and pulls her
back down.)"
186,Chandler, Don't go.
188,Chandler," (to himself) Too bad, she's leaving."
190,Chandler," Well, I thought- I thought you talked to Rick."
192,Chandler," What, Ethan? He got to spend the whole day with you!"
194,Chandler," I know there'll be many moments in the years to come when I'll regret
asking the following question, but- And Andrew is?"
196,Chandler," Oh, so what you're saying is you're not completely fulfilled by Rick,
Ethan and myself?"
198,Chandler," Well, y'know, most women would kill for three guys like us."
200,Chandler, You.
202,Chandler," Nono, just you."
204,Chandler, Lose the other guys.
206,Chandler," C'mon, we're great together, why not?"
208,Chandler," ...Well, y'know, part of me wants that, but it's like I'm two guys,
y'know? I mean, one guy's going 'Shut up! This is great!' But there's this other guy.
Actually it's the same guy that wells up every time that Grinch's heart grows three sizes
and breaks that measuring device... And he's saying, y'know, 'This is too hard! Get out!
Get out!'"
210,Chandler," I don't know, I-I have to listen to both of them, they don't exactly
let each other finish..."
212,Chandler, ...The second guy.
215,Chandler," Sorry, the first guy runs the lips."
218,Ross," Look at it this way you dumped her.
Right? I mean, this woman was unbelievably sexy, and beautiful, intelligent,
unattainable... Tell me why you did this again?"
221,Monica," Hey, waitwait, aren't you the guy that plays the butt in the new Al
Pacino movie?"
222,Joey, Nope.
223,Ross," No? What happened, big guy?"
224,Chandler," (to Ross) ""Big guy?"""
225,Ross, It felt like a 'big guy' moment.
226,Joey, I got fired.
228,Joey," Yeah, they said I acted too much with it. I told everybody about this! Now
everybody's gonna go to the theatre, expecting to see me, and..."
229,Rachel," Oh, Joey, you know what, no-one is gonna be able to tell."
230,Joey, My mom will.
231,Chandler, Something so sweet and...disturbing about that.
232,Joey," Y'know, I've done nothing but crappy plays for six years. And I finally
get my shot, and I blow it!"
233,Monica, Maybe this wasn't your shot.
234,Ross," Yeah, I mean... I think when it's your shot, y'know, you-you know it's
your shot. Did it... feel like your shot..?"
235,Joey," Hard to tell, I was naked."
236,Phoebe," No, I don't think this was your shot. I mean, I don't even think you
just get one shot. I really believe big things are gonna happen for you, I do! You've
gotta just keep thinking about the day that some kid is gonna run up to his friends and go
'I got the part! I got the part! I'm gonna be Joey Tribbiani's ass!'."
237,Joey, Yeah? That's so nice! (They hug.)
239,Monica," I'm sorry, Joey. I'm gonna go to bed, guys. "
241,Rachel," Uh, Mon, you-you gonna leave your shoes out here?"
242,Monica, (determined) Uh-huh!
243,Rachel, Really? Just casually strewn about in that reckless haphazard manner?
244,Monica," Doesn't matter, I'll get 'em tomorrow. Or not. Whenever. (He goes to her
room.)"
245,Ross, She is a kook.
248,Monica," (hums for a while, then gives up, and in her head) If it bothers you
that much, just go out and get the shoes. No. Don't do this. This is stupid! I don't have
to prove anything, I'm gonna go get them...But then everyone will know. Unless I get them,
and then wake up really early and put them back! ...I need help! (She buries her head
in her pillow.) "
0,Rachel," Everybody? Shh, shhh. Uhhh... Central Perk is proud to present the music
of Miss Phoebe Buffay."
2,Phoebe," Hi. Um, I want to start with a song thats about that moment when you
suddenly realize what life is all about. OK, here we go. (plays a chord, then the lights
go out) OK, thank you very much."
4,Chandler," Oh, great. This is just..."
7,Rachel," Wow, this is so cool, you guys. The entire city is blacked out!"
8,Monica," Mom says it's all of Manhattan, parts of Brooklyn and Queens, and they
have no idea when it's coming back on."
9,Rachel," Wow, you guys, this is big."
10,Monica," (into phone) Pants and a sweater? Why, mom? Who am I gonna meet in a
blackout? Power company guys? Eligible looters? Could we talk about this later? OK. (hangs
up)"
11,Phoebe," Can I borrow the phone? I want to call my apartment and check on my
grandma. (to Monica) What's my number? "
13,Phoebe," Well, I never call me."
15,Chandler," Oh my God, it's that Victoria's Secret model. Something...
something Goodacre."
17,Chandler," She's right, it's Jill. Jill Goodacre. Oh my God. I am trapped in
an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre! (pause) Is it a vestibule? Maybe it's an
atrium. Oh, yeah, that is the part to focus on, you idiot!"
19,Chandler, Jill says vestibule... I'm going with vestibule.
21,Chandler," Oh! Some guy. Some guy. 'Hey Jill, I saw you with some guy last
night. Yes, he was some guy. "
24,Joey, Hi everyone.
25,Ross," And officiating at tonight's blackout, is Rabbi Tribbiani."
26,Joey," Well, Chandler's old roomate was Jewish, and these are the only candles we
have, so... Happy Chanukah, everyone."
27,Phoebe," (at window) Eww, look. Ugly Naked Guy lit a bunch of candles."
29,Rachel, That had to hurt!
31,Chandler," Alright, alright, alright. It's been fourteen and a half minutes
and you still have not said one word. Oh God, do something. Just make contact, smile!"
33,Chandler, There you go!
35,Chandler, You're definitely scaring here.
37,Chandler," Yeah, about 300 guys I went to high school with. Yeah, thanks.
(takes phone)"
39,Monica, Hello?
40,Chandler," Hey, it's me."
41,Monica, (to everyone) It's Chandler! (on phone) Are you OK?
42,Chandler," Yeah, I'm fine. (trying to cover up what he is saying) I'm trppd in an
ATM vstbl wth Jll Gdcr."
43,Monica, What?
44,Chandler, I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth Jll Gdcr!
45,Monica, I have no idea what you just said.
46,Chandler, (angry) Put Joey on the phone.
47,Joey, What's up man?
48,Chandler, I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth JLL GDCR.
49,Joey," (to everyone) Oh my God! He's trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill
Goodacre! (on phone) Chandler, listen. (says something intentionally garbled)"
50,Chandler," Yeah, like that thought never entered my mind."
52,Rachel," Alright, somebody."
53,Monica," OK, I'll go. OK, senior year of college... on a pool table."
55,Ross, That's my sister.
56,Joey," OK... my weirdest place would have to be... the women's room on the second
floor of the New York CIty public library."
57,Monica, Oh my God! What were you doing in a library?
58,Ross," Pheebs, what about you?"
59,Phoebe, Oh... Milwaukee.
60,Rachel, Um... Ross?
61,Ross," Disneyland, 1989, 'It's a Small World After All.'"
63,Ross," The ride broke down. So, Carol and I went behind a couple of those
mechanical Dutch children... then they fixed the ride, and we were asked never to return
to the Magic Kingdom."
64,Phoebe," Oh, Rachel."
65,Rachel," Oh come on, I already went."
66,Monica, You did not go!
68,Rachel," Oh, alright. The weirdest place would have to be... (sigh)... oh, the
foot of the bed. "
69,Ross, Step back.
70,Joey, We have a winner!
72,Rachel," I just never had a relationship with that kind of passion, you know,
where you have to have somebody right there, in the middle of a theme park."
73,Ross," Well, it was the only thing to do there that didn't have a line."
74,Rachel," There, well, see? Barry wouldn't even kiss me on a miniature golf
course. "
75,Ross, Come on.
76,Rachel," No, he said we were holding up the people behind us."
77,Ross, (sarcastically) And you didn't marry him because...?
78,Rachel," I mean, do you think there are people who go through life never having
that kind of..."
79,Ross," Probably. But you know, I'll tell you something. Passion is way overrated.
"
80,Rachel, Yeah right.
81,Ross," It is. Eventually, it kind of... burns out. But hopefully, what you're
left with is trust, and security, and... well, in the case of my ex-wife, lesbianism. So,
you know, for all of those people who miss out on that passion... thing, there's all that
other good stuff."
82,Rachel, (sigh) OK.
83,Ross," But, um... I don't think that's going to be you."
84,Rachel, You don't.
85,Ross," Uh-uh. See, I see.... big passion in your future."
86,Rachel, Really?
87,Ross, Mmmm.
88,Rachel, You do?
89,Ross, I do.
90,Rachel," Oh Ross, you're so great. (she playfully rubs his head and gets up)"
92,Joey, It's never gonna happen.
93,Ross, (innocently) What?
94,Joey, You and Rachel.
95,Ross, (acts surprised) What? (pause) Why not?
96,Joey," Because you waited too long to make your move, and now you're in the friend
zone. "
97,Ross," No, no, no. I'm not in the zone."
98,Joey," Ross, you're mayor of the zone."
99,Ross," I'm taking my time, alright? I'm laying the groundwork. Yeah. I mean,
every day I get just a little bit closer to..."
100,Joey," Priesthood! Look Ross, I'm telling you, she has no idea what you're
thinking. If you don't ask her out soon you're going to end up stuck in the zone forever."
101,Ross," I will, I will. See, I'm waiting for the right moment. (Joey looks at him)
What? What, now?"
102,Joey," Yeeeeaaaahhh! What's messing you up? The wine? The candles? The moonlight?
You've just got to go up to her and say, 'Rachel, I think that...' (Rachel comes into the
room behind them)"
103,Ross, Shhhh!
104,Rachel, What are you shushing?
105,Ross," We're shushing... because... we're trying to hear something. Listen.
(everyone is silent) Don't you hear that?"
106,Rachel, Ahhhh!
107,Ross, See?
108,Rachel," Huh. (she agrees, but looks very confused)"
111,Chandler," Um, is it sugarless?"
113,Chandler," Oh, then no thanks. What the hell was that? Mental note If Jill
Goodacre offers you gum, you take it. If she offers you mangled animal carcass, you take
it."
115,Phoebe," (singing) New York City has no power, and the milk is getting sour. But
to me it is not scary, 'cause I stay away from dairy.... la la la, la la, la la... (she
writes the lyrics down)"
116,Ross," (to Joey) OK, here goes."
117,Joey, Are you going to do it?
118,Ross, I'm going to do it.
119,Joey, Do you want any help?
120,Ross," You come out there, you're a dead man."
121,Joey," Good luck, man."
122,Ross, Thanks. (Joey hugs him) OK.
123,Joey, OK. (Ross goes out on the balcony to talk to Rachel)
125,Joey," Hey, where are you going?"
126,Monica, Outside.
127,Joey, You can't go out there.
128,Monica, Why not?
129,Joey, Because of... the reason.
130,Monica, And that would be?
131,Joey," I, um, can't tell you."
132,Monica," Joey, what's going on?"
133,Joey," OK, you've got to promise that you'll never, ever tell Ross that I told
you."
134,Monica, About what?
135,Joey, He's planning your birthday party.
136,Monica, Oh my God! I love him!
137,Joey, (as Phoebe enters) You'd better act surprised.
138,Phoebe, About what?
139,Monica, My surprise party!
140,Phoebe, What surprise party?
141,Monica, Oh stop it. Joey already told me.
142,Phoebe," Well, he didn't tell me."
143,Joey," Hey, don't look at me. This is Ross's thing."
144,Phoebe, This is so typical. I'm always the last one to know everything.
145,Monica," No, you are not. We tell you stuff."
146,Phoebe," Yuh-huh! I was the last one to know when Chandler got bitten by the
peacock at the zoo. I was the last one to know when you had a crush on Joey when he was
moving in. (Monica gestures at Phoebe to shut up; Joey looks surprised but pleased) Looks
like I was second to last."
148,Rachel, Hmmm... this is so nice.
149,Ross," OK, I have a question. Well, actually, it's not so much a question as..
more of a general wondering... ment."
150,Rachel, OK.
151,Ross," OK. Here goes. For a while now, I've been wanting to, um...."
152,Rachel, Ohhh!!!! (looking at something behind Ross)
153,Ross," Yes, yes, that's right..."
154,Rachel," Oh, look at the little cat! (a small kitten is on the roof behind Ross)"
155,Ross, What? (the cat jumps on his shoulders) Ow!
159,Monica, (to Ross) This is just Bactine. It won't hurt.
161,Joey," Sorry, that was wax."
162,Phoebe," Oh, poor little Tooty is scared to death. We should find his owner."
163,Ross, Why don't we just put 'poor little Tooty' out in the hall?
164,Rachel, During a blackout? He'd get trampled!
165,Ross, (nonchalantly) Yeah?
167,Chandler," You know, on second thought, gum would be perfection. (Jill gives him
a stick of gum, and a strange look) 'Gum would be perfection'? 'Gum would be
perfection.' Could have said 'gum would be nice,' or 'I'll have a stick,' but no, no, no,
no. For me, gum is perfection. I loathe myself."
169,Phoebe," (stops at a door) Oh no, the Mendels, they hate all living things,
right?"
170,Rachel," Oh. (they knock at the next door, Mr. Heckles answers) Hi. We just found
this cat and we're looking for the owner."
172,Phoebe," (trying to hold back the struggling cat) He seems to hate you. Are you
sure?"
174,Phoebe, Wait a minute. What's his name?
176,Rachel, Bob Buttons?
178,Phoebe, (the cat runs away from her) Oooh! You are a very bad man!
181,Rachel," Here, kitty-kitty. Here kitty-kitty. Where did you go, little
kitty-kitty-kitty? Here kitty-kitty-kitty-kitty..."
184,Rachel," Wow. (she exhales in amazement, blowing the candle out)"
186,Ross, (rolling) Lucky sixes....
187,Rachel," (entering with Paolo, arm in arm) Everybody, this is Paolo. Paolo, I
want you to meet my friends. This is Monica."
188,Monica, (smitten) Hi!
189,Rachel, And Joey....
190,Monica, Hi!
191,Rachel, And Ross.
192,Monica, Hi!
194,Rachel, (proudly) He doesn't speak much English.
196,Rachel, Look at that!
197,Ross," (jealous) So, um... where did Paolo come from?"
198,Rachel," Oh... Italy, I think."
199,Ross," No, I mean tonight, in the building. Suddenly. Into our lives."
200,Rachel," Well, the cat... the cat turned out to be Paolo's cat!"
201,Ross," That, that is funny... (to Joey).... and Rachel keeps touching him."
203,Phoebe," Alright. I looked all over the building and I couldn't find the kitty
anywhere."
204,Rachel," Oh, I found him. He was Paolo's cat."
205,Phoebe," Ah! Well! There you go! Last to know again! And I'm guessing... since
nobody told me... this is Paolo."
206,Rachel," Ah, Paolo, this is Phoebe."
208,Phoebe, (smiling) You betcha!
210,Chandler," (chewing gum) Ah, let's see. What next? Blow a bubble. A bubble's
good. It's got a... boyish charm, it's impish. Here we go."
212,Chandler," Nice going, imp. OK, it's OK. All I need to do is reach over and
put it in my mouth. (Chandler slyly grabs the gum from the wall and slides it back in
his mouth.)"
213,Chandler," Good save! We're back on track, and I'm... (grimacing) ..chewing
someone else's gum. This is not my gum. Oh my God! Oh my God! And now you're
choking. "
218,Chandler, (gasping) Yes... thank you. That was... that was....
222,Ross," (mocking Paolo) Blah blah blah, blah blah blah... blah blaaaaaah...."
224,Ross, Wha-What did he say that was so funny?
225,Rachel, I have absolutely no idea.
226,Ross, That's... that's classic.
227,Rachel," (to Monica and Phoebe) Oh my God, you guys, what am I doing? What am I
doing? This is so un-me!"
228,Monica," If you want, I'll do it."
230,Phoebe," I know, I just want to bite his bottom lip. (Rachel looks at her) But I
won't."
231,Rachel," God, the first time he smiled at me... those three seconds were more
exciting than three weeks in Bermuda with Barry."
232,Phoebe," You know, did you ride mopeds? 'Cause I've heard... (they stare at
her)... oh, I see... it's not about that right now. OK."
233,Rachel," Y'know, I know it's totally superficial and we have absolutely nothing
in common, and we don't even speak the same language but Goooooooddddddd...."
235,Ross, Paolo. Hi.
238,Ross," Listen. Um, listen. Something you should... know... um, Rachel and I...
we're kind of a thing."
240,Ross," Thing, yes. Thing."
242,Ross," No, no, no. Technically the... sex is not... being had, but that's... see,
that's not the point. See, um, the point is that... Rachel and I should be, er, together.
You know, and if you get in the.... um... "
244,Ross," No, no, that's not where I was going. Er, if you get in the... way,
of us becoming a thing, then I would be, well, very sad."
246,Ross, Yeah! Se vice?
248,Ross, So you do know a little English.
250,Ross, Do you know the word crapweasel?
252,Ross," That's funny, because you know, you are a huge crapweasel!"
256,Chandler, OK.
262,Phoebe," Oh, look look look. The last candle's about to burn out. 10, 9, 8, 7...
(time lapse)... negative 46, negative 47, negative 48.... (someone blows it out, the room
gets completely dark)"
263,Ross, Thank you.
264,Phoebe, Thanks.
265,Ross, Kinda... spooky without any lights.
266,Joey, (does a maniacal laugh) Bwah-hah-hah!
268,Ross," OK, guys, guys? I have the definitive one. Mwwwooooo-hah-hah..."
270,Ross, Oh.. oh... oh.
271,Joey," Hey Ross. This probably isn't the best time to bring it up, but you have
to throw a party for Monica."
274,Chandler," Yes. Yes, thanks for letting me use your phone... and for saving my
life."
277,Chandler," Hi, um, I'm account number 7143457. And, uh, I don't know if you got
any of that, but I would really like a copy of the tape."
0,Chandler," Dehydrated Japanese noodles under fluorescent lights... does it get
better than this?"
2,Chandler," Ah, y'see, perfect might be a problem. Had you said 'co-dependent', or
'self-destructive'..."
4,Chandler, Yes please.
6,Chandler, He's a he?
10,Chandler," ...Couldn't enjoy a cup of noodles after that. I mean, is that
ridiculous? Can you believe she actually thought that?"
11,Rachel," Um... yeah. Well, I mean, when I first met you, y'know, I thought maybe,
possibly, you might be... "
12,Chandler, You did?
13,Rachel," Yeah, but then you spent Phoebe's entire birthday party talking to my
breasts, so then I figured maybe not."
14,Chandler," Huh. Did, uh... any of the rest of you guys think that when you first
met me?"
15,Monica, I did.
16,Phoebe," Yeah, I think so, yeah."
17,Joey, Not me.
18,Ross," Nono, me neither. Although, uh, y'know, back in college, Susan Sallidor
did."
19,Chandler, You're kidding! Did you tell her I wasn't?
20,Ross," No. No, it's just 'cause, uh, I kinda wanted to go out with her too, so I
told her, actually, you were seeing Bernie Spellman... who also liked her, so..."
22,Chandler," Well, this is fascinating. So, uh, what is it about me?"
23,Phoebe," I dunno, 'cause you're smart, you're funny..."
24,Chandler," Ross is smart and funny, d'you ever think that about him?"
26,Chandler, WHAT IS IT?!
27,Monica," Okay, I-I d'know, you-you just- you have a quality."
29,Chandler," Oh, oh, a quality, good, because I was worried you guys were gonna be
vague about this."
31,Monica," Hello? Hello? Oh! Rachel, it's Paolo calling from Rome. "
32,Rachel," Oh my God! Calling from Rome! (Takes phone) Bon giorno, caro mio.
"
33,Ross," (to Joey) So he's calling from Rome. I could do that. Just gotta go to
Rome."
34,Rachel," Monica, your dad just beeped in, but can you make it quick? Talking to
Rome. (Showing off to Phoebe and Chandler) I'm talking to Rome."
35,Monica," Hey dad, what's up? (Listens) Oh God. Ross, it's Nana."
37,Ross," So, uh, how's she doing?"
39,Monica," How-how are you, Mom?"
41,Monica, What?
43,Monica, Nothing.
46,Monica," She is unbelievable, our mother is..."
47,Ross," Okay, relax, relax. We are gonna be here for a while, it looks like, and
we still have boyfriends and your career to cover."
48,Monica, Oh God!
51,Monica, The fuzzy little mints at the bottom of her purse. 
52,Ross," Oh! ...Yeah, they were gross. Oh, you know what I loved? Her Sweet 'n'
Los. How she was always stealing them from- from restaurants."
57,Ross, She looks so small. 
58,Monica, I know.
59,Ross," Well, at least she's with Pop-Pop and Aunt Phyllis now. "
60,Monica," G'bye, Nana. (She kisses her on the forehead.)"
61,Ross," Bye, Nana. "
63,Monica, Ross!
66,Ross," Y'know how-how the nurse said that-that Nana had passed? Well, she's not,
quite.."
68,Ross," She's not- past, she's present, she's back."
74,Ross," I, uh, I'll go see. (He goes in)"
77,Ross, Now she's passed.
79,Chandler," I just have to know, okay. Is it my hair?"
80,Rachel," (exasperated) Yes, Chandler, that's exactly what it is. It's your hair."
81,Phoebe," Yeah, you have homosexual hair."
83,Rachel," So, um, did she..."
84,Ross, Twice.
85,Joey, Twice?
86,Phoebe," Oh, that sucks!"
87,Joey, You guys okay?
88,Ross," I dunno, it's weird. I mean, I know she's gone, but I just don't feel,
uh..."
89,Phoebe, Maybe that's 'cause she's not really gone.
90,Ross," Nono, she's gone."
91,Monica, We checked. A lot.
92,Phoebe," Hm, I mean maybe no-one ever really goes. Ever since my mom died, every
now and then, I get the feeling that she's like right here, y'know? (She circles her hand
around her right shoulder. Chandler, sitting on her right, draws back nervously) Oh! And
Debbie, my best friend from junior high- got struck by lightning on a miniature golf
course- I always get this really strong Debbie vibe whenever I use one of those little
yellow pencils, y'know? ...I miss her."
93,Rachel," Aw. Hey, Pheebs, want this? (Gives her a pencil)"
94,Phoebe, Thanks!
95,Rachel, Sure. I just sharpened her this morning.
96,Joey," Now, see, I don't believe any of that. I think once you're dead, you're
dead! You're gone! You're worm food! (realises his tactlessness) ...So Chandler looks gay,
huh?"
97,Phoebe," Y'know, I dunno who this is, but it's not Debbie. (Hands back the
pencil)"
99,Ross, I thought it was gonna be a closed casket.
103,Ross, (sarcastic) I don't see why not.
105,Ross, Here's my retainer!
108,Monica, Dad!
110,Monica, You what?
112,Monica, Define fun.
114,Monica," ...And then we throw your body in the water... Gee, that does sound fun."
116,Monica, That's probably what they'll say.
119,Chandler," Hey, gorgeous."
121,Chandler," No, nono, don't- don't worry about it. Believe me, apparently other
people have made the same mistake."
123,Chandler," So, uh... what do you think it is about me?"
125,Chandler," ...Quality, right, great."
127,Chandler," Lowell? Financial Services' Lowell, that's who you saw me with?"
129,Chandler," Well, yeah... 's'no Brian in Payroll."
131,Chandler," No! Uh, I d'know! The point is, if you were gonna set me up with
someone, I'd like to think you'd set me up with someone like him."
133,Chandler," Excuse me? You don't think I could get a Brian? Because I could get
a Brian. Believe you me. ...I'm really not."
135,Ross, (holding a dress out from inside the closet) This one?
137,Ross," I have shown you everything we have. Unless you want your mother to spend
eternity in a lemon yellow pant-suit, go with the burgundy."
140,Ross, Oh! A fine choice. I'm coming out. (Starts to climb over the furniture)
143,Ross," Okay. Um, how about these? (Holds out a pair)"
145,Ross, And where she's going everyone else'll be dressier?
147,Ross," (forages around) Okay, I have nothing in an evening shoe in the burgundy.
I can show you something in a silver that may work."
150,Ross," No! Nonono, wait a sec. I may have something in the back."
152,Ross, Oh my God..
154,Ross," Yeah, just... just Nana stuff."
158,Ross," (entering) How we doing, you guys ready?"
159,Monica," Mom already called this morning to remind me not to wear my hair up. Did
you know my ears are not my best feature?"
160,Ross, Some days it's all I can think about. 
161,Phoebe," (entering) Hi, sorry I'm late, I couldn't find my bearings."
162,Rachel," Oh, you-you mean your earrings?"
163,Phoebe, What'd I say?
164,Rachel, (sticking her foot out) Hm-m.
165,Monica, Are these the shoes?
166,Rachel, Yes. Paolo sent them from Italy.
167,Ross," What, we-uh- we don't have shoes here, or...?"
168,Joey, (entering with Chandler) Morning. We ready to go?
169,Chandler," Well, don't we look nice all dressed up?...It's stuff like that, isn't
it?"
172,Monica, It was a really beautiful service.
175,Joey, What?
176,Chandler," Nothing, just your overcoat sounds remarkably like Brent Mussberger."
177,Joey," Check it out, Giants-Cowboys. (He has a pocket TV)"
178,Chandler, You're watching a football game at a funeral?
179,Joey," No, it's the pre-game. I'm gonna watch it at the reception."
180,Chandler," You are a frightening, frightening man."
182,Rachel, Oh no! My new Paolo shoes!
183,Ross," Oh, I hope they're not ruined."
184,Phoebe," God, what a great day. ...What? Weather-wise!"
185,Ross," I know, uh, the air, the-the trees... even though Nana's gone there's,
there's something almost, uh- I dunno, almost life-aff- (Not looking where he is going he
falls into an open grave)"
187,Ross, I'm fine. Just-just... having my worst fear realised...
189,Phoebe," Okay, don't worry, I'm just checking to see if the muscle's in
spasm...huh."
190,Ross," What, what is it?"
191,Phoebe, You missed a belt loop. 
192,Ross, Oh! No-n-
193,Phoebe," Okay, it's in spasm."
196,Chandler," Oh, no-"
198,Chandler," Hi, I'm Chandler, and I have no idea who Dorothy is."
200,Phoebe," Hey, look who's up! How do you feel?"
201,Ross," I feel great. I feel- great, I fleel great."
202,Monica," Wow, those pills really worked, huh?"
203,Ross," Not the first two, but the second two- woooo! ...I love you guys. You guys
are the greatest. I love my sister (Kisses Monica), I love Pheebs... (Hugs her)"
204,Phoebe, Ooh! That's so nice...
205,Ross, ...Chandler! 
206,Chandler, Hey.
207,Ross," (hugs him) And listen, man, if you wanna be gay, be gay. Doesn't matter to
me."
209,Ross, Rachel. Rachel Rachel. (Sits down beside her) I love you the most.
210,Rachel," (humouring him) Oh, well you know who I love the most?"
211,Ross, No.
212,Rachel, You!
213,Ross, Oh.. you don't get it! (Passes out and slumps across her)
216,Joey," (hides the TV, but he still has an earphone) Just a, uh... hearing
disability."
218,Joey, Seventeen-fourteen Giants... three minutes to go in the third.
221,Rachel," (still trapped under Ross) Pheebs, could you maybe hand me a cracker?"
223,Monica," Well, sure, what with it being her funeral and all."
225,Monica, That sounds like Nana.
227,Monica, ...I can imagine.
229,Monica," That is a wonder. So tell me something, Mom. If you had to do it all
over again, I mean, if she was here right now, would you tell her?"
231,Monica," How she drove you crazy, picking on every little detail, like your
hair... for example."
233,Monica," Do you think things would have been better if you'd just told her the
truth?"
235,Monica, Huh.
237,Monica," Oh, I think so."
239,Monica, Thank you. They're yours.
244,Rachel," Hey, who's this little naked guy?"
245,Ross, That little naked guy would be me.
246,Rachel," Aww, look at the little thing."
247,Ross," Yes, yes, fine, that is my penis. Can we be grown-ups now?"
248,Chandler, Who are those people?
249,Ross, Got me.
250,Monica," Oh, that's Nana, right there in the middle. (Reads the back) 'Me and the
gang at Java Joe's'. "
251,Rachel," Wow, Monica, you look just like your grandmother. How old was she there?"
252,Monica," Let's see, 1939... yeah, 24, 25?"
253,Ross, Looks like a fun gang. (They all look at each other and smile)
254,Joey," Ooh, look-look-look-look-look! I got Monica naked!"
255,Ross," (looking) Nono, that would be me again. I'm, uh, just trying something."
258,Chandler," Hey, Lowell."
260,Chandler, So how's it going there in Financial Services?
262,Chandler," Good, good. Listen, heh, I dunno what Shelley told you about me, but,
uh... I'm not."
264,Chandler, Really.
266,Chandler, So- you can tell?
268,Chandler," So you don't think I have a, a quality?"
270,Chandler, He is?
272,Chandler," Out of my league. I could get a Brian. (Brian enters behind him) If I
wanted to get a Brian, I could get a Brian. (Sees him) Hey, Brian."
0,Rachel," Terry, I, I, I know that I haven't worked here very long, but I was
wondering, do you think it would be possible if I got a $100 advance in my salary?"
2,Rachel," It's so that I can spend Thanksgiving with my family. See, every year we
go skiing in Vail, and normally my father pays for my ticket, but I sort of started the
whole independence thing, you know, which is actually why I took this job."
4,Rachel," Ok, I, I hear what you're sayin'. I'm with you. Um, but I, but I'm
trying really hard. And I think I'm doing better. I really do. Does anybody need coffee?
(everyone in the place raises their hand) Oh, look at that."
6,Rachel," Excuse me, sir. Hi, you come in here all time. I was just wondering, do
you think there's a possibility that you could give me an advance on my tips?"
8,Rachel," Ok, ok, that's fine. Fine. Hey, I'm sorry about that spill before.
(picks up the tip he leaves) Only $98.50 to go. "
10,Monica," Hey. Ross, did you know Mom and Dad are going to Puerto Rico for
Thanksgiving?"
11,Ross," No, they're not."
12,Monica," Yes, they are. The Blymens invited them."
13,Ross, You're wrong.
14,Monica, I am not wrong.
15,Ross, You're wrong.
16,Monica," No, I just talked to them."
17,Ross," (getting up, upset) I'm calling Mom."
19,Joey," Hey, hey."
20,Chandler, Hey.
21,Phoebe, Hey.
22,Chandler, And this from the cry-for-help department. Are you wearing makeup?
23,Joey," Yes, I am. As of today, I am officially Joey Tribbiani, actor slash model."
24,Chandler," That's so funny, 'cause I was thinking you look more like Joey
Tribbiani, man slash woman."
25,Phoebe, What were you modeling for?
26,Joey, You know those posters for the city free clinic?
27,Monica," Oh, wow, so you're gonna be one of those ""healthy, healthy, healthy
guys""?"
28,Phoebe," You know, the asthma guy was really cute."
29,Chandler, Do you know which one you're gonna be?
30,Joey," No, but I hear lyme disease is open, so... (crosses fingers) "
31,Chandler," Good luck, man. I hope you get it."
32,Joey, Thanks.
34,Ross," (to Monica) Well, you were right. How can they do this to us, huh? It's
Thanksgiving. "
35,Monica," Ok, I'll tell you what. How about I cook dinner at my place? I'll make
it just like Mom's."
36,Ross, Will you make the mashed potatoes with the lumps?
37,Monica," You know, they're not actually supposed to have... (Ross looks at her
sheepishly) I'll work on the lumps. Joey, you're going home, right?"
38,Joey, Yeah.
39,Monica," And I assume, Chandler, you are still boycotting all the pilgrim
holidays."
40,Chandler," Yes, every single one of them."
41,Monica," Phoebe, you're gonna be with your grandma?"
42,Phoebe," Yes, and her boyfriend. But we're celebrating Thanksgiving in December
'cause he is lunar."
43,Monica," So you're free Thursday, then."
44,Phoebe," Yeah. Oh, can I come?"
45,Monica," Yeah. Rach, are you thinking you're gonna make it to Vail?"
46,Rachel," Absolutely. Shoop, shoop, shoop. Only a hundred and two dollars to go."
47,Chandler, I thought it was $98.50.
48,Rachel," Yeah, well it was. I, I broke a cup."
49,Ross," Well, I'm off to Carol's."
50,Phoebe," Ooh, ooh! Why don't we invite her?"
51,Ross," (mimicking) Ooh, ooh. Because she's my ex-wife, and will probably want to
bring her, ooh, ooh, lesbian life partner."
53,Ross," Hi, is uh, is Carol here?"
55,Ross," Oh, I uh, just came by to pick up my skull. Well, not mine, but...Susan
Come in."
56,Ross," Thanks. Yeah, Carol borrowed it for a class, and I have to get it back to
the museum."
58,Ross, Kinda like a big face without skin.
60,Ross," Ok. (browsing the apartment) Wow, you guys sure have a lot of books about
bein' a lesbian."
62,Ross," (picking up a book) Hey, hey, Yertle the Turtle. A classic."
64,Ross," The uh, the baby that hasn't been born yet? Wouldn't that mean you're...
crazy?"
66,Ross," You're not serious, I mean, you really... you really talk to it?"
68,Ross," Do you uh, do you talk about me?"
70,Ross, Really?
73,Ross," Look, if she's talking to it, I just think that I should get some belly
time too. Not that I believe any of this."
74,Phoebe," Oh, I believe it. I think the baby can totally hear everything. I can
show you. Look, this will seem a little weird, but you put your head inside this turkey,
and then we'll all talk, and you'll hear everything we say."
75,Chandler," I'd just like to say that I'm totally behind this experiment. In fact,
I'd very much like to butter your head."
77,Monica," Hey, Rach, did you make your money?"
78,Rachel," No, not even close. Forget Vail, forget seeing my family, forget shoop,
shoop, shoop."
79,Monica," Rach, here's your mail."
80,Rachel," Thanks, you can just put it on the table."
81,Monica," (insistently) No, here's your mail."
82,Rachel," Thanks, you can just put it on the table."
83,Monica, (gives her an envelope) Would you just open it?
85,Rachel," Oh my god, oh, you guys are great."
86,Monica, We all chipped in.
87,Joey, (to Monica) We did?
88,Monica, (to Joey) You owe me 20 bucks.
89,Rachel, Thank you. Thank you so much!
90,Monica," (hands Chandler a bag) Chandler, here you go, got your traditional
Thanksgiving feast, you got your tomato soup, your grilled cheese fixin's, and your family
size bag of Funyuns."
91,Rachel," Wait, wait, Chandler, this is what you're havin' for Thanksgiving
dinner? What, what, what is it with you and this holiday?"
92,Chandler," All right, I'm nine years old."
93,Ross," Oh, I hate this story."
94,Chandler," We just finished this magnificent Thanksgiving dinner. I have--and I
remember this part vividly--a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parents
choose to tell me they're getting divorced."
95,Rachel, Oh my god.
96,Chandler," Yes. It's very difficult to appreciate a Thanksgiving dinner once
you've seen it in reverse."
98,Joey," Uh, hi. We uh, we used to work together."
100,Joey," Yeah, at Macy's. You were the Obsession girl, right? I was the Aramis guy.
(pretends to spray cologne) Aramis? Aramis? "
102,Joey, I gotta tell you. You're the best in the business.
104,Joey," I'm serious. You're amazing. You know when to spritz, when to lay back."
106,Joey," Ooh, you smell great tonight. What're you wearing?"
108,Joey," Listen, uh, you wanna go get a drink or something?"
110,Joey, What's wrong?
112,Joey, Oh. What?
114,Joey," Wait, wait, wait!"
117,Joey, So I guess you all saw it.
118,Rachel, Saw what?
119,Phoebe," No, we were just laughing. You know, how laughter can be infectious."
121,Joey, Set another place for Thanksgiving. My entire family thinks I have VD.
122,Chandler," Tonight, on a very special Blossom."
124,Monica," Mmm, looking good. Ok, cider's mulling, turkey's turking, yams are
yamming. (notices Ross is depressed) What?"
125,Ross, I don't know. It's just not the same without Mom in the kitchen.
126,Monica," All right, that's it. You know what? Just get out of my way and stop
moping."
127,Ross, That's closer.
129,Rachel," I got the tickets! I got the tickets! Five hours from now, shoop, shoop,
shoop."
130,Chandler," Oh, you must stop shooping."
131,Rachel," Ok, I'm gonna get my stuff."
132,Joey," Chandler, will you just come in already?"
133,Chandler," No, I prefer to keep a safe distance from all this merriment."
135,Phoebe," Look out, incoming pumpkin pie!"
136,Chandler," Ok, we all laughed when you did it with the stuffing, but that's not
funny anymore."
138,Joey," Hey, Monica, I got a question. I don't see any tater tots."
139,Monica, That's not a question.
140,Joey," But my mom always makes them. It's like a tradition. You get a little
piece of turkey on your fork, a little cranberry sauce, and a tot! It's bad enough I can't
be with my family because of my disease."
141,Monica," All right, fine. Tonight's potatoes will be both mashed with lumps, and
in the form of tots."
142,Ross," Ok, I'm off to talk to my unborn child. "
144,Monica, Ah!
145,Ross," Ok, Mom never hit."
147,Phoebe," (stirring pot) Ok, all done."
148,Monica," What, Phoebe, did you whip the potatoes? Ross needs lumps!"
149,Phoebe," Oh, I'm sorry, oh, I just, I thought we could have them whipped and then
add some peas and onions."
150,Monica, Why would we do that?
151,Phoebe," Well, 'cause then they'd be like my mom used to make them, you know,
before she died."
152,Monica," Ok, three kinds of potatoes coming up."
153,Rachel," Ok, good-bye you guys. Thanks for everything. (she starts to leave, and
hits everyone with her skis) Oh, sorry! Oh, sorry!"
155,Chandler," The most unbelievable thing has happened. Underdog has just gotten
away."
156,Joey, The balloon?
157,Chandler," No, no, the actual cartoon character. Of course the balloon. It's all
over the news. Right before he reached Macy's, he broke free and was spotted
flying over Washington Square Park. I'm goin' to the roof, who's with me?"
158,Rachel," I can't, I gotta go."
159,Chandler," Come on. An 80-foot inflatable dog let loose over the city. How often
does that happen?"
160,Phoebe, Almost never.
161,Monica, Got the keys? or Got the keys!
162,Rachel, Ok.
166,Ross," Ok, ok, here we go. (he crouches down near her stomach) Ok, where am I
talking to, here? I mean, uh, well, there is one way that seems to offer a certain
acoustical advantage, but..."
168,Ross," Ok, ok, ok, ok, here goes. You know, I, you know, can't do this. Uh, this
is too weird. I feel stupid."
170,Ross," (quickly talking) Hello, baby. Hello, hello."
172,Rachel," I loved the moment when you first saw the giant dog shadow all over the
park."
173,Phoebe," Yeah, but did they have to shoot him down? I mean, that was just mean."
174,Monica," Ok, right about now the turkey should be crispy on the outside, juicy on
the inside. Why are we standing here?"
175,Rachel, We're waiting for you to open the door. You got the keys.
176,Monica, No I don't.
177,Rachel," Yes, you do. When we left, you said, ""got the keys."""
178,Monica," No I didn't. I asked, ""got the ke-eys?"""
179,Rachel," No, no, no, you said, ""got the keys""."
180,Chandler, Do either of you have the keys?
181,Monica, (panicked) The oven is on.
182,Rachel," Oh, I gotta get my ticket!"
183,Joey," Wait, wait, we have a copy of your key."
184,Monica," Well then get it, get it!"
185,Joey, That tone will not make me go any faster.
186,Monica, (angry) Joey!
187,Joey, That one will. 
190,Ross," And everyone's telling me, you gotta pick a major, you gotta pick a major.
So, on a dare, I picked paleontology. And you have no idea what I'm saying, because, let's
face it, you're a fetus. You're just happy you don't have gills anymore."
192,Ross," Oh, please. I am not singing to your stomach, ok?"
195,Ross," Shh! (singing) Here we come, walkin' down the street, get the funniest
looks from, everyone we meet. Hey, hey! (to Carol) Hey, uh, did you just feel that?"
197,Ross," Does it always, uh--?"
200,Ross," (singing) Hey, hey, you're my baby, and I can't wait to meet you. When
you come out I'll buy you a bagel, and then we'll go to the zoo."
202,Ross," (singin) Hey, hey, I'm your daddy. I'm the one without any breasts."
204,Joey," Nope, not that one."
205,Monica, Can you go any faster with that?
206,Joey," Hey, I got one keyhole and about a zillion keys. You do the math."
207,Monica, Why do you guys have so many keys in there anyway?
208,Chandler, (sarcastic) For an emergency just like this.
209,Rachel," (grabs Chandler by the shirt) All right, listen, smirky. If it wasn't
for you and your stupid balloon, I would be on a plane watching a woman do this (makes a
gesture like a stewardess pointing out exits) right now. But I'm not."
210,Monica, I swear you said you had the keys.
211,Rachel," No, I didn't. I wouldn't say I had the keys unless I had the keys, and I
obviously didn't have the keys."
212,Phoebe," Ooh, ok, that's it. Enough with the keys. No one say keys."
214,Monica, Why would I have the keys?
215,Rachel, Aside from the fact that you said you had them?
216,Monica, But I didn't.
217,Rachel," Well, you should have."
218,Monica, Why?
219,Rachel, Because!
220,Monica, Why?
221,Rachel, Because!
222,Monica," Why? Because everything is my responsibility? Isn't it enough that I'm
making Thanksgiving dinner for everyone? You know, everyone wants a different kind of
potatoes, so I'm making different kinds of potatoes. Does anybody care what kind of
potatoes I want? Nooooo, no, no! (starting to cry) Just as long as Phoebe gets her peas
and onions, and Mario gets his tots, and it's my first Thanksgiving, and it's all burned,
and, and I... I..."
223,Chandler," Ok, Monica, only dogs can hear you now, so, look, the door's open.
Here we go."
225,Monica," Well, the turkey's burnt. (checking pots) Potatoes are ruined, potatoes
are ruined, potatoes are ruined."
227,Ross," Here we come, walkin' down the—this doesn't smell like Mom's."
228,Monica," No, it doesn't, does it? But you wanted lumps, Ross? (picks up the pan
of badly burnt potatoes) Well, here you go, buddy, ya got one."
229,Rachel," Oh, god, this is great! The plane is gone, so it looks like I'm stuck
here with you guys."
230,Joey," Hey, we all had better plans. This was nobody's first choice."
231,Monica," Oh, really? So why was I busting my ass to make this delicious
Thanksgiving dinner?"
232,Joey, You call that delicious? 
234,Monica," Stop it, stop it, stop it!"
235,Chandler, Now this feels like Thanksgiving.
237,Phoebe, Ooh. 
238,Rachel, What?
239,Phoebe," Ugly Naked Guy's taking his turkey out of the oven. Oh my god. He's not
alone. Ugly Naked Guy's having Thanksgiving dinner with Ugly Naked Gal."
241,Joey, I've gotta see this. All right Ugly Naked Guy!
242,Monica," Ooh, Ugly Naked Dancing!"
243,Phoebe, It's nice that he has someone.
245,Chandler, Shall I carve?
246,Rachel, By all means.
247,Chandler," Ok, who wants light cheese, and who wants dark cheese?"
248,Ross, I don't even wanna know about the dark cheese.
249,Monica, (holding sandwich) Does anybody wanna split this with me?
250,Joey," Oh, I will."
251,Phoebe," Ooh, you guys have to make a wish."
252,Monica, Make a wish?
253,Phoebe," Come on, you know, Thanksgiving. Ooh, you got the bigger half. What'd
you wish for?"
254,Joey, The bigger half.
255,Chandler," I'd like to propose a toast. Little toast here, ding ding. I know this
isn't the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been
really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting.
Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with
your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know?
So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings
sucked."
257,Ross," And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas."
258,Rachel, And a crappy New Year.
259,Chandler," Here, here!"
0,Ross, Guys? There's a somebody I'd like you to meet. 
3,Monica, W-wait. What is that?
4,Ross, 'That' would be Marcel. You wanna say hi?
5,Monica," No, no, I don't."
6,Rachel," Oh, he is precious! Where did you get him?"
7,Ross, My friend Bethel rescued him from some lab.
8,Phoebe, That is so cruel! Why? Why would a parent name their child Bethel?
9,Chandler," Hey, that monkey's got a Ross on its ass!"
10,Monica," Ross, is he gonna live with you, like, in your apartment?"
11,Ross," Yeah. I mean, it's been kinda quiet since Carol left, so..."
12,Monica, Why don't you just get a roommate?
13,Ross," Nah, I dunno... I think you reach a certain age, having a roommate is
kinda pathe- (Realises) ....sorry, that's, that's 'pathet', which is Sanskrit for 'really
cool way to live'."
16,Phoebe," So you guys, I'm doing all new material tonight. I have twelve new songs
about my mother's suicide, and one about a snowman."
17,Chandler, Might wanna open with the snowman.
20,Monica," So, how'd it go?"
21,Joey," Ahhhhhh, I didn't get the job."
22,Ross, How could you not get it? You were Santa last year.
23,Joey," I dunno. Some fat guy's sleeping with the store manager. He's not even
jolly, it's all political."
24,Monica, So what are you gonna be?
25,Joey," Ah, I'm gonna be one of his helpers. It's just such a slap in the face,
y'know?"
26,Rachel," Hey, do you guys know what you're doing for New Year's? (They all
protest and hit her with cushions) Gee, what?! What is wrong with New Year's?"
27,Chandler," Nothing for you, you have Paolo. You don't have to face the horrible
pressures of this holiday desperate scramble to find anything with lips just so you can
have someone to kiss when the ball drops!! Man, I'm talking loud!"
28,Rachel," Well, for your information, Paolo is gonna be in Rome this New Year, so
I'll be just as pathetic as the rest of you. "
29,Phoebe," Yeah, you wish!"
30,Chandler," It's just that I'm sick of being a victim of this Dick Clark holiday.
I say this year, no dates, we make a pact. Just the six of us- dinner."
32,Chandler," Y'know, I was hoping for a little more enthusiasm. "
34,Rachel," Phoebe, you're on."
35,Phoebe," Oh, oh, good."
36,Rachel," (Into microphone) Okay, hi. Ladies and gentlemen, back by popular
demand, Miss Phoebe Buffay. Wooh!"
37,Phoebe," (Takes mike) Thanks, hi. Um, I wanna start with a song that means a lot
to me this time of year. (Shakes bell as an introduction) (Sung) "
40,Phoebe, (Sung) 
43,Phoebe, (Sung) 
47,Phoebe," Well, c'mon, if it's important enough to discuss while I'm playing, then
I assume it's important enough for everyone else to hear!"
48,Chandler," (Quietly, to the others) That guy's going home with a note!"
50,Phoebe, Could you speak up please?
56,Phoebe," Okay, we're gonna take a short break. (Goes over to their table)"
57,Joey," Hey, that guy's going home with more than a note!"
59,Ross," Come here, Marcel. Sit here. (Marcel wanders off)"
60,Rachel," Pheebs, I can't believe he hasn't kissed you yet. I mean God, by my
sixth date with Paolo, I mean he had already named both my breasts! ...Ooh. Did I just
share too much?"
61,Ross, Just a smidge.
62,Phoebe," David's like, y'know, Scientist Guy. He's very methodical."
63,Monica, I think it's romantic.
64,Phoebe, Me too! Oh! Did you ever see An Officer and a Gentleman?
65,Rachel, Yeah!
66,Phoebe," Well, he's kinda like the guy I went to see that with. Except, except
he-he's smarter, and gentler, and sweeter... I just- I just wanna be with him all the
time. Day and night, and night and day... and special occasions... "
67,Chandler," Wait a minute, wait a minute, I see where this is going, you're gonna
ask him to New Year's, aren't you. You're gonna break the pact. She's gonna break the
pact."
68,Phoebe," No, no, no, no, no, no. Yeah, could I just?"
69,Chandler," Yeah, 'cause I already asked Janice."
70,Monica, What?!
71,Ross," C'mon, this was a pact! This was your pact! "
72,Chandler," I snapped, okay? I couldn't handle the pressure and I snapped."
73,Monica," Yeah, but Janice? That-that was like the worst breakup in history!"
74,Chandler," I'm not saying it was a good idea, I'm saying I snapped!"
76,Joey," Hi. Hi, sorry I'm late."
78,Chandler, Too many jokes... must mock Joey! 
79,Joey," Nice shoes, huh? (He wiggles his foot and the bells tinkle)"
80,Chandler," Aah, y'killing me!"
82,Monica, Ross! He's playing with my spatulas again!
83,Ross," Okay, look, he's not gonna hurt them, right?"
84,Monica, Do you always have to bring him here?
85,Ross," I didn't wanna leave him alone. Alright? We- we had our first fight this
morning. I think it has to do with my working late. I said some things that I didn't mean,
and he- he threw some faeces..."
86,Chandler," Y'know, if you're gonna work late, I could look in on him for you."
87,Ross," Oh, that'd be great! Okay, but if you do, make sure it seems like you're
there to see him, okay, and you're not like doing it as a favour to me."
88,Chandler," Okay, but if he asks, I'm not going to lie."
91,Phoebe," Okay, alright, I have a question, then. "
93,Phoebe," Um, were you planning on kissing me ever?"
95,Phoebe, Sure.
97,Phoebe," Oh, David, I, I think you are a sweeping sorta fella. I mean, you're a
sweeper! ...trapped inside a physicist's body."
99,Phoebe," Oh, yeah, oh, I'm sure of it. You should just do it, just sweep and
throw me. "
101,Phoebe," Oh yeah, right now."
103,Phoebe," Okay, now you're just kinda tidying. "
105,Phoebe, I can hop. (She hops onto the table)
108,Ross, So tell me something. What does the phrase 'no date pact' mean to you?
109,Monica," I'm sorry, okay. It's just that Chandler has somebody, and Phoebe has
somebody- I thought I'd ask Fun Bobby."
110,Chandler, Fun Bobby? Your ex-boyfriend Fun Bobby?
111,Monica, Yeah.
112,Joey, You know more than one Fun Bobby?
113,Chandler, I happen to know a Fun Bob.
114,Rachel," (Brings Joey a mug of coffee) Okay, here we go..."
115,Joey," Ooh ooh ooh ooh, there's no room for milk!"
116,Rachel, (Glances at Joey and then sips his coffee) There. Now there is.
117,Ross," Okay, so on our no-date evening, three of you now have dates."
118,Joey," Uh, four."
119,Ross, Four.
120,Rachel, Five.
121,Ross, Five. (Buries his head in his hands)
122,Rachel, Sorry. Paolo's catching an earlier flight.
123,Joey," Yeah, and I met this really hot single mom at the store. What's an elf to
do?"
124,Ross," Okay, so I'm gonna be the only one standing there alone when the ball
drops?"
125,Rachel," Oh, c'mon. We'll have, we'll have a big party, and no-one'll know who's
with who."
126,Ross," Hey, y'know, this is so not what I needed right now."
127,Monica, What's the matter?
128,Ross," Oh, it's-it's Marcel. He keeps shutting me out, y'know? He's walking
around all the time dragging his hands... "
129,Chandler," That's so weird, I had such a blast with him the other night."
130,Ross, Really.
131,Chandler," Yeah, we played, we watched TV.. that juggling thing is amazing."
132,Ross," What, uh... what juggling thing?"
133,Chandler, With the balled-up socks? I figured you taught him that.
134,Ross, No.
135,Chandler," Y'know, it wasn't that big a deal. He just balled up socks... and a
melon..."
138,Phoebe," Oh, hi Max! Hey, do you know everybody?"
140,Phoebe," No, no, he hasn't been around."
142,Phoebe, Minsk?
144,Phoebe, I know where Minsk is.
146,Phoebe," So when, when do you leave?"
150,Phoebe, Hello?
152,Phoebe, Hi.
154,Phoebe," Um, well, Max told me about Minsk, so (Puts on a fake cheery voice)
congratulations! This is so exciting!"
156,Phoebe," Oh, you're not going? (Fake disappointed voice) Oh, why?"
159,Phoebe, So-so you're really not going?
161,Phoebe, Oh don't do that.
163,Phoebe, Oh no no.
165,Phoebe," Oh, but I can't do that-"
167,Phoebe," It's your thing, and-"
169,Phoebe," Okay, um, stay."
171,Phoebe, Stay.
173,Phoebe, Getting so good at that! (She hops on)
177,Chandler, You remember Janice.
178,Monica, Vividly.
180,Monica, Hi.
182,Joey," Sandy! Hi! C'mon in! (She enters, followed by a young boy and a younger
girl)...You brought your kids."
185,Ross, Par-tay! 
186,Monica, That thing is not coming in here.
187,Ross," 'That thing'? This is how you greet guests at a party? Let me ask you
something, if I showed up here with my new girlfriend, she wouldn't be welcome in your
home?"
188,Monica, I'm guessing your new girlfriend wouldn't urinate on my coffee table.
189,Ross," Okay. He was more embarrassed about that than anyone. Okay? And for him to
have the courage to walk back in here like nothing happened..."
190,Monica, Alright. Just keep him away from me.
191,Ross," Thank you. (She walks off) C'mon, Marcel, whaddya say you and I do a
little mingling? (Marcel runs off) Alright, I'll, uh... catch up with you later."
193,Monica," Oh my gosh! Rachel, honey.. are you okay? Where-where's Paolo?"
194,Rachel, Rome. Jerk missed his flight.
195,Phoebe, And then... your face is bloated?
196,Rachel," No. Okay. I was at the airport, getting into a cab, when this woman-
this blonde planet with a pocketbook- starts yelling at me. Something about how it was her
cab first. And then the next thing I know she just starts- starts pulling me out by my
hair! So I'm blowing my attack whistle thingy and three more cabs show up, and as I'm
going to get into a cab she tackles me. And I hit my head on the kerb and cut my lip on my
whistle...oh...everybody having fun at the party? (To Monica) Are people eating my dip?"
199,Joey," Wow, that's, uh, dirty."
202,Joey," Hey, kids..."
203,Ross," (Watching Marcel play with Phoebe. To Chandler) Look at him. I'm not
saying he has to spend the whole evening with me, but at least check in."
205,Chandler, (Imitating) But you found me!
207,Chandler, Kill me. Kill me now. 
209,Monica, Hey everybody! It's Fun Bobby!
212,Joey, (Approaching) Hey Fun Bobby! Whoah! Who died?
217,Chandler," Alright, Janice, that's it! Janice... Janice... Hey, Janice, when I
invited you to this party I didn't necessarily think that it meant that we-"
219,Chandler, I'm sorry you misunderstood...
222,Chandler," Oh, will you give me the thing. (Snatches the camera)"
224,Phoebe," Hi, Max!"
228,Phoebe, Are you alright?
231,Phoebe, You're going to Minsk.
233,Phoebe," Oh, you are so going to Minsk. You belong in Minsk. You can't stay here
just 'cause of me."
235,Phoebe," Oh yes, yes, yes you can. Just say, um, 'Phoebe, my work is my life and
that's what I have to do right now'. And I say 'your work?! Your work?! How can you say
that?!'. And then you say, um, 'it's tearing me apart, but I have no choice. Can't you
understand that?'. And I say (Hits him) 'no! No! I can't understand that!'."
237,Phoebe," Ooh, sorry. Um, and, and then you put your arms around me. And then you
put your arms around me. (He does so) And, um, and then you tell me that you love me and
you'll never forget me."
239,Phoebe," And then you say that it's almost midnight and you have to go because
you don't wanna start the new year with me if you can't finish it. (They kiss) I'm gonna
miss you. You scientist guy."
242,Joey," There y'go, kids."
243,Chandler," (To a woman who he has clearly just met) And then the peacock bit me.
(Laughs) Please kiss me at midnight. (She leaves)"
244,Joey, You seen Sandy?
245,Chandler," Ooh. Uh, I don't know how to tell you this, but she's in Monica's
bedroom, getting it on with Max, that scientist geek. Ooh, look at that, I did know how to
tell you."
246,Rachel," Vrrbddy, the bll is drrbing."
248,Rachel, The bll is drrbing!
250,Chandler, And the moment of joy is upon us.
251,Joey, Looks like that no date pact thing worked out.
252,Phoebe, Everybody looks so happy. I hate that.
253,Monica, Not everybody's happy. Hey Bobby!
255,Chandler," Y'know, I uh.. just thought I'd throw this out here. I'm no math whiz,
but I do believe there are three girls and three guys right here. (Makes kiss noise)"
256,Phoebe, I dunno. I don't feel like kissing anyone tonight.
257,Rachel, I can't kiss anyone.
258,Monica, So I'm kissing everyone?
259,Joey," Nonono, you can't kiss Ross, that's your brother."
260,Ross, Perfect. Perfect. So now everybody's getting kissed but me.
261,Chandler," Alright, somebody kiss me. Somebody kiss me, it's midnight! Somebody
kiss me!"
262,Joey, Alrightalrightalright. (Kisses him. Ross takes a photo) There.
265,Ross," (Watching Marcel and talking to Rachel) I wanted this to work so much. I
mean I'm still in there, changing his diapers, pickin' his fleas... but he's just phoning
it in. Just so hard to accept the fact that something you love so much doesn't love you
back."
266,Rachel, ...I think that bitch cracked my tooth.
0,Phoebe, Do you think they have yesterday's daily news?
1,Monica, Why?
2,Phoebe," Just wanna check my horoscope, see if it was right."
3,Monica," Oh my God. (Grabs Phoebe and turns her away) Phoebe. Don't look now, but
behind us is a guy who has the potential to break our hearts and plunge us into a pit of
depression. "
4,Phoebe," Where? (Turns to face him) Ooh, come to Momma."
5,Monica," He's coming. Be cool, be cool, be cool."
10,Phoebe, We should do something. Whistle.
11,Monica, We are not going to whistle.
12,Phoebe," Come on, do it."
13,Monica, No!
14,Phoebe, Do it!
15,Monica, No!
16,Phoebe, Do it do it do it!
17,Monica, (Shouts to the guy) Woo-woo!
19,Phoebe, I can't believe you did that!
22,Monica," Why did I 'woo-hoo'? I mean, what was I hoping would happen? That-that
he'd turn round and say 'I love that sound, I must have you now'?"
23,Phoebe," I just wish there was something we could do. (Bends down and talks to
him) Hello. Hello, Coma Guy. GET UP, YOU GIRL SCOUT! UP! UP! UP!"
24,Monica," Phoebe, what are you doing?"
25,Phoebe, Maybe nobody's tried this.
26,Monica," I wish we at least knew his name... Look at that face. I mean, even
sleeping, he looks smart. I bet he's a lawyer."
27,Phoebe," Yeah, but did you see the dents in his knuckles? That means he's
artistic."
28,Monica," Okay, he's a lawyer, who teaches sculpting on the side. And- he can
dance!"
29,Phoebe," Oh! And, he's the kinda guy who, when you're talking, he's listening,
y'know, and not saying 'Yeah, I understand' but really wondering what you look like naked."
30,Monica, I wish all guys could be like him.
31,Phoebe, I know.
33,Chandler, Are there no conscious men in the city for you two?
34,Monica, He doesn't have anyone.
35,Phoebe," Yeah, we-we feel kinda responsible."
36,Joey, I can't believe you said woowoo. I don't even say woowoo.
37,Rachel," Oh, she's coming up! She's coming up! (Turns on the TV)"
40,Chandler," Y'know, we don't have to watch this. Weekend At Bernie's is
on Showtime, HBO, and Cinemax."
41,Rachel," No way, forget it."
42,Joey," C'mon, she's your mom!"
43,Chandler," Exactly. Weekend At Bernie's! Dead guy getting hit in the
groin twenty, thirty times! No?"
44,Rachel," Chandler, I gotta tell you, I love your mom's books! I love her books! I
cannot get on a plane without one! I mean, this is so cool!"
45,Chandler," Yeah, well, you wouldn't think it was cool if you're eleven years old
and all your friends are passing around page 79 of 'Mistress Bitch.'"
46,Ross," C'mon, Chandler, I love your mom. I think she's a blast."
47,Chandler, You can say that because she's not your mom.
48,Ross," Oh, please..."
51,Rachel," Oh, hi sweetie. (They kiss)"
52,Ross, When did Rigatoni get back from Rome?
53,Monica, Last night.
54,Ross," Ah, so then his plane didn't explode in a big ball of fire?... Just a
dream I had- but, phew."
55,Phoebe, Hey hey hey! She's on!
58,Phoebe, Your mom was arrested?
59,Chandler," Shhh, busy beaming with pride."
61,Chandler, Now why would she say that's embarrassing?
64,Chandler, THAT'S TOO MUCH INFORMATION!!
68,Chandler, This is the way that I find out. Most moms use the phone.
72,Chandler, ...And then he burst into flames.
74,Monica," Let's see. Congress is debating a new deficit reduction bill... the
mayor wants to raise subway fares again... the high today was forty-five... and- oh, teams
played sports."
76,Phoebe, What about Glen? He could be a Glen. 
77,Monica, Nah... not-not special enough.
78,Phoebe, Ooh! How about Agamemnon?
79,Monica, Waaay too special.
82,Chandler, Please God don't let it be Kung Pow Chicken.
84,Chandler," Well, I think you need to come out of your shell just a little."
85,Ross, (Entering) What is this dive? Only you could've picked this place.
87,Chandler, I know I am.
89,Monica, Yeah.
90,Phoebe, I'm in.
92,Ross," Uh, I'm not really a shot drinking kinda guy."
94,Rachel," Hi! Sorry- sorry we're late, we, uh, kinda just, y'know, lost track of
time."
95,Ross, ...But a man can change. (Downs a shot)
97,Ross, Anyone want me to appraise anything?
99,Rachel," Mrs. Bing, I have to tell you, I've read everything you've ever written.
No, I mean it! I mean, when I read Euphoria at Midnight, all I wanted to do was become a
writer."
101,Chandler," Myyy mother, ladies and gentlemen."
106,Ross," Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine. (A woman emerges from the toilet behind him and
he tries to pretend he was in the other one)"
108,Ross, Nothing. Nothing nothing nothing.
110,Ross, No. It's the one he's licking.
112,Ross, You're good.
114,Ross, The girl on the cover with her nipples showing?
116,Ross, When?
118,Ross, The guy on the cover with his nipples showing?
120,Ross, Please.
122,Ross, Right.
125,Ross, Uh-oh...
128,Joey, Uhhhh.... I'll just pee in the street.
131,Ross," Hey, is Chandler here?"
132,Joey, Yeah.
134,Ross," Okay, uh, about last night, um, Chandler.. you didn't tell... (Joey shakes
his head) Okay, 'cause I'm thinking- we don't need to tell Chandler, I mean, it was just a
kiss, right? One kiss? No big deal? Right?"
135,Joey, Right. No big deal.
136,Ross, Okay. 
137,Joey, In Bizarro World!! You broke the code!
138,Ross, What code?
139,Joey," You don't kiss your friend's mom! Sisters are okay, maybe a hot-lookin'
aunt... but not a mom, never a mom!"
141,Chandler, What are you guys doing out here?
142,Ross," Uh.. uh.. Well, Joey and I had discussed getting in an early morning
racquetball game. But, um, apparently, somebody overslept."
143,Joey," Yeah, well, you don't have your racket."
144,Ross," No, no I don't, because it's being restrung, somebody was supposed to
bring me one."
145,Joey," Yeah, well you didn't call and leave your grip size."
146,Chandler," Okay, you guys spend waaaay too much time together. (Goes back inside
and shuts the door)"
147,Ross," Okay, I'm scum, I'm scum."
148,Joey," Ross, how could you let this happen?"
149,Ross," I don't know, God, I... well, it's not like she's a regular mom, y'know?
She's, she's sexy, she's..."
150,Joey, You don't think my mom's sexy?
151,Ross, Well... not in the same way...
152,Joey," I'll have you know that Gloria Tribbiani was a handsome woman in her day,
alright? You think it's easy giving birth to seven children?"
153,Ross," Okay, I think we're getting into a weird area here..."
155,Rachel, Hey.
156,Ross, Hey.
157,Rachel, What're you guys doing out here?
158,Ross," Well, not playing raquetball!"
159,Joey, He forgot to leave his grip size!
160,Ross, He didn't get the goggles!
161,Rachel," Well,sounds like you two have issues."
163,Rachel," Goodbye, baby."
166,Ross, Do they wait for me to do this?
168,Joey, So are you gonna tell him?
169,Ross, Why would I tell him?
170,Joey," How about 'cause if you don't, his mother might."
171,Ross, Oh...
172,Monica, (Entering) What are you guys doing here?
173,Joey, Uhhhh.... he's not even wearing a jockstrap!
174,Monica, ...What did I ask?
176,Monica, Hi.
177,Phoebe, Hi.
178,Monica, What are you doing here?
179,Phoebe," Nothing, I just thought I'd stop by.. y'know, after the uh... that I..
y'know, so what are you doing here?"
180,Monica," I'm not really here. Just thought I'd drop these off...on the way.. my
way... Do you come here a lot? Without me?"
181,Phoebe," No. (Monica brushes Coma Guy's hair in the other direction) No! No!
...So, um, do you think he's doing any better than he was this morning?"
182,Monica, How would I know? I-I wasn't here.
183,Phoebe," Really? Not even to, um, change his PAJAMAS?! (Whips back the sheet to
reveal him wearing new pajamas.)"
185,Chandler, Oh my God. 
186,Ross, You're my friend. I-I had to tell you.
187,Chandler, I can't believe it. Paolo kissed my mom?
188,Ross," Yeah, um, I don't know if you noticed, but he had a lot to drink, and you
know how he gets when he's drun..uh... (He has caught sight of Joey scowling at him) I
can't do this, I did it, it was me, I'm sorry, I kissed your mom."
189,Chandler, What?
190,Ross," I was really upset about Rachel and Paolo, and I think I had too much
tequila, and Nora- um, Mrs. Mom- your Bing- was just being nice, y'know, and- But nothing
happened, nothing- Ask Joey, Joey, uh, came in-"
191,Chandler, (To Joey) You knew about this?
192,Joey," Uh... y'know, knowledge is a tricky thing."
193,Chandler," I spent the entire day with you, why didn't you tell me?!"
194,Joey," Hey, hey, hey, you're lucky I caught them when I did, or else who knows
what woulda happened."
195,Ross," Thanks, man, big help."
196,Chandler, (To Ross) I can't believe this! What the hell were you thinking?
197,Ross," I wasn't- I mean, I-"
198,Chandler," Y'know, of all my friends, no-one knows the crap I go through with my
mom more than you. "
199,Ross, I know-
200,Chandler, I can't believe you did this. (Walks toward the door)
201,Ross, Chandler-
202,Joey," Me neither, y'know what-"
203,Chandler, I'm still mad at you for not telling me.
204,Joey, What are you mad at me for?!
205,Ross, Chandler-
206,Chandler, You gotta let me slam the door! (Leaves; slams the door)
207,Joey," (Shouting after him) Chandler, I didn't kiss her, he did! (To Ross) See
what happens when you break the code?"
208,Ross, Joey-
209,Joey, Ah! (Points to door) Huh? (Leaves and slams the door)
211,Monica, Hey.
212,Rachel, Hey.
213,Monica," (Reading) 'A Woman Undone, by Rachel Karen Green'. "
214,Rachel," Yeah. Thought I'd give it a shot. I'm still on the first chapter. Now,
do you think his 'love stick can be liberated from its denim prison'?"
215,Monica," (Reads) Yeah, I'd say so. And there's no 'j' in 'engorged'."
216,Phoebe, (Walks up with her guitar) Hey Rach.
217,Rachel, Hey.
218,Phoebe, Hello.
219,Monica, Hello. 
220,Phoebe, Going to the hospital tonight?
221,Monica," No, you?"
222,Phoebe," No, you?"
223,Monica, You just asked me.
224,Phoebe," Okay, maybe it was a trick question. (Plays a few chords) Um, Rachel can
we do this now?"
225,Rachel, Okay. (Writes a little more) I am so hot!
226,Joey," (To Ross, on the couch) Now, here's a picture of my mother and father on
their wedding day. Now you tell me she's not a knockout."
227,Ross, I cannot believe we're having this conversation.
228,Joey," C'mon! Just try to picture her not pregnant, that's all."
229,Rachel, (Into microphone) Central Perk is proud to present Miss Phoebe Buffay.
230,Phoebe," Thanks. Hi, um, 'kay. I'd like to start with a song that's about a man
that I recently met, who's, um, come to be very important to me. (Monica gives her a look)
'Kay. (Sung) "
233,Rachel," (Into mike) Okay, that was Phoebe Buffay, everybody. Woo!"
235,Chandler, What was that?
236,Ross," Oh, uh, Phoebe just started a..."
237,Chandler," Yeah, I believe I was talking to Joey, alright there, Mother-Kisser?
(Goes to the counter)"
238,Joey, (Laughing) Mother-Kisser... (Sees Ross's look) I'll shut up.
239,Ross," Chandler, can I just say something? I-I know you're still mad at me, I
just wanna say that there were two people there that night. Okay? Two sets of lips."
240,Chandler," Yes, well, I expect this from her. Okay? She's always been a Freudian
nightmare. "
241,Ross," Okay, well, if she always behaves like this, why don't you say something?"
242,Chandler," Because it's complicated, it's complex- Hey, you kissed my mom!"
244,Ross, (To the rest of Central Perk) We're rehearsing a Greek play.
245,Chandler, That's very funny. We done now?
246,Ross," No! Okay, you mean, you're not gonna talk to her, you're not gonna tell
her how you feel?"
247,Chandler," That would be no. Look, just because you played tonsil tennis with my
mom doesn't mean you know her. Alright? Trust me, you can't talk to her."
248,Ross," Okay, 'you' can't, or (Points to Chandler) you can't? (Chandler grabs his
finger) Okay, that's my finger. (Chandler twists it and Ross goes down on one knee)
That's, that's my knee. (To Central Perk) Still doing the play. Aaah!"
250,Phoebe," Alright, whadyou do with him?"
252,Monica, Oh! You're awake!
253,Phoebe," Look at you! How, how do you feel?"
255,Monica, You look good!
257,Monica," Oh, sorry."
258,Phoebe, I'm Phoebe Buffay.
259,Monica, I'm Monica Geller. I've been taking care of you.
260,Phoebe," Well, we both have."
262,Phoebe," Well, actually it's just from me."
263,Monica, I got you the foot massager.
264,Phoebe, You know who shaved you? That was me.
265,Monica, I read to you.
266,Phoebe, I sang. (To Monica) Hah!
268,Monica," Oh, my pleasure."
269,Phoebe, You're welcome.
271,Phoebe," What, that's it? "
272,Monica," ""See you around?"""
274,Monica," Oh, I don't know. Maybe, um, ""That was nice?"" Admit something
to me? ""I'll call you?"" "
276,Phoebe, I don't think you mean that.
277,Monica," This is so typical. Y'know, we give, and we give, and we give. And then-
we just get nothing back! And then one day, y'know, it's just, you wake up, and ""See
you around!"" Let's go, Phoebe."
278,Phoebe," Y'know what? We thought you were different. But I guess it was just the
coma."
281,Chandler," No, just knowing you're gonna be there is enough."
283,Chandler, You kissed my best Ross! ...Or something to that effect.
285,Chandler, Really stupid.
287,Chandler, Yeah. No. No...
289,Ross," Ah, the forbidden love of a man and his door."
290,Joey," Shh. He did it. He told her off, and not just about the kiss, about
everything."
291,Ross, You're kidding.
292,Joey," No, no. He said ""When are you gonna grow up and start being a
mom?"""
293,Ross, Wow!
294,Joey," Then she came back with ""The question is, when are you gonna grow up
and realise I have a bomb?"""
295,Ross," 'Kay, wait a minute, are you sure she didn't say ""When are you gonna
grow up and realise I am your mom?"""
296,Joey, That makes more sense.
297,Ross," So, what's going on now?"
298,Joey," I dunno, I've been standing here spelling it out for you! (Goes back to
the door) I don't hear anything. Oh, wait, wait, wait. (Looks through the spyhole)"
299,Ross, Whaddya see?
300,Joey," Hard to tell, they're so tiny and upside-down. Wait, wait. They're walking
away... they're walking away... No, no they're not, they're coming right at us! Run! Run!"
303,Chandler," Yeah, okay."
305,Chandler, Nice save.
307,Ross, (Very politely) Mrs. Bing.
311,Chandler, Hey.
312,Ross, You mean that?
313,Chandler," Yeah, why not. (They shake hands) So I told her."
314,Ross, Yeah? How'd it go?
315,Chandler, Awful. Awful. Couldn'ta gone worse. 
316,Ross," Well, howdya feel?"
317,Chandler, Pretty good! I told her.
318,Ross," Well, see? So, maybe it wasn't such a bad idea, y'know, me kissing your
mom, uh? Huh? (Wags his finger at Chandler, then puts it down) But.. we don't have to go
down that road."
321,Rachel," Okay. Now this is just the first chapter, and I want your absolute
honest opinion. Oh, oh, and on page two, he's not 'reaching for her heaving beasts'."
322,Monica, What's a 'niffle'?
323,Joey, You usually find them on the 'heaving beasts'.
324,Rachel," Alright, alright, so I'm not a great typist..."
325,Ross," Wait, did you get to the part about his 'huge throbbing pens'? Tell ya,
you don't wanna be around when he starts writing with those!"
326,Rachel," Alright, that's it! Give it back! That's it!"
0,Chandler," No-no-no-no, we're done."
3,Monica," Aunt Syl, stop yelling! All I'm saying is that if you had told
me vegetarian lasagna, I would have made vegetarian lasagna. (pauses, listens to person on
phone) Well, the meat's only every third layer, maybe you could scrape."
5,Joey," Ross, did you really read all these baby books?"
6,Ross," Yup! You could plunk me down in the middle of any woman's uterus, no
compass, and I can find my way out of there like that! (snaps fingers)"
7,Phoebe," Ooh, this is cool...it says in some parts of the world, people actually
eat the placenta. (Joey grimaces)"
8,Chandler," And, we're done with the yogurt. (Sets yogurt down on table)"
9,Phoebe," (softly) Sorry. (Camera pans back to Monica, still on phone)"
10,Monica," Aunt Syl, I did this as a favor, I am not a caterer. What do you want me
to do with a dozen lasagnas? (listens to Aunt Syl on phone, looks shocked) Nice talk, Aunt
Syl. (in New York accent) You kiss Uncle Freddie with that mouth?"
12,Joey," Hey Ross, listen, you know that right now, your baby's only this big?
(measures about 2 inches with his thumb and index finger) This is your baby. (in baby-like
voice) Hi Daddy! "
13,Ross, (waves) Hello!
14,Joey," (in baby-like voice) How come you don't live with Mommy? (pause;
shows Ross less than amused) How come Mommy lives with that other lady? (pause; Ross still
looks less than amused; Joey smiling) What's a lesbian? (playfully hits Ross)"
16,Rachel," Honey, you can say it, Poconos, Poconos, it's like Poc-o-nos (touching
Paolo's nose with forefinger with each syllable)"
20,Monica," So, did I hear Poconos?"
21,Rachel," Yes, my sister's giving us her place for the weekend."
22,Phoebe," Woo-hoo, first weekend away together!"
23,Monica," Yeah, that's a big step."
24,Rachel, I know...
26,Chandler," (to Ross) Ah, it's just a weekend, big deal!"
27,Ross," Wasn't this supposed to be just a fling, huh? Shouldn't it be...(makes
flinging motions with hands) flung by now?"
29,Rachel," I mean, we are way past the fling thing, I mean, I am feeling things
that I've only read about in Danielle Steele books, you know? I mean, when I'm with him,
I'm totally, totally..."
31,Ross," ...nauseous, I'm physically nauseous. What am I supposed to do, huh? Call
immigration? (pauses, looks suddenly inspired) I could call immigration!"
33,Joey," I love babies, with their little baby shoes, and their little baby toes,
and their little baby hands... "
34,Chandler," Ok, you're going to have to stop that, forever!"
36,Joey, Need a new table.
37,Chandler, You think?
41,Ross," Hey, hello! mmwa! (kisses Carol) I brought all the books, and Monica sends
her love, along with this lasagna. "
43,Ross, (pauses) I'm pretty sure that it is...
45,Ross," (making flinging gestures with hands) Oh, tell me, tell me, is
everything, uhh....? "
47,Ross," Oh, that's great, that is great! (Hugs and kisses Carol. Then picks up a
picture frame)"
48,Ross," Hey, when did you and Susan meet Huey Lewis?"
50,Ross," (surprised, chuckling nervously) Of course it's your friend
Tanya. (looks up frightenedly)"
52,Ross," (chuckles nervously) The sex? (chuckles) Um, I'm having enough
trouble with the image of you and Susan together, when you throw in Tanya (miming washing
hair, that's the best I could think of), yaw..."
54,Ross," Oh, you know the sex of the baby? Oh, oh-oh-oh!"
56,Ross," No, no, no, no, no, I don't want to know, absolutely not. I think, you
know, I think you should know until you look down there, and say, oop, there it is!
(pauses) Or isn't..."
59,Ross, Susan...
61,Ross," Yes, we did, everything's A-OK!"
64,Ross," (flailing arms in protest) Oh, hey hey hey, ho ho ho, hello, guy
who doesn't want to know, standing right here!"
67,Ross," Ok, what, what...ok, what did we think it was going to be? "
69,Ross," (interrupts) No, no, no I don't want to know, don't want to
know. Ok, you know, I should probably, I should probably just go. "
71,Ross," No problem, ok, mmmwa (kisses Carol) oh, mmmwa (kisses Carol's stomach,
then punches Susan's shoulder) Susan... (Ross leaves.)"
74,Ross," (on intercom) Uh, never mind, I don't want to know. (Carol and
Susan laugh)"
76,Chandler," Ok, so it's just because it was my table, I have to buy a new one?"
77,Joey, That's the rule.
78,Chandler," What rule? There's no rule, if anything, you owe me a table!"
79,Joey, How'd you get to that?
80,Chandler," Well, I believe the piece of furniture was fine until your little
breakfast adventure with Angela Delvecchio"
81,Joey, You knew about that?
82,Chandler," Well, let's just say the impressions you made in the butter left
little to the imagination."
83,Joey," Ok, ok, How about if we split it?"
84,Chandler," What do you mean, like, buy it together?"
85,Joey, Yeah
86,Chandler, You think we're ready for something like that?
87,Joey, Why not?
88,Chandler," Well, it's a pretty big commitment, I mean, what if one of us wants to
move out?"
89,Joey," Why, are you moving out?"
90,Chandler, I'm not moving out. 
91,Joey, You'd tell me if you were moving out right
92,Chandler," Yeah, yeah, it's just that with my last roommate Kip..."
93,Joey," Aw, I know all about Kip!"
94,Chandler," It's just that we bought a hibachi together, and then he ran off and
got married, and things got pretty ugly."
95,Joey," Well, let me ask you something, was Kip a better roommate than me?"
96,Chandler," Aw, don't do that"
99,Phoebe," Ok, thanks. (assistant leaves, then walks back in)"
102,Phoebe," Oh, Paolo, hi, what are you doing here?"
104,Phoebe," Well, Racquela's right, yeah!"
106,Phoebe," Oh, okay, I don't know what you just said, so let's get started."
108,Phoebe," Um, that's really your decision, I mean, some people prefer, you know,
to take off...oh whoops! You're being naked!"
110,Rachel," (to Ross) I can't believe you don't want to know. I mean, I
couldn't not know, I mean, if, if the doctor knows, and Carol knows, and Susan knows.... "
111,Monica, And Monica knows...
112,Ross," Wha, heh, how could you know, I don't even know!"
113,Monica," Carol called me to thank me for the lasagna, I asked, she told me."
114,Joey," So what's it gonna be? (Monica whispers in Joey's ear. Ross gets up and
waves arms frantically in protest)"
115,Ross," Wait—oh—hey—huh, oh great now he knows, and I don't know!"
116,Monica," I'm sorry, I'm just excited about being an aunt!"
117,Joey, Or an uncle... 
120,Ross, Hi Pheebs!
121,Rachel, Pheebs!
122,Phoebe, Fine!
123,Monica," Phoebe, what's the matter?"
124,Phoebe," Nothing, I'm sorry, I'm just, I'm out of sorts."
126,Rachel," Oh, right, that's me!"
127,Joey," Hey, Chandler, that table place closes at 7, come on."
128,Chandler, Fine. (Joey and Chandler walk towards the door)
129,Monica," Phoebe, what is it?"
130,Phoebe," All right, you know Paolo?"
131,Ross," I'm familiar with his work, yes..."
132,Phoebe," Well, he made a move on me."
134,Joey," Whoa, store will be open tomorrow!"
135,Chandler," More coffee over here, please!"
138,Monica," Well, what happened?"
139,Phoebe," Well, he came in for a massage, and everything was fine until.
(A flashback starts Paolo, lying on massage table, moving his hands up Phoebe's legs.)"
142,Ross, My God.
143,Monica, Are you sure?
146,Phoebe," Oh yeah, I'm sure. (Flashback resumes with Phoebe doing a voiceover.)
And all of a sudden his hands weren't the problem anymore. (Flashback continues Paolo
rolls over, Phoebe looks down, then quickly looks up, bites lip, shakes her head)"
147,Monica, Was it...?
148,Phoebe," Oh, boy scouts could have camped under there."
151,Rachel," ""Ooo,"" what?"
152,Phoebe, Uma Thurman.
153,Monica, Oh!
154,Ross, The actress!
156,Ross, Thanks Rach.
158,Chandler, So what are you gonna do?
159,Ross," You have to tell her! You have to tell her! It's your moral obligation, as
a friend, as a woman, I think it's a feminist issue! Guys? Guys? (waiting for guys to
chime in)"
160,Chandler," Oh, yeah, you have to tell her."
161,Joey, Feminist issue. That's where I went!
162,Phoebe, She is gonna hate me.
163,Ross,"(sympathetic yet...) Yeah, well..."
165,Joey," Will you pick one, just pick one! Here, how about that one? (points to a
table)"
166,Chandler, That's patio furniture!
167,Joey," So what, like people are gonna come in and think, ""Uh-oh, I'm outside
again?"" Of course!"
168,Chandler, (gesturing towards another table) What about the birds?
169,Joey," I don't know, birds just don't say, ""Hello, sit here, eat
something."""
170,Chandler, You pick one.
171,Joey," All right, how about the ladybugs?"
172,Chandler," Oh, so, forget about the birds, but big red insects suggest fine
dining!"
173,Joey," Fine, you want to get the birds, get the birds!"
174,Chandler," Not like that, I won't! (pauses) Kip would have liked the birds! (Joey
turns and gives Chandler a dirty look)"
176,Phoebe, Hey!
177,Rachel, Hi Pheebs!
178,Phoebe, Are you moving out?
179,Rachel," No, these aren't all my suitcases. (picks up small blue suitcase and
shows to Phoebe) This one's Paolo's."
180,Phoebe," Um, um, Rachel can we talk for a sec?"
181,Rachel," Well, sure...just a sec, though, 'cause Paolo's on his way over."
182,Phoebe," Oh! (sits down) Ok, um, ok, um, "
183,Rachel," Oh, Pheebs, Pheebs..."
184,Phoebe," Ok, um, (clears throat) we haven't known each other for that long a
time, and, um, there are three things that you should know about me. One, my friends are
the most important thing in my life, two, I never lie, and three, I make the best oatmeal
raisin cookies in the world. (Phoebe opens a tin and offers Rachel a cookie)"
185,Rachel," (taking cookie) Ok, thanks Pheebs (takes bite of cookie,
overwhelmed) Oh my God, why have I never tasted these before?!"
186,Phoebe," Oh, I don't make them a lot because I don't think it's fair to the other
cookies"
187,Rachel," All right, well, you're right, these are the best oatmeal cookies I've
ever had."
188,Phoebe, Which proves that I never lie.
189,Rachel, I guess you don't.
190,Phoebe, Paolo made a pass at me.
193,Chandler," So, what do you think?"
194,Ross, I think It's the most beautiful table I've ever seen.
195,Chandler, I know!
197,Monica," So how does this work, you going to balance the plates on these little
guys' heads?"
198,Joey," Who cares, we'll eat at the sink! Come on, let's play!"
199,Monica," Heads up Ross! (Monica scores on Chandler and Joey) Score! (points at
Chandler) You suck!"
202,Phoebe, Are you okay?
203,Rachel, I need some milk.
204,Phoebe," Ok, I've got milk (takes thermos from her bag and starts to pour a cup)
Here you go... (Rachel drinks straight from thermos) Oh!(Rachel finishes thermos) Better?"
205,Rachel," No...oh, I feel so stupid! Oh, I think about the other
day with you guys and I was all ""Oh, Paolo, he's so great, he makes me feel
so..."" Oh, God, I'm so embarrassed!"
206,Phoebe," I'm so embarrassed, I'm the one he hit on!"
208,Rachel," Pheebs, if I had never met him this never would have happened!"
210,Phoebe," No, wait, oh, what are we sorry about?"
211,Rachel," I don't know...right, he's the pig!"
212,Phoebe, Such a pig!
213,Rachel," Oh, God, he's such a pig, "
214,Phoebe, Oh he's like a...
215,Rachel, He's like a big disgusting... 
216,Phoebe, ...like a...
217,Rachel, ...pig...pig man!
218,Phoebe," Yes, good! Ok..."
219,Rachel," (voice wavers) Oh, but he was my pig man...how did I not see this?"
220,Phoebe," (raises hand) Oh! I know! (Rachel startled) It's because... he's
gorgeous, and he's charming, and when he looks at you..."
221,Rachel," Ok, Ok, Pheebs..."
222,Phoebe, The end.
223,Rachel," Oh, God..."
224,Phoebe, Should I not have told you?
225,Rachel," No, no, trust, me, it's, it's, it's much better that I know. Uh, I just
liked it better before it was better..."
228,Phoebe," I think she took it pretty well. You know Paolo's over there right now,
so..."
229,Monica," We should get over there and see if she's okay. (switching
places with Ross) Just one...second! Score! (Monica scores, high-fives with Ross) Game!
Come on. (Monica and Phoebe leave)"
230,Ross," (wiping his brow) Ah...ooh! Well, looks like, uh, we kicked your
butts."
231,Joey," No-no, she kicked our butts. You could be on the Olympic standing-there
team."
232,Ross," Come on, two on one."
233,Chandler," What are you still doing here? She just broke up with the guy, it's
time for you to swoop in!"
234,Ross," What, now?"
235,Joey," Yes, now is when you swoop! You gotta make sure that when Paolo walks out
of there, the first guy Rachel sees is you, She's gotta know that you're everything he's
not! You're like, like the anti-Paolo!"
236,Chandler," My Catholic friend is right. She's distraught. You're there for her.
You pick up the pieces, and then you usher in the age of Ross! (Ross and Chandler look off
into the distance. Joey, wondering what they are looking at, looks in the same direction)"
240,Ross, (entering) How's it going?
241,Monica," Don't stare. Now she just finished throwing his clothes off the balcony,
now there's just a lot of gesturing and arm-waving, (shows Rachel gesturing with hands in
front of her chest), Ok, that is either, ""How could you?"" or, ""Enormous
breasts!"" Here he comes! "
242,Phoebe, Ooh!
245,Phoebe," Oh, ok bye-bye."
246,Monica," Paolo, I really hate you for what you did to Rachel, (hands him a
lasagna) but I still have five of these, so heat it at 375 until the cheese bubbles."
248,Ross," Paolo, I-I just want to tell you and I think I speak for everyone when I
say... (shuts door in his face and walks away)"
249,Phoebe," Oh, just look at her... (girls move toward Rachel on the balcony)"
250,Ross," Oh you guys, I-I really think just one of us should go out there so she's
not overwhelmed..."
251,Monica," Oh, you're right."
252,Ross, (pulls Monica back) ...and I really think it should be me.
254,Ross, Hey.
255,Rachel, Hey.
256,Ross, You all right?
257,Rachel," Ooh, I've been better..."
258,Ross," Come here. (he hugs Rachel) Listen, you deserve so much better than
him...you know, I mean, you, you, you should be with a guy who knows what he has when he
has you."
259,Rachel," Oh, Ross..."
260,Ross, What?
261,Rachel," I am so sick of guys. I don't want to look at another guy, I don't want
to think about another guy, I don't even want to be near another guy. (Ross crosses arms)"
262,Ross, Huh.
263,Rachel," Oh Ross, you're so great!"
264,Ross, Ohhhh (Hugs her and sighs)
266,Monica," Ooh...hey honey, are you all right?"
267,Rachel, Oh...
268,Phoebe, You ok?
269,Rachel, ...medium...hmm...any cookies left?
270,Phoebe, Yep!
271,Ross," See, Rach, uh, see, I don't think that swearing off guys altogether is the
answer. I really don't. I think that what you need is to develop a more sophisticated
screening process."
272,Rachel," No. I just need to be by myself for a while, you know? I just got to
figure out what I want"
273,Ross," Uh, no, no, see, because not...not all guys are going to be a Paolo."
274,Rachel," No, I know, I know, and I'm sure your little boy is not going to grow up
to be one."
275,Ross, (astonished) What? 
276,Rachel, What?
277,Ross," I-I'm, I'm having a boy?"
278,Rachel," Uh...no. No, no, in fact, you're not having a boy."
279,Ross," Wha-I'm having, I'm having a boy! (babbling) Huh, am I having a boy?"
281,Ross," I'm having a boy! Oh, I'm having a boy!"
283,Chandler, Wha-
284,Joey, Wha-
286,Ross, I'm having a boy! I-I'm having a boy!
287,Joey, Hey!
288,Chandler, Hey!
290,Ross, I'm having a son. Um...
294,Monica, Yes! And that would be a shut-down!
296,Monica," Where are you guys going? Come on, one more game!"
297,Joey," Uh, it's 230 in the morning!"
298,Chandler," Yeah, get out!"
299,Monica," You guys are always hanging out in my apartment! Come on, I'll only use
my left hand, huh? Come on, wussies! (Joey and Chandler pick her up) All right, ok, I
gotta go. I'm going, (they throw her out) and I'm gone."
300,Chandler, (to Joey) One more game?
301,Joey, Oh yeah!
0,Rachel," That is it! You just barge in here, you don't knock"
1,Chandler, I'm sorry!
2,Rachel, You have no respect for anybody's privacy!
3,Chandler," Rachel, wait, wait."
4,Rachel," No, you wait! This is ridiculous!"
5,Chandler, Can I just say one thing?
6,Rachel, What? What?!
7,Chandler," That's a relatively open weave and I can still see your... nipular
areas."
8,Rachel, Oh!!
12,Phoebe," Oh, honey, honey, tell them the story about your patient who thinks
things are, like, other things. Y'know? Like, the phone rings and she takes a shower."
14,Phoebe, Oops!
16,Phoebe," Thanks. Okay, now go away so we can talk about you."
18,Phoebe, Isn't he great?
19,Rachel, He's so cute! And he seems to like you so much.
20,Phoebe," I know, I know. So sweet... and so complicated. And for a shrink, he's
not too shrinky, y'know?"
21,Monica," So, you think you'll do it on his couch?"
22,Phoebe," Oh, I don't know, I don't know. I think that's a little weird, y'know?
Vinyl."
23,Rachel," Okaaay. (To the guys, on the couch) Any of you guys want anything else?"
24,Chandler," Oh, yes, could I have one of those. (Points)"
25,Rachel," No, I'm sorry, we're all out of those. Anybody else?"
26,Chandler, Okay.
28,Chandler," No, she's still upset because I saw her boobies."
29,Ross, You what? Wh what were you doing seeing her boobies?
30,Chandler," It was an accident. Not like I was across the street with a telescope
and a box of donuts."
31,Rachel," Okay, okay, could we change the subject, please?"
32,Phoebe," Yeah, 'cause hello, these are not her boobies, these are her breasts."
33,Rachel," Okay, Pheebs, I was hoping for more of a change."
34,Chandler," Y'know, I don't know why you're so embarrassed, they were very nice
boobies."
35,Rachel," Nice? They were nice. I mean, that's it? I mean, mittens are nice."
36,Chandler," Okaaay, (Gestures) rock, hard place, me."
38,Chandler," Whoah whoah, back up there, Sparky. What'd you mean by that?"
40,Chandler, Huh.
42,Chandler," Uhhuh, how did you know that?"
45,Joey," Hey you guys. Hey, you all know my dad, right?"
47,Monica," Hey, how long are you in the city?"
49,Phoebe," Oh, this is my friend Roger."
54,Joey," Dad, dad. (Shakes his head)"
59,Joey," (Snatches the phone) Hey Ma. Listen, I made the appointment with Dr.
Bazida, and... Excuse me? (To his dad) Did you know this isn't Ma?"
62,Joey, Sure. So how long you been... (Goes back to chopping)
64,Joey, Since then?!
66,Joey, ...I d'know.
68,Joey, You're one to talk. (Puts the mushrooms in a saucepan)
70,Joey, Oh man. Please tell me one of 'em is Ma.
73,Joey," It's like if you woke up one day and found out your dad was leading this
double life. He's like actually some spy, working for the C.I.A. (Considers) That'd be
cool.... This blows!"
74,Rachel," I know, I mean, why can't parents just stay parents? (She walks over
near Chandler and his gaze stays very obviously on her chest) Why do they have to become
people? Why do they have... (Notices Chandler) Why can't you stop staring at my breasts?"
75,Chandler, (Without looking up) What? (Looks up) What?
76,Rachel, Did you not get a good enough look the other day?
77,Ross," Alright, alright. We're all adults here, there's only one way to resolve
this. Since you saw her boobies, I think, uh, you're gonna have to show her your peepee."
78,Chandler," Y'know, I don't see that happening?"
79,Rachel," C'mon, he's right. Tit for tat."
80,Chandler, Well I'm not showing you my 'tat.'
82,Monica, Hello?
83,Phoebe, (Intercom) It's Phoebe.
85,Monica, C'mon up.
86,Chandler," (Sarcastic) Oh, good. Rog is here."
87,Joey, What's the matter with Rog?
88,Ross, Yeah.
89,Chandler," Oh, it's nothing, it's a little thing... I hate that guy."
90,Ross," What, so he was a little analytical. That's what he does, y'know? C'mon,
he's not that bad."
92,Ross," Y'see, that's where you're wrong. Why would I marry her if I thought on
any level thatthat she was a lesbian?"
94,Ross, Why? Why would I why? Why? Why? Why?
96,Monica," Wait-wait, go back to that sibling thing."
98,Ross, That that's ridiculous! I don't feel guilty for her failures!
99,Monica, Oh! So you think I'm a failure!
100,Phoebe, Isn't he good?
101,Ross," Nonono, thatthat's not what I was saying..."
102,Monica," Y'know, all these years, I thought you were on my side. But maybe what
you were doing was sucking up to Mom and Dad so they'd keep liking you better!"
103,Ross," Hey, I married a lesbian to make you look good!"
105,Rachel," You're right! I mean you're right! It wasn't just the Weebles, but it
was the Weeble Play Palace, and and the Weebles' Cruise Ship. Oh, which had this little
lifeboat for the Weebles to wobble in. "
107,Phoebe," Oh, okay. Feel better, Rachel, 'kay?"
109,Phoebe," Oh, okay. Listen, thanks for everything, Mon."
110,Monica, You're welcome.
113,Monica, Hate that guy! (Throws another cookie)
115,Joey," Night, you guys."
117,Chandler," Oh look, it's the woman we ordered."
118,Joey," Hey. Can, uh, can we help you?"
120,Joey, I'm Joey Tribbiani.
122,Chandler," Uh, Joey's having an embolism, but I'd go for a Nip, y'know?"
126,Chandler," Joey, if I go first, I wanna be looking for my keys."
130,Joey," Dad, Ronni's here."
136,Chandler," So, who's up for a big game of Kerplunk?"
140,Joey, Who-ah-ho.
143,Joey, No you won't.
145,Joey," If you go to a hotel you'll be...doing stuff. I want you right here where
I can keep an eye on you."
147,Joey," That's right, mister, and I don't care how old you are, as long as you're
under my roof you're gonna live by my rules. And that means no sleeping with your
girlfriend."
149,Joey," Now dad, you'll be in my room, Ronni uh, you can stay in Chandler's room."
151,Chandler," C'mon, I'll show you to my room. ...That sounds so weird when it's not
followed by ""No thanks, it's late."" "
152,Joey," Okay. Now this is just for tonight. Starting tomorrow, you gotta make a
change. This has gone on long enough."
154,Joey," Well, either you break it off with Ronni"
156,Joey, Then you gotta come clean with Ma! This is not right!
158,Joey, I don't wanna hear it! Now go to my room!
160,Chandler," Hey, Kicky. What're you doing?"
161,Joey, Just trying to get comfortable. I can't sleep in my underwear. 
162,Chandler," Well, you're gonna."
163,Joey," I've been thinking. Y'know, about how I'm always seeing girls on top of
girls..."
164,Chandler," Are they end to end, or tall like pancakes?"
165,Joey," Y'know what I mean, about how I'm always going out with all these women.
And I always figured, when the right one comes along, I'd be able to be a stand-up guy and
go the distance, y'know? Now I'm looking at my dad, thinking..."
166,Chandler," Hey, you're not him. You're you. When they were all over you to go
into your father's pipe-fitting business, did you cave?"
167,Joey, No.
168,Chandler," No. You decided to go into the out-of-work actor business. Now that
wasn't easy, but you did it! And I'd like to believe that when the right woman comes
along, you will have the courage and the guts to say ""No thanks, I'm married."""
169,Joey, You really think so?
170,Chandler, Yeah. I really do.
171,Joey," Thanks, Chandler. (Snuggles up to him)"
172,Chandler, Get off!
175,Monica, Hi...May I help you?
177,Monica, Okay...who are you?
179,Monica," Oh, c'mon in."
181,Rachel," Hi, I'm Rachel."
183,Rachel, Bathroom's up there.
185,Rachel," Hey, listen, Ronni, how long would you say Chandler's been in the
shower?"
187,Rachel," Perfect. Fasten your seatbelts, it's peepee time. (She goes into Joey
and Chandler's apartment, where Mr. Tribbiani is reading the paper) Hey, Mr. Trib. "
190,Rachel, Chandler Bing? It's time to see your thing.
192,Joey, (Runs out in a towel) What's the matter with you?!
193,Rachel, I thought it was Chandler!
194,Chandler, (Comes out of his room) What? What?
195,Rachel, You were supposed to be in there so I could see your thing!
196,Chandler," Sorry, my my thing was in there with me."
199,Phoebe, Hey. 
200,Monica, How's it going?
201,Phoebe," Good. Oh oh! Roger's having a dinner thing and he wanted me to invite
you guys."
203,Phoebe, So what's going on?
204,Monica," Nothing, um, it's just, um... It's Roger. "
205,Ross," I dunno, there's just something about..."
206,Chandler, Basically we just feel that he's...
207,Rachel, We hate that guy.
209,Ross," We're sorry, Pheebs, we're sorry."
210,Phoebe," Uh-huh. Okay. Okay, don't you think, maybe, though, it's just that he's
so perceptive that it freaks you out?"
212,Rachel, We're sorry.
214,Joey, Ma! What're you doing here?
216,Joey, Oww! Big ring!
218,Joey," Hold on, you-you knew?"
220,Joey," So then how could you I mean, how could you?!"
222,Joey," Ma, I don't mean to be disrespectful, but... what the hell are you talking
about?! I mean, what about you?"
224,Joey, I'm...happy...for you?
226,Joey," Ma, I'm sorry. I just did what I thought you'd want."
228,Joey, Yeah. You're ten times prettier than she is.
230,Joey, With this ring? (Her engagement ring.) No contest.
233,Phoebe," Nothing, nothing."
235,Phoebe," It's, I mean, it's nothing, I'm fine. It's my friends. They-they have a
liking problem with you. In that, um, they don't."
237,Phoebe," But they don't see all the wonderfulness that I see. They don't see all
the good stuff and all the sweet stuff. They just think you're a little..."
239,Phoebe, Intense and creepy. 
241,Phoebe," But I don't. Me, Phoebe."
243,Phoebe," You're not? See, that's why you're so great! "
246,Monica," So you talked to your dad, huh."
247,Joey," Yeah. He's gonna keep cheating on my ma like she wanted, she's gonna keep
pretending she doesn't know even though she does, and my little sister Tina can't see her
husband any more because he got a restraining order...which has nothing to do with
anything except that I found out today."
248,Rachel, Wow.
249,Chandler, Things sure have changed here on Waltons mountain.
250,Ross," So Joey, you okay?"
251,Joey," Yeah, I guess. It's just parents, after a certain point, you gotta let go.
Even if you know better, you've gotta let them make their own mistakes."
252,Rachel," Just think, in a couple of years we get to turn into them."
253,Chandler," If I turn into my parents, I'll either be an alcoholic blond chasing
after twenty-year-old boys, or... I'll end up like my mom."
254,Phoebe, (entering) Hey.
256,Monica, How's it going?
257,Phoebe," Oh, okay, except I broke up with Roger."
259,Phoebe," Yeah, right."
261,Rachel, What happened?
262,Phoebe," I don't know, I mean, he's a good person, and he can be really sweet,
and in some ways I think he is so right for me, it's just... I hate that guy!"
265,Phoebe," Hey, Joey. What's going on?"
266,Joey," Clear the tracks for the boobie payback express. Next stop Rachel Green.
(He goes into the bathroom. We hear a scream and he comes out, closely followed by Monica
in a towel)"
267,Monica, Joey!! What the hell were you doing?!
268,Joey, Sorry. Wrong boobies.
270,Monica," Hello, Joey."
0,Joey," I'm tellin' you Ross, she wants you."
1,Ross, She barely knows me. We just live in the same building.
2,Chandler, Any contact?
3,Ross, She lent me an egg once.
4,Joey, You're in!
5,Ross," Aw, right."
7,Ross, Hey. (stutters something incoherent)
8,Chandler," Come on, Ross, you gotta get back in the game here, ok? The Rachel
thing's not happening, your ex-wife is a lesbian—I don't think we need a third... "
9,Joey," Excuse me, could we get an egg over here, still in the shell? Thanks."
10,Ross, An egg?
11,Joey," Yeah, you're gonna go up to her and say, ""Here's your egg back, I'm
returning your egg."""
12,Chandler, I think it's winning.
13,Ross, I think it's insane.
14,Chandler," She'll love it. Go with the egg, my friend."
16,Joey, Think it'll work?
17,Chandler," No, it's suicide. The man's got an egg."
19,Monica, You can not do this.
20,Rachel," Do what, do what?"
21,Monica, Roger wants to take her out tomorrow night.
22,Rachel, No! Phoebes! Don't you remember why you dumped the guy?
23,Phoebe," 'Cause he was creepy, and mean, and a little frightening... alright,
still, it's nice to have a date on Valentine's Day!"
24,Monica," But Phoebe, you can go out with a creepy guy any night of the year. I
know I do. "
25,Rachel," Well, what are you guys doing tomorrow night?"
26,Joey," Actually, tomorrow night kinda depends on how tonight goes."
27,Chandler," Oh, uh, listen, about tonight..."
28,Joey," No, no, no, don't you dare bail on me. The only reason she's goin' out
with me is because I said I could bring a friend for her friend."
29,Chandler," Yes, I know, but her friend sounds like such a..."
30,Joey," Pathetic mess? I know, but—come on, man, she's needy, she's
vulnerable. I'm thinkin', cha-ching! (Rachel throws a roll at Joey. He picks it up and
eats it.) Thanks. Look, you have not been out with a woman since Janice. You're doin'
this."
31,Ross, Hi. She said yes.
32,Chandler," Yes! Way to go, man! (Chandler and Ross hug. Something crunches in
Ross' shirt pocket.) Still got the egg, huh?"
34,Joey, (Looking at himself in the reflection on a knife) How do I look?
35,Chandler," Oh, uh, I... don't... care. (Joey's date shows up) Ok, now, remember,
no trading. You get the pretty one, I get the mess."
37,Chandler, ...And what did you bring?
39,Chandler, Janice?
42,Chandler," (angrily) Hey, it's Janice."
44,Chandler," Ok, I'm makin' a break for it, I'm goin' out the window. "
45,Joey," No, no, no, don't! I've been waitin' for like, forever to go out with
Lorraine. Just calm down. "
46,Chandler," Calm down? Calm down? You set me up with the woman that I've dumped
twice in the last five months!"
47,Joey," (at the urinal) Can you stop yellin'? You're makin' me nervous, and I
can't go when I'm nervous."
48,Chandler," I'm sorry, I'm sorry, you're right. (gets up right behind Joey and
yells in his ear) Come on, do it, do it, go, come on!!!"
50,Rachel," Ok, ok, Roger was creepy, but he was nothing compared to Pete Carney."
51,Monica, Which one was Pete Carney?
52,Rachel," Pete the Weeper? Remember that guy who used to cry every time we had
sex. (imitating) ""Was it good for you?"""
53,Monica," Yeah, well, I'll take a little crying any day over
Howard-the-""I-win""-guy. (imitating) ""I win! I win!"" I went out with
the guy for two months—I didn't get to win once."
54,Rachel, How did we end up with these jerks? We're good people!
55,Monica, I don't know. Maybe we're some kinda magnets.
56,Phoebe, I know I am. That's why I can't wear a digital watch.
57,Monica," There's more beer, right?"
58,Phoebe," Oh! You know my friend Abby who shaves her head? She said that if you
want to break the bad boyfriend cycle, you can do like a cleansing ritual."
59,Rachel," Pheebes, this woman is voluntarily bald."
60,Phoebe," Yeah. So, we can do it tomorrow night, you guys. It's Valentine's Day.
It's perfect."
61,Monica," Ok, well, what kind of ritual?"
62,Phoebe," Ok. We can, um, we can burn the stuff they gave us."
63,Rachel, Or?
64,Phoebe," Or...or we can chant and dance around naked, you know, with sticks."
65,Monica, Burning's good.
66,Rachel," Burning's good. Yeah, I got stuff to burn."
69,Joey," Good for you. (jumps suddenly) Uh, quarters or rolls of quarters?"
71,Chandler, That's OK.
74,Joey, (to Lorraine) We can't do that.
75,Chandler, (disgusted) What? What can't you do?
76,Joey," Uh, can I talk to you for a second, over there?"
78,Joey," Uh, we might be leaving now."
79,Chandler," Tell me it's ""you and me"" we."
80,Joey," She said she wants to slather my body with stuff and then lick it off. I'm
not even sure what slathering is, but I definitely want to be a part of it."
81,Chandler," Ok, you can not do this to me."
82,Joey," You're right, I'm sorry. You're right."
84,Joey," I'm outta here. Here's my credit card. Dinner's on me. I'm sorry,
Chandler."
85,Chandler, I hope she throws up on you.
87,Chandler, So...
89,Chandler," Oh, what a crappy night!"
91,Chandler," Excuse me. (gets up, jumps up and down while he zips his zipper up...
other patrons look at him) How ya doin'?"
93,Chandler," Joey's not a friend. He's...a stupid man who left us his credit card.
Another drink? Some dessert? A big screen TV?"
95,Chandler," You got it. Good woman! (the waiter turns around, it's a man) Could we
get a bottle of your most overpriced champagne?"
97,Chandler," That's right, each. Oh, and a uh Rob Roy. (to Janice) I've always
wanted to know..."
102,Chandler," No... no! And yet it did. Good-bye, Janice."
105,Monica," Oh, Chandler, sorry."
107,Monica," Ohhh, Chandler, sorry! Hey, Janice."
109,Chandler," Ok, well, this was very special."
110,Monica," Rach, come see who's out here!"
112,Rachel," Oh my god. Janice, hi!"
113,Chandler, Janice is gonna go away now.
114,Monica, I'll be right back.
116,Rachel," Oh, Joey, look who it is."
117,Joey, (in disbelief) Whoa.
118,Chandler," Oh, good, Joey's home now."
121,Monica," Oh, hi, Ross. Yeah. There's someone I want you to say hi to. (to
Chandler) He just happened to call."
124,Ross," I'm just sayin' if dogs do experience jet lag, then, because of the whole
um, seven dog years to one human year thing, then, when a dog flies from New York to Los
Angeles, he doesn't just lose three hours, he loses like a week and a half."
127,Ross," The blond woman is my ex-wife, and the woman touching her is her... close,
personal friend."
129,Ross, If you wanna put a label on it.
131,Ross," Nope, nope, that's it. "
133,Ross," Oh, and she's pregnant with my baby. I always forget that part. (to Carol
and Susan) Helloo!"
135,Phoebe," Ok, so now we need, um sage branches and the sacramental wine."
136,Monica," All I have is, is oregano and a Fresca."
137,Phoebe," Um, that's ok! (throws it in fire) Ok. All right. Now we need the semen
of a righteous man."
138,Rachel," Ok, Pheebs, you know what, if we had that, we wouldn't be doing the
ritual in the first place."
139,Monica, Can we just start throwing things in?
140,Phoebe," Ok, yeah, ok. (she throws the directions in) Oh, OK."
141,Rachel," (tossing things in the fire) Ok, Barry's letters. Adam Ritter's boxer
shorts."
142,Phoebe," Ok, and I have the, uh receipt for my dinner with Nokululu Oon Ah Ah."
143,Monica," Look, here's a picture of Scotty Jared naked."
144,Rachel, (looking at picture) Hey he's wearing a sweater.
145,Monica, No.
147,Rachel, And here we have the last of Paulo's grappa.
148,Monica," Hey, Rachel, isn't that stuff almost pure..."
151,Chandler, How can I dump this woman on Valentine's day?
152,Joey, I don't know. You dumped her on New Year's.
153,Chandler," Oh, man. In my next life, I'm coming back as a toilet brush."
156,Chandler," Hi, Just Janice."
159,Joey," (to Chandler) If you don't do it, I will."
161,Ross," So, um, what do you do for a living?"
165,Ross," Now that is funny. Hey, do you think...would it be too weird if I invited
Carol over to join us? 'Cause she's, she's alone now, and pregnant, and, and sad. "
167,Ross, Are you sure? Great. Carol? Wanna come over and join us?
169,Ross," Come on. These people'll scooch down. You guys'll scooch, won't you? Let's
try scooching! Come on. Come on. Uh, Kristen Riggs, this is Carol Willick. Carol, Kristin.
Uh, Carol teaches sixth grade. And, Kristin, Kristin...(struggling)...does something that,
funnily enough, wasn't even her major!"
173,Monica," You know, it's a really funny story how this happened."
176,Rachel, Really?
180,Chandler," Is it loaded? Oh, little candy hearts. (reading the candy) Chan and
Jan Forever."
182,Chandler," Ok, Janice. Janice. Hey, Janice. Look, there's no way for me to tell
you this. At least there's no new way for me to tell you this. I just don't things
are gonna work out."
184,Chandler, (surprised) It is?
186,Chandler," Oh no, you see, actually it is."
188,Chandler," Oh, no I don't."
190,Chandler," I did, but..."
193,Chandler, Call me!
196,Ross," You did so. I swear, I swear—(noticing Kristin's absence) How long
has she been in the bathroom?"
198,Ross," Well maybe it's cold in there. Or maybe I screwed up the first date I had
in 9 years. "
200,Ross," Oh, god. (He puts his head down on the grill) You know, this is still
pretty hot. (He picks his head up, and a mushroom sticks to his head. Carol picks it off
and eats it.)"
202,Ross," No, it's just...you know the whole ""getting on with your life""
thing. Well, do I have to? I mean, I'm sitting here with this cute woman, and, and, and
she's perfectly nice, and, but that there's, that's it. And um, and then I'm here talkin'
to you, and, and it's easy, and it's fun, and, and I don't, I don't have to...You know,
here's a wacky thought. Um, what's say you and I give it another shot? No no no, I know
what you're gonna say, you're a lesbian. But what do you say we just put that aside for
now you know? Let's just stick a pin in it, ok? Because, we're great together, you know.
You can't deny it. Besides, you're carrying my baby. I mean, how perfect is that? But see,
you know, you keep sayin' that, but there's somethin' right here. I love you."
205,Ross," No but, no but."
207,Ross," That's easy for you to say, you found one already."
213,Rachel," So, um, will you bring the truck?"
215,Rachel," Oh, my god."
216,Phoebe," See, there you go, the cleansing works!"
217,Monica, They're nice guys.
218,Rachel," Oh, they're firemen guys."
0,Rachel, (to Joey) Coffee. (Hands it to him.)
1,Joey, Thank you.
2,Rachel, (to Ross) Cappuccino. (Hands it to him.) 
3,Ross, Grazie.
4,Rachel, And a nice hot cider for Monica. (Hands it to her.)
5,Monica," Aww, thank you. (Notices something.) Uh Rach?"
6,Rachel, Yeah?
7,Monica, Why does my cinamon stick have an eraser?
8,Rachel," Oh! That's why. (Rachel checks behind her ear, and finds a cinamon
stick.) I'm sorry!"
12,Chandler," Mrs. Tedlock. You're looking lovely today. And may I say, that is a very
flattering sleeve length on you."
14,Chandler," Oh, listen. If this is about those prank memos, I had nothing to do
with them. Really. Nothing at all. Really. (Chandler tries to hide a rubber chicken from
the woman.) Nothing."
16,Phoebe," Hey you guys! Chandler's coming and he says he has, like, this
incredible news, so when he gets here, we could all act like, you know..."
18,Chandler, Hey!
20,Phoebe, Never mind. But it was going to be really good.
21,Ross, What's going on?
23,Chandler," So, it's a typical day at work. I'm inputting my numbers, and big Al
calls me into his office and tells me he wants to make me processing supervisor."
25,Chandler, So.... I quit.
27,Chandler, Why? This was supposed to be a temp job!
28,Monica," Yeah, Chandler... you've been there for five years."
29,Chandler," If I took this promotion, it'd be like admitting that this is what I
actually do."
30,Phoebe, So was it a lot more money?
31,Chandler," It doesn't matter. I just don't want to be one of those guys that's in
his office until twelve o'clock at night worrying about the WENUS."
33,Rachel, ... the WENUS?
34,Chandler, Weekly Estimated Net Usage Systems. A processing term.
35,Rachel, (sarcastic) Oh. That WENUS.
36,Joey, So what're you going to do?
37,Chandler," I don't know. That's the thing. I don't know what I want to do. I just
know I'm not going to figure it out working there."
38,Phoebe," Oooh! I have something you can do! I have this new massage client...
Steve? (pause) Anyway, he's opening up a restaurant and he's looking for a head chef."
39,Monica, (taps Phoebe on her shoulder) Um... hi there.
40,Phoebe," Hi! (turns back to Chandler, then to Monica) Oh, yeah, no, I know.
You're a chef. I know, and I thought of you first, but um, Chandler's the one who needs a
job right now, so...."
41,Chandler," Yeah... I just don't have that much cheffing experience. Unless it's
an all-toast restaurant."
42,Phoebe," (to Monica's tapping) Yeah, yeah! "
43,Monica," Well, what kind of food is he looking for?"
44,Phoebe," Well, he wants to do some ecclectic, so he's looking for someone who
can, you know, create the entire menu."
45,Monica, (excited) Oh my God!
46,Phoebe," Yeah, I know! (turns to Chandler) So, what do you think?"
47,Chandler," Thanks, Phoebe. But I just don't really see myself in a big white hat."
48,Phoebe, OK. (pause) Oh Monica! Guess what!
50,Chandler, Can you see my nipples through this shirt?
51,Rachel," No. But don't worry, I'm sure they're still there."
52,Phoebe," Where are you going, Mr. Suity-Man?"
53,Chandler," Well, I have an appointment to see Dr. Robert Pillman, career
counselor a-gogo. (pause) I added the ""a-gogo."""
54,Rachel, Career counselor?
55,Chandler," Hey, you guys all know what you want to do."
56,Rachel, I don't!
57,Chandler," Hey, you guys in the living room all know what you want to do.
You know, you have goals. You have dreams. I don't have a dream."
58,Ross," Ah, the lesser-known ""I don't have a dream"" speech."
60,Monica," Oh, I love my life, I love my life!"
61,Phoebe, Ooh! Brian's Song!
62,Rachel, The meeting with the guy went great?
63,Monica," So great! He showed me where the restaurant's going to be. It's this,
it's this cute little place on 10th Street. Not too big, not too small. Just right."
64,Chandler, Was it formerly owned by a blonde woman and some bears?
65,Monica," So anyway, I'm cooking dinner for him Monday night. You know, kind of
like an audition. And Phoebe, he really wants you to be here, which will be great for me
because then you can 'ooh' and 'ahh' and make yummy noises."
66,Rachel, What are you going to make?
67,Phoebe, (as though Rachel wasn't paying attention) Yummy noises.
68,Rachel," (pause) And Monica, what are you going to make?"
69,Monica, I don't know. I don't know. It's just going to be so great!
70,Phoebe," Ooh! I know what you could make! (runs over to join Monica and Rachel in
the kitchen) I know! Oh, you should definitely make that thing... you know, with the
stuff? (Monica doesn't know.) You know, that thing... with the stuff...? OK, I don't know.
(sits down)"
71,Ross," Hey guys, does anybody know a good date place in the neighborhood?"
72,Joey," How about Tony's? If you can finish a 32-ounce steak, it's free."
73,Ross," OK, ahem, hey, does anybody know a good place if you're not dating a puma?"
74,Chandler, Who are you going out with?
75,Phoebe," Oh, is this the bug lady?"
76,Rachel," (trying to sound like a bug) Bzzzz.... I love you, Ross."
77,Ross," Her name is Celia. She's not a bug lady. She's curator of insects at the
museum."
78,Rachel, So what are you guys going to do?
79,Ross," Oh, I just thought we could go out to dinner, and then maybe bring her
back to my place and I'd introduce her to my monkey."
80,Chandler, And he's not speaking metaphorically.
81,Joey," (aside to Ross) So.... back to your place...you thinking, maybe...
(gestures with hands, back and forth) huh-huh?"
82,Ross," Well, I don't know.... (gestures) huh-huh.... but I'm hoping (gestures)
huh-huh."
83,Joey," I'm telling you, that monkey is a chick magnet! She's going to take one
look at his furry, cute little face and it'll seal the deal."
85,Ross," Celia, don't worry!  Don't scream!  He's not going to hurt you!
Soothing tones, Celia. Soothing tones! Marcel..."
87,Ross, Alright... (lifts Marcel away)
89,Monica," (to Joey) OK, try this salmon mousse."
90,Joey, (tasting) Mmmm. Good.
91,Monica, Is it better than the other salmon mousse?
92,Joey, It's creamier.
93,Monica," Yeah, well, is that better?"
94,Joey," I don't know. We're talking about whipped fish, Monica. I'm just happy I'm
keeping it down, y'know?"
96,Rachel, My God! What happened to you?
97,Chandler," Eight and a half hours of aptitude tests, intelligence tests,
personality tests... and what do I learn? (he taps the results and reads them) ""You
are ideally suited for a career in data processing for a large multinational
corporation."""
98,Phoebe, That's so great! 'Cause you already know how to do that!
99,Chandler," Can you believe it? I mean, don't I seem like somebody who should be
doing something really cool? You know, I just always pictured myself doing
something...something."
100,Rachel," (comes up and rubs him on the chest) Oh Chandler, I know, I know... oh,
hey! You can see your nipples through this shirt!"
101,Monica," (brings a plate of tiny appetizers over) Here you go, maybe this'll
cheer you up."
102,Chandler," Ooh, you know, I had a grape about five hours ago, so I'd better split
this with you."
103,Monica," It's supposed to be that small. It's a pre-appetizer. The French call it
an amouz-bouche. "
104,Chandler, (tastes it) Well.... it is amouz-ing...
106,Monica," (on phone) Hello? (Listens) Oh, hi Wendy! (Listens) Yeah, eight o'clock.
(Listens) What did we say? Ten dollars an hour?... (Listens) OK, great. (Listens) All
right, I'll see you then. Bye. (hangs up)"
107,Phoebe, Ten dollars an hour for what?
108,Monica," Oh, I asked one of the waitresses at work if she'd help me out."
109,Rachel, (hurt) Waitressing?
110,Joey, Uh-oh.
111,Monica, Well... of course I thought of you! But... but...
112,Rachel," But, but?"
113,Monica," But, you see, it's just... this night has to go just perfect, you know?
And, well, Wendy's more of a... professional waitress."
114,Rachel," Oh! I see. And I've sort of been maintaining my amateur status so that I
can waitress in the Olympics."
115,Chandler," You know, I don't mean to brag, but I waited tables at Innsbruck in
'76. (dead silence) Amouz-bouche? (holds out tray)"
118,Ross," OK.... um, a weird thing happened to me on the train this morning..."
120,Ross," (embarrassed) Wha... what, here?"
122,Ross, Ah....
124,Ross, (panicked) Er.... um..... 
126,Ross, Um... uh.... vulva.
128,Joey, (in disbelief) Vulva?
129,Ross," Alright, I panicked, alright? She took me by surprise. You know, but it
wasn't a total loss. I mean, we ended up cuddling."
130,Joey, (sarcastic) Whoaa!! You cuddled? How many times??
131,Ross," Shut up! It was nice. I just... I don't think I'm the dirty-talking kind
of guy, you know?"
132,Joey," What's the big deal? You just say what you want to do to her. Or what you
want her to do to you. Or what you think other people might be doing to each other. I'll
tell you what. Just try something on me."
133,Ross, (deadpan) Please be kidding.
134,Joey," Why not? Come on! Just, just close your eyes and tell me what you'd like
to be doing right now."
135,Ross, OK. (closes eyes) I'm in my apartment...
136,Joey, ....yeah... what else?
137,Ross," That's it. I'm in my apartment, you're not there, we're not having this
conversation. (gets up, walks across room)"
138,Joey," (walks to catch up to him) Alright, look, I'll start, OK?"
139,Ross," Joey, please."
140,Joey," Come on. Come on. Alright, ready, look! (in a low voice) Oh... Ross....
you get me so hot. I want your lips on me now."
141,Ross, (impressed) Wow.
142,Joey," Alright, now you say something."
143,Ross, I... ahem... I really don't think so.
144,Joey," Come on! You like this woman, right?"
145,Ross, Yeah.
146,Joey," You want to see her again, right?"
147,Ross, Sure.
148,Joey," Well if you can't talk dirty to me, how're you going to talk dirty to her?
Now tell me you want to caress my butt!"
149,Ross," OK, turn around. (Joey looks taken aback) I just don't want you staring at
me when I'm doing this."
150,Joey," (turning around) Alright, alright. I'm around. Go ahead."
151,Ross," Ahem... I want.... OK, I want to... feel your... hot, soft skin with my
lips."
152,Joey, There you go! Keep going. Keep going!
153,Ross," I, er..."
155,Ross, I want to take my tongue... and... 
157,Ross, ....and....
158,Joey, Say it... say it!
159,Ross, ...run it all over your body until you're... trembling with... with...
161,Chandler, (smiling)....with??
162,Ross, (rushing to explain) Funny story!
163,Joey, You're not going to believe this!
164,Chandler," It's OK. It's OK. I was always rooting for you two kids to get
together."
165,Joey," Hey Chandler, while you were sleeping that guy from your old job called
again."
166,Chandler, Again?
167,Joey," And again, and again, and again... (phone rings, he answers) Hello? (hands
phone to Chandler) And again."
168,Chandler," (on phone) Hey Mr. Kostelic! How's life on the fifteenth floor?
(Listens) Yeah, I miss you too. (Listens) Yeah, it's a lot less satisfying to steal pens
from your own home, you know? (Listens) Well, that's very generous (Listens) er, but look,
this isn't about the money. I need something that's more than a job. I need something I
can really care about.... (Listens) And that's on top of the yearly bonus structure you
mentioned earlier? (Listens) Look, Al, Al... I'm not playing hardball here, OK? This is
not a negotiation, this is a rejection! (Listens) No! No! No, stop saying numbers! I'm
telling you, you've got the wrong guy! You've got the wrong guy! (Listens) I'll see you on
Monday! (slams the phone down)"
170,Chandler, Well?
171,Phoebe," (excited) Wow! It's huge! It's so much bigger than the cubicle. Oh, this
is a cube."
172,Chandler, Look at this! (he opens the curtain to a view of New York City)
173,Phoebe, Oh! You have a window!
174,Chandler, Yes indeedy! (they look outside) With a beautiful view of...
175,Phoebe, Oh look! That guy's peeing!
176,Chandler," (walks away from window) OK, that's enough of the view. Check this
out, look at this. Sit down, sit down."
177,Phoebe, (sitting) OK.
178,Chandler," This is great! (he presses a button on his intercom) Helen, could you
come in here for a moment? "
180,Chandler," Thank you Helen, that'll be all."
182,Chandler," Last time I do that, I promise."
184,Monica," (shouting on phone) Wendy, we had a deal! (Listens) Yeah, you promised!
Wendy! Wendy! Wendy! (hangs up)"
185,Rachel, Who was that?
186,Monica, Wendy bailed. I have no waitress.
187,Rachel, Oh... that's too bad. Bye bye. (she walks away towards the door)
188,Monica, Ten dollars an hour.
189,Rachel, No.
190,Monica, Twelve dollars an hour.
191,Rachel," Mon. I wish I could, but I've made plans to walk around."
192,Monica," You know, Rachel, when you ran out of your wedding, I was there for you.
I put a roof over your head, and if that means nothing to you... (Rachel isn't buying it,
desperate) twenty dollars an hour."
193,Rachel, Done.
195,Rachel, Well hello! Welcome to Monica's. May I take your coat?
196,Monica, Hi Steve!
198,Monica, (to Steve) This is Rachel.
200,Phoebe," (overemphasizing) Mmmmmm! Everything smells so delicious! You know, I
can't remember a time I smelt such a delicious combination of (Monica signals her to stop)
of, OK, smells."
202,Monica," Oh, thank you. Would you like a tour?"
205,Rachel, What's up?
206,Phoebe," (whispers) In the cab, on the way over, Steve blazed up a doobie."
207,Rachel, What?
208,Phoebe," Smoked a joint? You know, lit a bone? Weed? Hemp? Ganja?"
209,Rachel," OK, OK. I'm with you, Cheech. OK."
211,Rachel," Let me, let me get you some wine!"
212,Monica," Yeah, I think we're ready for our first course. (Steve sits, Monica
brings over a tray) OK, um, these are rot-shrimp ravioli, and celantro pondou sauce...
(Steve starts to eat them one by one, quickly)... with just a touch of mints... and... (he
finishes)... ginger."
214,Monica, I'm so glad you liked them!
216,Monica," Oh, well... um, that's all there are of these. But in about eight and a
half minutes, we'll be serving some delicious onion tartlets."
218,Rachel, Excuse me? Can I help you with anything?
222,Monica," (joining him and taking the taco shells) You know that? You don't want
to spoil your appetite."
224,Monica," You know, if you just wait another... six and a half minutes..."
226,Monica," No, we don't. (reaches for box) "
228,Monica," Why don't you just have a seat here? (he sits at the table, then tries
to secretly eat the Gummi-bears. Monica spots him.) OK... give me the Gummi-bears."
230,Monica, Give them to me.
232,Monica," No, give me the..."
234,Monica, (furious) That's it! Dinner is over!
236,Monica, What?
238,Monica," Why? It's just that I've waited seven years for an opportunity like
this, and you can't even wait four and a half minutes for a stupid onion tartlet?"
242,Joey, What a tool!
243,Rachel, You don't want to work for a guy like that.
244,Ross, Yeah!
245,Monica," I know... it's just... I thought this was, you know... it."
246,Ross," Look, you'll get there. You're an amazing chef."
247,Phoebe, Yeah! You know all those yummy noises? I wasn't faking.
249,Joey," (to Ross) So, er... how did it go with Celia?"
250,Ross," Oh, I was unbelievable."
251,Joey," All right, Ross!"
252,Ross," I was the James Michener of dirty talk. It was the most elaborate filth
you have ever heard. I mean, there were characters, plot lines, themes, a motif...
at one point there were villagers."
253,Joey, Whoa! And the... (gestures with hands) huh-huh?
254,Ross," Well, ahem... you know, by the time we'd finished with all the dirty talk,
it was kinda late... and we were both kind of exhausted, so uh..."
255,Joey, You cuddled.
256,Ross," Yeah, which was nice."
257,Phoebe, You guys wanna try and catch a late movie or something?
258,Rachel," Maybe, but shouldn't we wait for Chandler?"
259,Joey," Yeah, where the hell is he?"
261,Chandler," (on phone) Yes, Fran. I know what time it is, but I'm looking at the
WENUS and I'm not happy!... (Listens) Oh, really, really, really? Well, let me tell you
something... you will care about it, because I care about it! You got it? Good! (slams
phone down, then leans back and realizes what just happened) Whooooaaaa...."
263,Phoebe, How's this? (presses down hard)
265,Phoebe, Sorry. How about over here? (presses down hard again)
267,Phoebe," See, that just means it's working. Does this hurt? (presses down
elsewhere)"
269,Phoebe," What about this? (she starts using her elbows on his back, he yells in
pain)"
271,Phoebe," There you go! (She continues to work him over
with her elbows and he continues to yell in pain.)"

fell off the balcony and may have broken her foot or or ankle or something."
8,Rachel, Ow ow ow. Ow ow ow. Ow ow ow.
10,Monica," Okay, ooh, alright. Name, address... Okay, in case of emergency, call?"
11,Rachel, You.
12,Monica, Really?
13,Rachel, Yeah.
14,Monica," Oh, that is so sweet. (Touched, she puts an arm around her friend and
kisses her.) Oh gosh, love you. Insurance?"
15,Rachel," Oh, yeah, check it. Definitely, I want some of that."
16,Monica, (No longer touched) you don't have insurance?
17,Rachel," Why, how much is this gonna cost?"
18,Monica," I have no idea, but X-rays alone could be a couple hundred dollars."
19,Rachel, Wel-wel-well what are we gonna do?
20,Monica, Well there's not much we can do.
21,Rachel," (Like a big baby) Um... unless, unless I use yours."
22,Monica," Hah, no no no no no no no no no no."
23,Rachel," (Tapping the clipboard) well, now, wait a second, who did I just put as
my ""In case of emergency"" person?"
24,Monica," (Looking around to check that no-one's listening, then lowering her
voice anyway) That's insurance fraud."
25,Rachel," Well, alright, then, forget it. (Getting up to go) Might as well just go
home. Ow ow ow ow!"
26,Monica," (Jumping up to make Rachel sit down) Okay, okay. I hate this."
27,Rachel, Thank you. Thank you. I love you.
28,Monica," (to the nurse) Hi, (tiny laugh) um, I'm gonna need a new set of (tiny
laugh) these forms (tiny laugh)."
30,Monica," (Tiny laugh) I am really an idiot. (Tiny laugh) you see, I was filling
out my friend's form, and instead of putting her information, (tiny laugh) I put mine."
32,Monica," (Tiny laugh) yep, that's me, (tiny laugh) I am that stupid (tiny
laugh)."
34,Ross, I had a dream last night where I was playing football with my kid.
36,Ross," No, no, with him. (He mimes holding the baby like a football.) I'm
on this field, and they, they hike me the baby... and I, I know I've gotta do
something 'cause the Tampa Bay defence is comin' right at me."
37,Joey, Tampa Bay's got a terrible team.
38,Ross," Right, but, it is just me and the baby, so I'm thinkin' they can take us.
And so I uh, hah-hah, I just heave it down field."
39,Chandler, What are you crazy? That's a baby!
40,Joey, He should take the sack?
41,Ross," Anyway, suddenly I'm down field, and I realise that I'm the one
who's supposed to catch him, right? Only I know there is no way I'm gonna get there in
time, so I am running, and running, and that, that is when I woke up. See I, I am so
not ready to be a father."
42,Chandler," Hey, you're gonna be fine. You're one of the most caring, most
responsible men in North America. You're gonna make a great dad."
43,Joey," Yeah, Ross. You and the baby just need better blocking."
45,Joey," Oh, have either one of you guys ever been to the Rainbow Room? Is it real
expensive?"
46,Chandler," Well, only if you order stuff."
47,Joey, I'm takin' Ursula tonight. It's her birthday.
48,Ross, Wo-wo-whoa. What about Phoebe's birthday?
49,Joey, When's that?
50,Ross, Tonight.
51,Joey," Oh, man. What're the odds of that happening?"
53,Ross, You take your time.
55,Chandler, There it is! So what're you gonna do?
56,Joey," What can I do? Look, I don't want to do anything to screw it up with
Ursula."
57,Chandler, And your friend Phoebe?
58,Joey," Well, if she's my friend, hopefully she'll understand. I mean, wouldn't
you guys?"
59,Chandler," Man, if you tried something like that on my birthday, you'd be
starin' at the business end of a hissy fit."
65,Monica," Yes? (jumping as Rachel punches her arm) ..yes, she is."
71,Rachel, Aren't you a little cute to be a doctor?
73,Rachel," I meant er, (struggling to concentrate) young, young, I meant young,
young to be a doctor. Oh good, Rach."
77,Rachel," ..so, he said it was just a sprain, and that was it."
78,Monica," Uh, you left out the stupid part."
79,Rachel," Not stupid. The very cute, cute, cute doctors asked us out for tomorrow
night, and I said ""yes."""
80,Monica," I think it's totally insane, I mean, they work for the hospital. It's
like returning to the scene of the crime. You know, I say we blow off the dates."
81,Rachel," What? Monica, they are cute, they are doctors, (spelling it out in the
air for her slow friend) cute doctors, doctors who are cute!"
82,Chandler," Alright, what have we learned so far?"
86,Ross, What the hell are you doing? You scared the crap outta me.
87,Rachel, Was that the cake?
88,Ross," Yeah, yeah. I got a lemon schmush."
89,Monica," Come on, she'll be here any minute."
91,Rachel, I hope it's okay.
93,Monica, Oh...
94,Chandler," (Reading) ""Happy Birthday Peehe."""
95,Monica," Well maybe we can make a, a, a 'B' out of one of those roses."
97,Ross," (Still annoyed) Yeah, we'll just use our special cake tools."
98,Phoebe," Hey, what's going on?"
99,Ross," Oh, we just..."
101,Phoebe," (Delighted) oh, oh, oh! This is so great! Oh my god! This was not at all
scary. Hi everybody. Hi Betty! Betty, Hi! (Thrilled) You found Betty! Oh my god! (Hugging
people) This is great. Everybody I love is in the same room, (still happy) Where's Joey?"
103,Chandler, Did you see Betty?
107,Ross," Dad, before I was born, did you freak out at all?"
109,Ross," Dad, dad, dad, I'm talkin' about the whole uh, baby thing. Did you uh,
ever get this sort of... panicky, ""Oh my god I'm gonna be a father"" kind of a
thing?"
111,Ross," No, no, Dad, I was just wondering."
113,Ross," Thanks, Dad, really, I ju... you know, I just, I just needed to know,
um... when did you start to feel like a father?"
117,Ross," No, we can go to Williamsburg."
120,Monica," Rachel, the cute doctors are here."
121,Rachel," (entering from her room) Okay, coming!"
123,Monica," Hi, come on in."
125,Monica," Hi, Geoffrey."
126,Rachel, Hi.
129,Rachel," Oh, that's great. Look at that."
131,Monica, It's uh...
136,Rachel," Okay, listen, I'm thinking, why don't we just tell them who we really
are? I mean, it'll be fine, I really think it'll be fine."
137,Monica, It will not be fine. We'll get in trouble.
138,Rachel," Oh, Monica! Would you stop being such a wuss?"
139,Monica," A wuss? Excuse me for living in the real world, okay?"
147,Monica," I said we are not going to do it, okay? Sometimes you can be such a, a
big baby."
148,Rachel," (Resenting the truth) I am not a baby! You know what? I swear to
god, just because you get so uptight every time we..."
149,Monica," Sure, every time, you're such a princess..."
150,Rachel, You know what?
151,Monica, What?
152,Rachel, You know what?
153,Monica, What!?
154,Rachel, You know what?
155,Monica, (getting angry) What!!?
156,Rachel," Every day, you are becoming more and more like your mother."
158,Rachel, Hello! Here we go!
160,Rachel," (as Monica) Thanks! I've been here about six years, and Rachel moved in
a few months ago."
161,Monica," (as Rachel) Yeah... (joining the others) ..see, I was supposed to get
married, but, um, I left the guy at the altar."
164,Monica," (as Rachel) Yeah... Yeah, I know it's pretty selfish, but haha, hey,
that's me. (Indicating a dish on the table) Why don't you try the hummus?"
166,Rachel," (as Monica) Aahh, I'm a... chef at a restaurant uptown."
168,Rachel," (as Monica) Yeah it is, mostly because I get to boss people
around, which I just love to do."
171,Monica," (as Rachel) (Suddenly laughing) Oh, god, I am so spoiled... That's it!"
173,Rachel," (as Monica) And by the way, have I mentioned that back in high school, I
was a cow?"
174,Monica, (as Rachel) I used to wet my bed.
175,Rachel, (as Monica) I use my breasts to get other people's attention.
176,Monica," (as Rachel) (Revealing her anger to point at her best friend) We both
do that!"
179,Monica," (as Rachel) Hi, Dad. No, no, it's me. (Getting up to move further away
from Rachel) li-listen, Dad, I can't talk right now, um, but there's something, um...
there's something that I've been meaning to tell you..."
181,Rachel, Would you excuse me for a second?
182,Monica," (as Rachel) Remember back in freshman year? (Talking fast before Rachel
can catch her) Well, Billy Dreskin and I had sex on your bed."
186,Rachel," (on phone) Daddy... Daddy... Daddy, why whyyy would I sleep with Billy
Dreskin? His father tried to put you out of business! (Rachel turns to Monica, clasping
the receiver to her bosom so Dr.Green can't hear, while mouthing ""You are..."")
...dead!"
188,Monica," Ross, he's got the remote again."
189,Ross, Good. Maybe he can switch it back.
191,Ross, Maybe not.
193,Rachel," Hello? (Listens) Um, yeah, uh, (snapping her fingers at Ross who takes
the remote from Marcel, then turns off the TV) Okay ah, hold on a second, lemme lemme just
check and see if see if she's here."
195,Rachel," It's the woman from the hospital admissions office. She says there's a
problem with the form. Oh, god, oh god..."
197,Monica," I don't know! Why don't you just explain? What do they want? Find out
what they want!"
198,Rachel," Okay (desperately hands the receiver over) no, you do it."
199,Monica," (taking the phone) Hello, this is Monica... Yeah??? Oh... (Smiles at
Rachel to reassure her) Okay, yes, we'll be right, we'll be right down.(Listens) Thank
you. (Hangs up)"
200,Rachel, What?
201,Monica, We forgot to sign one of the admissions forms.
202,Rachel," Ohhh... (slumping in relief) Okay, you were right. You were right! This
was just not worth it."
203,Monica, Thank you.
204,Rachel," Okay, let me just change."
205,Monica, Yes.
207,Joey, (entering quietly) Hey.
209,Monica, Hi.
210,Phoebe, Trouble?
211,Joey, Your sister stood me up the other night.
212,Phoebe," Oh, no. Don't you hate it when people aren't there for
you?"
213,Ross, Well did you try calling her?
214,Joey," I've been trying for two days. When I called the restaurant, they said she
was too busy to talk. I can't believe she's blowin' me off."
217,Phoebe, Hey.
220,Phoebe," Um you, you got a minute?"
223,Phoebe, So.
226,Phoebe," Um, oh, I got you a birthday present."
230,Phoebe," Right, like the kind you..."
233,Phoebe, How'd you know I was coming?
236,Phoebe, I can't believe you did this.
238,Phoebe, I can't believe you... (holding up Joey's cardigan) ..did this.
240,Phoebe," So... What's the deal with umm, you and Joey?"
243,Phoebe, Does he know?
245,Phoebe," Joey. You know, um, he's really nutsy about you."
247,Phoebe, You got me.
252,Phoebe," So, um, are you gonna call him?"
254,Phoebe," No, Joey."
256,Phoebe, No. No food with a face.
259,Phoebe," Yeah, you too."
262,Rachel," (as Monica) Hi, remember us?"
264,Monica," (as Rachel) Um, okay. You just called a little while ago about needing a
signature on the admissions form. Well, it turns out we need a whole new one
(little laugh) because uh, you see, I-I, I put the wrong name again. (Little laugh) 'cause
um..."
266,Monica, (as Rachel) I am. I'm that stupid. (Little laugh.)
267,Rachel," (as Monica) Yeah, and and, I'm just gonna pay for this with a check."
269,Rachel," (as Monica) Yeah, I know... (mirroring her friend) ..I'm I'm just not
that bright either."
272,Chandler," Okay, worst case scenario. Say you never feel like a father."
273,Ross, Uh-huh.
274,Chandler," Say your son never feels connected to you, as one. Say all of his
relationships are affected by this."
275,Ross, Do you have a point?
276,Chandler," You know, you think I would."
278,Chandler, What's up with the simian?
279,Ross, It's just a fur ball.
280,Chandler, Okay... (returning to the board) ..whose turn is it?
281,Ross," Yours, I just got 43 points for 'KIDNEY'."
282,Chandler," No, no, you got zero points for 'IDNEY'."
283,Ross, I had a 'K'. Where's where's my 'K'?
286,Ross, You've got to help me my monkey swallowed a 'K'!
289,Ross," No, no you don't understand the animal hospital is way across town he's
choking I don't know what else to do."
290,Monica, What's goin' on?
292,Chandler, Marcel swallowed a Scrabble tile.
293,Rachel, Oh.
296,Ross," Lady, he is people. He has a name, okay? He watches Jeopardy!
He he touches himself when nobody's watching. Please, please have a heart!"
301,Monica, Michael.
303,Rachel, What?
304,Monica, (as Rachel) Monica.
305,Rachel, (as Monica) Oh.
306,Monica, (as Rachel) Hi.
307,Rachel, (as Monica) Hi.
310,Phoebe, (as Ursula) Hey.
311,Joey, Urse...
313,Joey," ..ah, what're you doing here? I've been trying to call you."
314,Phoebe," (as Ursula) Listen, um..."
315,Joey," No, no, no, don't say ""listen."" I know that ""listen.""
I've said that ""listen."""
316,Phoebe, (as Ursula) I'm sorry.
317,Joey," I don't get it. What happened? What about everything you said under the
bridge?"
319,Phoebe," (as Ursula) Yeah, um... (nervously clears her throat) You know you, you
should just forget about what I said under the bridge, I was talkin' crazy that
night, I was so drunk!"
320,Joey, You don't drink.
321,Phoebe," (as Ursula) That's right, I don't... But I was, I was drunk on you!"
322,Joey," Oh, Urse... (He tries to take her in his arms, but she fends him off.)"
323,Phoebe," (as Ursula) Okay, yeah, so it's not gonna work."
324,Joey, Why? Is it because I'm friends with Phoebe?
325,Phoebe," (as Ursula) If it was, would you stop hanging out with her?"
326,Joey," (Thinking carefully) no. No, I, I couldn't do that."
327,Phoebe," (as Ursula) Um, then yes, it's 'cause of Phoebe! So, you know, it's
either her or me."
328,Joey," Then, uh, then I'm sorry."
330,Phoebe," (as Ursula) You know... (unconsciously putting a hand on his knee)
You're gonna be really, really hard to get over."
331,Joey, I know...
333,Joey," I don't know whether it's just 'cause we're breakin' up or... what, but
you have never looked so beautiful."
334,Phoebe, Really?
336,Joey, Pheebs?
337,Phoebe, (Automatically) Yeah. Oooh... (she's sprung.)
339,Ross, He looks so tiny.
341,Joey, We just got the message.
342,Phoebe, Is he alright?
343,Ross, Yeah. The doctor got the 'K' out. He also found an 'M' and an 'O'.
344,Chandler, We think he was trying to spell out 'MONKEY.'
346,Ross," Well, the doctor says he's gonna be fine, he's just sleeping now."
347,Chandler," (Tapping Ross on his shoulder) So, you feel like a dad yet?"
348,Ross," No, why?"
349,Chandler," Hey, come on, you came through, you did what you had to do. That is
very dad."
351,Monica," Oh, look, he's waking up!"
352,Ross," (Quietly) hey, fella! How you doing?"
356,Ross, Aqui está. (Here it is!)
357,Monica," ¿A quién pidio el pollo General Tso? (Who ordered General Sal's
chicken?)"
358,Chandler, ¡Pudo aver sido General Tso! (It could've been General Sal!)
360,Rachel," ¡Mira, mira, el viejo desnudo está haciendo el hula hoop! (Look, look,
Ugly Naked Guy is doing the hula!)"
365,Joey," ¡Hola, amigos! (Hey, everybody!)"
367,Monica," Mira, Ross, Marcel se llevo el control remoto. (Look, Ross, Marcel's got
the remote.)"
368,Ross," ¡Lo que sucedio es que no le gusta la tele! (The thing is, he doesn`t
like the program!)"
0,Ross," Uh, Rach, we're running low on resumes over here."
1,Monica, Do you really want a job with Popular Mechanics?
2,Chandler," Well, if you're gonna work for mechanics, those are the ones to work
for."
3,Rachel," Hey, look, you guys, I'm going for anything here, OK? I cannot be a
waitress anymore, I mean it. I'm sick of the lousy tips, I'm sick of being called 'Excuse
me...'"
4,Ross," Rach, did you proofread these?"
5,Rachel," Uh... yeah, why?"
6,Ross," Uh, nothing, I'm sure they'll be impressed with your excellent compuper
skills."
7,Rachel," (upset) Oh my Goood! Oh, do you think it's on all of them?"
8,Joey," Oh no, I'm sure the Xerox machine caught a few."
11,Monica," Hey, guys."
13,Rachel," Hey... hi, ladies... uh, can I get you anything? (to Monica, quietly)
Did you bring the mail?"
14,Monica, Lots of responses.
15,Rachel," (to Monica) Really? (out loud) Sure, we have scones left! (to Monica)
OK, read them to me."
16,Phoebe," (reading) Dear Ms. Green, thank you for your inquiry, however... oh...
(crumples up letter)"
17,Rachel, (out loud) We have apple cinnamon...
18,Monica," (reading) OK... Dear Ms. Green... yeah... yeah... yeah... No. (crumpes
up letter)"
19,Phoebe, Wow!
20,Rachel, What?
21,Phoebe, (reading) Your Visa bill is huge!
22,Rachel, (grabs the bill) Give me that!
24,Chandler," You know, I can't believe you. Linda is so great! Why won't you go out
with her again?"
25,Ross, I don't know.
26,Chandler," Is this still about her whole 'The Flintstones could've really
happened' thing?"
27,Ross," No, it's not just that. It's just—I want someone who... who does
something for me, y'know? Who gets my heart pounding, who... who makes me, uh... (begins
to stare lovingly at Rachel)"
28,Chandler, ...little playthings with yarn?
29,Ross, What?
30,Chandler, Could you want her more?
31,Ross, Who?
32,Chandler," (sarcastically) Dee, the sarcastic sister from Whats Happening."
33,Ross," Look, I am totally, totally over her, OK, I just... (Rachel comes over,
Ross lays head on table) Hiiii!"
34,Rachel, Hi! How are you?
35,Ross," We're fine, we're fine."
36,Rachel, OK. (walks away) 
38,Joey, Shut up!
39,Chandler, We're not—we're not saying anything.
40,Phoebe, What?
41,Ross, Uhhhh... Joey cried last night.
42,Joey, Thank you.
43,Chandler," (to the girls) We were playing poker, alright..."
44,Joey," There was chocolate on the three. It looked like an eight, alright?"
45,Ross," Oh, guys, you should've seen him. 'Read 'em and weep.'"
46,Chandler, And then he did.
47,Rachel," Well, now, how come you guys have never played poker with us?"
48,Phoebe," Yeah, what is that? Like, some kind of guy thing? Like, some kind of
sexist guy thing? Like it's poker, so only guys can play?"
49,Ross," No, women are welcome to play."
50,Phoebe," Oh, OK, so then what is it? Some kind of... you know, like, like... some
kind of, y'know, like... alright, what is it?"
51,Chandler, There just don't happen to be any women in our games.
52,Joey," Yeah, we just don't happen to know any women that know how to play poker."
54,Monica," Oh, please, that is such a lame excuse!"
55,Rachel, Really.
56,Monica," I mean, that's a typical guy response."
57,Ross," Excuse me, do any of you know how to play?"
59,Rachel, But you could teach us.
62,Chandler," (teaching) OK, so now we draw cards."
63,Monica," So I wouldn't need any, right? Cause I have a straight."
64,Rachel," Oh, good for you!"
65,Phoebe, Congratulations!
67,Chandler," OK Phoebs, how many do you want?"
68,Phoebe," OK, I just need two... the, um, ten of spades and the six of clubs."
69,Ross," No. No, uh, Phoebs? You can't—you can't do..."
70,Rachel," Oh wait, I have the ten of spades! Here! (gives it to Phoebe)"
71,Ross,
72,Rachel," Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no, that's OK, I don't need them. I'm going for
fours."
73,Ross," Oh, you're... (gives up)"
75,Monica," Alright, here we go. We've got salmon roulettes and assorted crudites."
77,Joey," Whoa, whoa, whoa, Monica, what're you doin'? This is a poker game. You
can't serve food with more than one syllable. It's gotta be like chips, or dip, or
pretz...(look of realization)"
78,Chandler," (changing subject) OK, so at this point, the dealer..."
79,Monica," Alright, you know, we got it, we got it. Let's play for real. High
stakes... big bucks..."
80,Ross," Alright, now, you sure? Phoebe just threw away two jacks because they
didn't look happy..."
81,Phoebe," But... I'm ready, so, just deal."
82,Chandler," OK, alright, last minute lesson, last minute lesson. (holds up two
cards) Joey... three... eight. Eight... three. (Joey is unamused) Alright babe, deal the
cards."
84,Monica," (throws down her cards) Dammit, dammit, dammit!"
85,Phoebe," (to Joey) Oh I see, so then, you were lying."
86,Joey, About what?
87,Phoebe, About how good your cards were.
88,Joey, Heh... I was bluffing.
89,Phoebe, A-ha! And... what is bluffing? Is it not another word for... lying?
90,Rachel," OK, sorry to break up this party, but I've got resumes to fax before
work tomorrow... (gets up to leave)"
92,Chandler," Rach, Rach, we gotta settle."
93,Rachel, Settle what?
94,Chandler," The... Jamestown colony of Virginia. You see, King George is giving us
the land, so..."
95,Ross," The game, Rachel, the game. You owe us money for the game."
96,Rachel, Oh. Right.
97,Joey," You know what, you guys? It's their first time, why don't we just forget
about the money, alright?"
98,Monica," Hell no, we'll pay!"
99,Phoebe," OK, Monica? I had another answer all ready."
100,Monica, And you know what? We want a rematch.
101,Ross, Well that's fine with me. Could use the money.
102,Rachel," (to Ross) So basically, you get your ya-yas by taking money from all of
your friends."
103,Ross, (pause)...Yeah.
104,Chandler," Yes, and I get my ya-yas from Ikea. You have to put them
together yourself, but they cost a little less."
105,Ross," Look, Rachel, this is poker. I play to win, alright? In order for me to
win, other people have to lose. So if you're gonna play poker with me, don't expect me to
be a 'nice guy,' OK? Cause once those cards are dealt... (claps hands three times)"
106,Joey, (pause)...Yeah?
107,Ross, I'm not a nice guy.
109,Ross," Alright boys, let's eat."
110,Chandler," Oh, did you get that from the 'I Love Rachel' pizzeria?"
111,Ross, You still on that?
112,Chandler," Oh, come on. What was with that whole Black Bart speech? (mimicking)
""When I play poker, I'm not a nice guy!"""
113,Ross," You are way off, pal."
114,Joey," No, I don't think so, see Ross, because I think you love her."
115,Ross," Um.... no. See, I might've had feelings for her at one time—not any
more. I just—I..."
117,Ross, Marcel! Where are you going with that disc?
119,Ross," You are not putting that on again! Marcel, OK—if you press that
button, you are in very, very big trouble."
122,Rachel, (opening mail) Can you believe what a jerk Ross was being?
123,Monica," Yeah, I know. He can get really competitive."
124,Phoebe," Ha. Ha, ha."
125,Monica, What?
126,Phoebe," Oh, hello, kettle? This is Monica. You're black."
127,Monica, Please! I am not as bad as Ross.
128,Rachel," Oh, I beg to differ. The Pictionary incident?"
129,Monica," That was not an incident! I-I was gesturing, a-and the plate
slipped out of my hand."
130,Rachel," Oooooh. (reads letter) (surprised) Oh! I got an interview! I got an
interview!"
131,Monica, You're kidding! Where? Where?
132,Rachel, (in disbelief) Sak's... Fifth... Avenue.
133,Monica," Oh, Rachel!"
134,Phoebe," Oh, it's like the mother ship is calling you home."
135,Monica," Well, what's the job?"
136,Rachel, Assistant buyer. Oh! I would be shopping... for a living!
138,Monica," OK, look. That is Aunt Iris. This woman has been playing poker since she
was five. You gotta listen to every word she says. (opens door) Hi!"
140,Rachel, No.
141,Monica, I don't think so.
142,Rachel, Why?
144,Monica, What?
145,Rachel, Oh my God!
146,Monica, Really?
148,Phoebe, Thank y... (thinks about it)
150,Monica," Uh, Aunt Iris? This is Phoebe, and that's Rachel..."
153,Phoebe," Ross, could we please, please, please listen to anything else?"
154,Ross, Alright.
156,Ross, I'm gonna pay for that tonight.
158,Rachel, Hi!
159,Ross, Hey.
160,Rachel," Guys! Guess what, guess what, guess what, guess what!"
161,Chandler," Um, ok... the... the fifth dentist caved and now they're all
recommending Trident?"
162,Rachel," Noooo... the interview! She loved me! She absolutely loved me. We talked
for like two and a half hours, we have the same taste in clothes, and—oh, I went to
camp with her cousin... And, oh, the job is perfect. I can do this. I can do this well!"
164,Rachel," Oh God, oh, and then she told the funniest story..."
165,Monica," OK, great. You'll tell us and we'll laugh. Let's play poker."
166,Joey," Alright now listen, you guys, we talked about it, and if you don't want to
play, we completely understand."
167,Chandler," Oh yes, yes, we could play some other game... like, uh, I don't
know... Pictionary?"
169,Monica," Ha, ha, very funny, very funny. But I think we'd like to give poker
another try. Shall we, ladies?"
171,Ross," Uh, Rach, do you want me to shuffle those?"
172,Rachel," No, no, thats OK. Y'know, I think I'm gonna give it a go."
173,Ross, Alright.
174,Rachel," Alright... (shuffles cards expertly, all the guys stare in amazement)"
177,Ross," So, Phoebs owes $7.50, Monica, you owe $10, and Rachel, you owe fifteen
big ones."
178,Joey," But hey, thanks for teachin' us Cross-Eyed Mary. You guys, we gotta play
that at our regular game."
179,Phoebe," Alright, here's my $7.50. (Hands them the money) But I think you should
know that this money is cursed."
180,Joey, What?
181,Phoebe," Oh, I cursed it. So now bad things will happen to he who spends it."
182,Chandler," That's alright, I'll take it. Bad things happen to me anyway. This way
I can break 'em up with a movie."
183,Ross," Well, that just leaves the big Green poker machine, who owes fifteen..."
184,Rachel," Mmm-hmmm. Oh, so typical. Ooo, I'm a man. Ooo, I have a penis. Ooo, I
have to win money to exert my power over women. (hands over her money)"
185,Monica," You know what? This is not over. We will play you again, and we will
win, and you will lose, and you will beg, and we will laugh, and we will take every last
dime you have, and you will hate yourselves forever."
186,Rachel," Hmm. Kinda stepped on my point there, Mon."
188,Ross," So, you gals wanna hand over your money now? That way, we don't have to go
through the formality of actually playing."
189,Rachel," Ooooh, that's fine. We'll see who has the last laugh there, monkey boy."
190,Monica," OK, we done with the chit-chat? Are we ready to play some serious poker?"
191,Phoebe," (holding a card and waving it in front of her face) Hey you guys, look,
the one-eyed jack follows me wherever I go. (they look at her) Right, OK, serious poker."
193,Monica," Excuse me, where are you going?"
194,Ross, Uh... to the bathroom.
195,Monica," Do you want to go to the bathroom, or do you wanna play poker?"
196,Ross, I want to go to the bathroom. (exits)
197,Joey," Alright, well, I'm gonna order a pizza. (gets up)"
198,Rachel," Oh no-no-no-no-no, I'm still waiting to hear from that job and the store
closes at nine, so you can eat then."
199,Joey, That's fine. I'll just have a Tic-Tac to hold me over.
200,Monica," Alright, Cincinnati, no blinds, everybody ante. (deals cards)"
201,Phoebe, (looks at her cards) Yes! (everyone looks at her) .... or no.
203,Ross," Alright. (to Rachel) Your money's mine, Green."
204,Rachel," Your fly is open, Geller. (he checks it, and zips up)"
206,Phoebe," You guys, you know what I just realized? 'Joker' is 'poker' with a 'J.'
Coincidence?"
207,Chandler," Hey, that's... that's 'joincidence' with a 'C'!"
208,Joey, Uh... Phoebe? Phoebe?
209,Phoebe, Yeah. Um... I'm out. (throws in cards)
210,Rachel, I'm in.
211,Monica, Me too.
212,Joey," Me too. Alright, whattaya got."
213,Ross," Well, you better hop outta the shower, cause... I gotta flush. (lays down
cards)"
214,Rachel," Well, well, well, hop back in bucko, cause I got four sixes! (lays down
cards) I won! I actually won! Oh my God! Y'know what? (collects chips) I think I'm gonna
make a little Ross pile. (holds up a chip) I think that one was Ross's, and I
think—oh—that one was Ross's. Yes! (Starts singing) Well, I have got your
money, and you'll never see it..."
216,Rachel, And your fly's still open...
218,Rachel," Ha, I made you look.... "
220,Rachel, I couldn't be inner. Monica?
221,Phoebe," Monica, in or out?"
222,Monica, (slams down cards) I hate this game! 
224,Phoebe," OK Joey, your bet."
225,Joey," Ahhh, I fold like a cheap hooker who got hit in the stomach by a fat guy
with sores on his face. (the girls look at him, confused) Oh, I'm out."
226,Phoebe, Ross?
227,Ross," Oh, I am very in."
228,Phoebe, Chandler?
229,Chandler, Couldn't be more out. (throws in cards)
230,Phoebe, Me too. Rachel.
231,Rachel," Uh, I will see you... and I'll raise you. (throws chips in pot) What do
you say... want to waste another buck?"
232,Ross," No, not this time. (he folds) So... what'd you have?"
233,Rachel, I'm not telling. (collects chips)
234,Ross," Come on, show them to me. (reaches for her cards, Rachel covers them up)"
235,Rachel, No..!
236,Ross, Show them to me!
237,Rachel, Get your hands out of there! No!
238,Ross, Let me see! Show them!
239,Chandler," Y'know, I've had dates like this."
240,Rachel," (deals new hand) Boy, you really can't stand to lose, can you? Your
whole face is getting red... little veins popping out on your temple..."
241,Phoebe, Plus that shirt doesn't really match those pants.
243,Ross," First of all, I'm not losing..."
244,Rachel," Oh, you are losing. Definitely losing. (phone rings)"
245,Ross, Let's not talk about losing. Just deal the...
246,Rachel," (answering phone) Hel-lo, Rachel Green."
247,Ross," (mimicking Rachel) Mee mee, mee-mee mee."
248,Rachel, (on phone) Excuse me. (covers up phone; to Ross) It's about the job.
250,Rachel," Barbara! Hi, how are you? (Listens) Uh-huh. (Listens) No, I understand.
Yeah. Oh, oh, come on, no, I'm fine. Don't be silly. Yeah... oh, but you know, if-if
anything else opens up, plea—Hello? Hello? (hangs up phone, very depressed)"
252,Monica," Sorry, Rach."
253,Phoebe," Y'know, there's gonna be lots of other stuff."
254,Rachel," Yeah...(sigh)....OK. Where were we? Oh, OK... five card draw, uh...
jacks or better... nothing wild, everybody ante."
255,Joey," Look, Rachel, we don't have to do this."
256,Rachel," Yes, we do. (pause)"
257,Monica," Alright, check."
258,Joey, Check.
259,Ross, I'm in for fifty cents. (throws it in)
260,Chandler, Call.
261,Phoebe, I'm in.
262,Rachel," I see your fifty cents... and I raise you... five dollars. (throws it
in)"
263,Ross," I thought, uh... it was a fifty cent limit."
264,Rachel," Well, I just lost a job, and I'd like to raise the bet five bucks. Does
anybody have a problem with that?"
266,Rachel, (to Ross) Loser?
268,Ross," No, I fold. (lays cards down, and gets up)"
269,Rachel," What do you mean, you fold? Hey, come on! What is this? I thought that
'once the cards were dealt, I'm not a nice guy.' I mean, what, were you just full of it?"
271,Ross, I'm in. (throws in chips)
272,Rachel, How many you want?
273,Ross, One. (Rachel gives him the card.)
274,Rachel, Dealer takes two. (she deals herself two cards) What do you bet?
275,Ross, I bet two dollars. (throws it in)
276,Rachel, OK... see your two... and I raise you twenty. (throws it in)
277,Ross," I see your twenty, raise you twenty-five. (throws it in)"
279,Rachel," See your twenty-five...and...uh, Monica, get my purse."
281,Monica," Rachel, there's nothing in it."
282,Rachel," OK, then get me your purse."
284,Monica," OK, here you go. Good luck."
285,Rachel," (to Monica) Thank you. (to Ross) I saw your twenty-five, and I raise
you... seven."
286,Phoebe, ...teen! (throws in a ten-dollar bill)
288,Ross," (to Joey) Joey, I'm a little shy."
289,Joey," That's OK, Ross, you can ask me. What?"
291,Chandler," (to Ross) What do you need, what do you need?"
292,Ross, Fifteen.
293,Chandler," Alright, here's ten. (gives it to him)"
294,Joey," Here, I got five, I got five. (Ross takes the money)"
295,Ross, Thank you.
296,Chandler, Good luck.
297,Ross," (to Rachel) OK, I am calling your seventeen. What do you got?"
299,Rachel, (lays down cards) Full house.
301,Ross, You got me.
303,Joey," (to Ross) Ahhh, that's alright. Y'know, that's a tough hand to beat."
304,Chandler, (to Ross) I thought we had them!
305,Ross," Oh, well, when you don't have the cards, you don't have the cards, you
know. (looks at Rachel) But, uh... look how happy she is. (smiles)"
309,Chandler," Airplane! Airport! Airport '75! Airport
'77! Airport '79!"
311,Rachel," Oh, time's up."
312,Monica," (pointing at the drawing, upset) Bye... bye... BIRDIE."
313,Joey, Oh!
314,Phoebe, That's a bird?
316,Phoebe, That's a bird!
318,Rachel," OK, OK, it's my turn. (reads the answer)"
319,Chandler, Go.
321,Ross, Uh.... bean! Bean!
323,Joey, (triumphantly) The Unbearable Likeness of Being!
324,Rachel, Yes!
325,Monica," That, you get? That, you get?"
1,Rachel," Okay, okay, I checked. We have Earl Grey, English Breakfast, Cinnamon
Stick, Camomile, Mint Medley, Blackberry, and.. oh, wait, there's one more, um.. Lemon
Soother. You're not the guy that asked for the tea, are you? (Guy shakes his head) Okay."
4,Monica," Mail call, Rachel Green, bunk seven."
5,Rachel," Thank you. (Examines it) Oh, cool! Free sample of coffee!"
6,Monica, Oh good! 'Cause where else would we get any?
7,Rachel, Oh. Right. ...Oh great.
8,Monica, What is it?
9,Rachel," Country club newsletter. My mother sends me the engagement notices for
'inspiration.' Oh my God! Oh my God, it's Barry and Mindy!"
10,Monica, Barry who you almost...?
11,Rachel, Barry who I almost.
12,Monica," And Mindy, your maid of...?"
13,Rachel," Mindy, my maid of. Oh!"
14,Monica," (Takes it) That's Mindy? Wow, she is pretty. (Sees Rachel's look) Lucky.
To have had a friend like you."
16,Ross," Marcel. Bring me the rice, c'mon. Bring me the rice, c'mon. Good boy. Good
boy. C'mere, gimme the rice. (Marcel brings the rice) Thank you, good boy. Well, I see
he's finally mastered the difference between 'bring me the' and 'pee in the'. (Rachel
ignores him) 'Bring me the' and- Rach?"
17,Rachel, What?
18,Ross, Hi.
19,Rachel," Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, this is so stupid! I mean, I gave Barry up, right? I
should be happy for them! I am, I'm happy for them."
20,Ross, Really.
21,Rachel," No. Oh, oh, I guess it would be different if I were- with somebody."
22,Ross," Whoah, uh, what happened to, uh, 'Forget relationships! I'm done with
men!' The whole, uh, penis embargo?"
23,Rachel," Oh, I don't know. I guess it's not about no guys, it's about the right
guy, y'know? I mean, with Barry, it was safe and it was easy, but there was no heat. With
Paolo, that's all there was, was heat! And it was just this raw, animal, sexual..."
24,Ross," Wait-wait. I, I got it. I was there."
25,Rachel," Well, I mean, do you think you can ever have both? Y'know? Someone who's
like, who's like your best friend, but then also can make your toes curl?"
26,Ross," Yes. Yes. Yes! Yes, I really do! In fact, it's funny, very often, someone
who you wouldn't think could-could curl your toes, might just be the one who..."
28,Monica, Hi.
29,Ross, ...Gets interrupted. Hi!
30,Rachel," Hi, how was the movie?"
31,Monica, Wonderful!
32,Phoebe, So good!
33,Joey, Suck-fest.
34,Chandler, Toootal chick-flick.
35,Phoebe," I-I'm sorry it wasn't one of those movies with, like, y'know, guns and
bombs and, like, buses going really fast..."
36,Joey," Hey, I don't need violence to enjoy a movie. Just so long as there's a
little nudity."
37,Monica, There was nudity!
38,Joey," I meant female nudity. Alright? I don't need to see Lou
Grant frolicking."
40,Ross," Alright, I've gotta go. C'mon, Marcel! C'mon! We're gonna go take a bath.
Yes we are, aren't we? Yes, we are."
41,Chandler," They're still just friends, right?"
42,Rachel, (To Marcel) And I will see you tomorrow!
43,Ross," That's right, you're gonna spend tomorrow at Aunt Rachel's, aren't you."
44,Monica," Oh, hang on, hang on. Does Aunt Monica get a say in this?"
45,Ross," 'Pwease, Aunt Monica, pwease?' Oh, unclench. You're not even gonna be
there."
47,Chandler, I can't believe we are even having this discussion.
48,Joey," I agree. I'm, like, in disbelief."
49,Chandler," I mean, don't you think if things were gonna happen with Rachel, they
would've happened already?"
50,Ross," I'm telling you, she said she's looking for a relationship with someone
exactly like me."
51,Joey, She really said that?
52,Ross," Well, I added the 'exactly like me' part... But she said she's looking for
someone, and someone is gonna be there tonight."
53,Joey, 'Tonight' tonight?
54,Ross," Well, I think it's perfect. Y'know, it's just gonna be the two of us, she
spent all day taking care of my monkey..."
55,Chandler, I can't remember the last time I got a girl to take care of my monkey.
56,Ross," Anyway, I figured after work I'd go pick up a bottle of wine, go over
there and, uh, try to woo her."
57,Chandler," Hey, y'know what you should do? You should take her back to the
1890's, when that phrase was last used."
59,Rachel," Now, now the one in the feather boa, that's Dr. Francis. Now, she used
to be a man. Okay, now look, see, there's Raven. We hate her. We're glad she's dying.
Okay- (Marcel pushes down a cushion to reveal a shoe) Wh- wh- Marcel, are you playing with
Monica's shoes? You know you're not supposed to pl- whoah. Marcel, did you poo in the
shoe? (Takes the shoe into the kitchen) Marcel, bad monkey! Oh! Oh! (She notices the
newsletter and taps the contents of the shoes onto it, then folds it shut) Sorry, Barry.
Little engagement gift. I'm sure you didn't register for that. (She leaves the apartment
holding the newsletter at arm's length. However, she leaves the door open. Marcel runs out
in the opposite direction. There is a shot from the TV and Rachel runs back in) Who died?
Who died? Roll him over! Oh, c'mon, roll him over! Oh...! Well, we know it wasn't Dexter,
right Marcel? Because- (Looks down and notices he is missing) Marcel? Marc- (Notices the
open door)"
61,Joey, How could you lose him?
62,Rachel," I don't know. We were watching TV, and then he pooped in Monica's shoe-"
63,Monica, Wait. He pooped in my shoe? Which one?
64,Rachel, I don't know. The left one.
65,Monica, Which ones?
66,Rachel," Oh. Oh, those little clunky Amish things you think go with everything."
67,Phoebe, (Entering) Hey. 
69,Phoebe," Whoah, ooh, why is the air in here so negative?"
70,Chandler, Rachel lost Marcel.
71,Phoebe," Oh no, how?"
72,Monica, He- he pooped in my shoe.
73,Phoebe, Which one?
74,Monica, Those cute little black ones I wear all the time.
75,Phoebe," No, which one? The right or left? 'Cause the left one
is lucky..."
76,Rachel," C'mon, you guys, what're we gonna do, what're we gonna do?"
77,Joey," Alright alright. You're a monkey. You're loose in the city. Where do you
go?"
78,Chandler," Okay, it's his first time out, so he's probably gonna wanna do some of
the touristy things. I'll go to Cats, you go to the Russian Tea Room."
79,Rachel," Oh, my, God, c'mon, you guys! He's gonna be home any minute! He's gonna
kill me!"
80,Monica," Okay, we'll start with the building. You guys take the first and second
floor, Phoebe and I'll take third and fourth."
81,Rachel," Well, what'm I gonna do? What'm I gonna do?"
82,Monica," Okay, you stay here, and just wait by the phone. Spray Lysol in
my shoe, and wait for Ross to kill you."
84,Rachel, Anybody wanna trade? Oh...
87,Monica," Mr. Heckles, our friend lost a monkey. Have you seen it?"
89,Monica, No!
90,Phoebe, Why would you leave your Belgian waffle in the hall?
92,Monica, A monkey. Have you seen a monkey?
94,Phoebe," Okay, thank you, Mr. Heckles. (They move off)"
97,Rachel," (On the phone) Okay, he's a, he's a black capuchian monkey with a white
face... (Enter Ross) ...with, with Russian dressing and, and pickles on the side. Okay.
Thanks."
98,Ross," Hey. How did, uh, how'd it go today?"
99,Rachel," Great! It went great. Really great. Hey, is that wine?"
100,Ross," Yeah. You, uh, you want some?"
101,Rachel," Oh, I would love some. But y'know what? Y'know what? Let's not drink it
here. I'm feeling kinda crazy. You wanna go to Newark?"
102,Ross," Uh, okay, yeah, we could do that, but before we head off to the murder
capital of the North-East, I was, uh, kinda wanting to run something by you. Y'know how we
were, uh, y'know, talking before about, uh, relationships and stuff? (Uncorks the wine)
Well-"
103,Rachel," Oh God, Ross, I cannot do this."
104,Ross," Okay, quick and painful. (Starts to cork the wine) "
105,Rachel," Oh God... Okay. Alright. Alright. Okay. Ross, please don't hate me."
106,Ross," Oh, what? What-what?"
107,Rachel, Y'know Marcel?
108,Ross, ...Yeah?
109,Rachel," Well, I kind of... I kind of lost him."
113,Ross," (Angry) I- I- I ca- I can't believe this. I mean, all I asked you to do
was keep him in the apartment."
114,Rachel," I know, I know, I'm sorry-"
115,Ross," No, y'know what, I guess it's partially my fault. Y'know, I shouldn't've,
uh, asked you to start off with a monkey. I should've started you off with like a pen or a
pencil."
116,Rachel," (Tearfully) Ross, I'm doing everything that I can, I've got everybody
looking for him, and I- (Door buzzer goes and she runs to get it) Oh! Who is it?"
118,Rachel, See? I've even called Animal Control!
119,Ross, You called Animal Control?
120,Rachel, Uh-huh... why... do you not like them?
121,Ross," Marcel is an illegal exotic animal. I'm not allowed to
have him in the city. If they find him, they'll take him away from me."
122,Rachel," O-okay, now see, you never ever ever told us that..."
123,Ross," That's right, I.. 'cause I didn't expect you were gonna invite them to the
apartment!"
125,Rachel," Hi, thanks for coming."
127,Rachel," Oh, y'know what? That was a complete misunderstanding! (Ross puts his
arms around her and they act all sweetness and light)"
128,Ross," Yeah, we thought we had a monkey, but we-we didn't."
129,Rachel, Turned out it was a hat.
130,Ross, Cat!
131,Rachel, Cat! What'm I saying? Cat!
133,Monica," Hi. We checked the third and fourth floor, no-one's seen Marcel."
135,Ross, My uncle Marcel.
136,Phoebe," Oh, is that who the monkey's named after?"
138,Phoebe, Oh my God. You'd put that poor little creature in jail?
139,Monica," Pheebs, you remember how we talked about saying things quietly to
yourself first?"
140,Phoebe," Yes, but there isn't always time!"
141,Monica," Look. I'm sure there's some friendly way to reconcile this! Um, have a
seat. First of all, we haven't been introduced, I'm Monica Geller."
143,Rachel, Yeah!
145,Rachel, Luisa? Oh my God! Monica! It's Luisa!
146,Monica, The Luisa from home room!
147,Rachel, Yes!!
149,Monica," No, none at all."
150,Rachel, None.
152,Monica," Oh, I'm- I'm so sorry!"
154,Rachel, What?!
155,Monica," Be that as it may, d'you think you could just help us out here on that
monkey thing? Y'know, just for old times' sake? Go Bobcats?"
157,Phoebe, Dun-dun-duuuur! Sorry.
159,Chandler, Marcel?
160,Joey, Marcel?
161,Chandler, Marcel?
162,Joey, Marcel?
166,Chandler," Um, we're kind of having an emergency and we-we were looking for
something..."
167,Joey, A monkey.
168,Chandler, Yes have you seen any?
170,Joey," Um, sure! Did you, uh, did you try turning the knob back the other way?"
172,Joey," Oh. Then, no."
177,Chandler," Oh, nononowaitwaitwaitnono! Uh... we may not know anything about
radiators per se, but we do have a certain amount of expertise in the heating and
cooling... mileu."
178,Joey," Uh, aren't we kind of in the middle of something here?"
179,Chandler," Yes, but these women are very hot, and they need our help! And they're
very hot."
180,Joey," We can't, alright? (To the women) We're sorry. You have no idea how sorry,
but... We promised we'd find this monkey. If you see him, he's about yea high and answers
to the name Marcel, so if we could get some pictures of you, you'd really be helping us
out."
182,Chandler," Okay, from now on, you don't get to talk to other people."
183,Joey, Marcel?
184,Chandler, Marcel?!
186,Phoebe, Marcel?
187,Monica, Marcel?
188,Phoebe, Marcel?
190,Phoebe, Oh-my-God!
191,Monica, Whaaat!
192,Phoebe, Something just brushed up against my right leg!
193,Monica, What is it?
194,Phoebe," Oh, it's okay, it was just my left leg."
196,Monica," Look, Phoebe!"
197,Phoebe," Yeah! Oh, c'mere, Marcel! Oh, Marcel, c'mere!"
200,Monica, What're you gonna do?
203,Monica," Run, Marcel, run! Run, Marcel! (Marcel runs off and Luisa runs after
him. Monica goes to check up on Phoebe) Are you okay?"
204,Phoebe," Yeah, think so. Oh! (She notices the tranquiliser dart has hit her in
the butt and removes it) Huh. (Sways back) Whoah."
205,Monica, Oh gosh.
207,Ross, Marcel?
208,Rachel, Marcel?
209,Ross," Marc- oh, this is ridiculous! We've been all over the neighbourhood. He's
gone, he's-he's just gone."
210,Rachel," Ross, you don't know that."
211,Ross," Oh come on. It's cold, it's dark, he doesn't know the Village. (Kicks a
sign in frustration) And now I have a broken foot. I have no monkey, and a broken foot!
Thank you very much."
212,Rachel," Ross, I said I'm sorry like a million times. What do you want me to do?
You want me to break my foot too? Okay, I'm gonna break my foot, right here. (Kicks the
sign) Ow!! Oh! Oh my God, oh my God! There, are you happy now?!"
213,Ross," Yeah, yeah. Y'know, now that you kicked the sign, hey! I don't miss Marcel
any more!"
214,Rachel," Y'know, it is not like I did this on purpose."
215,Ross," Oh, no no no. Nono, this is just vintage Rachel. I mean, things just sort
of happen around you. I mean, you're off in Rachel-land, doing your Rachel-thing, totally
oblivious to people's monkeys, or to people's feelings..."
216,Rachel, Ross.
217,Ross," I don't even wanna hear it, you're just..."
218,Rachel, Ross.
219,Ross," Oh, forget it, okay?"
220,Rachel, Ross!
221,Ross, What? What?
225,Phoebe," Oh, this is so intense. One side of my butt is totally asleep, and the
other side has no idea."
227,Ross," Hi, did you order some bananas?"
229,Ross, Gimme back my monkey.
231,Rachel, Then what's with all the bananas?
234,Ross," Marcel? Marcel? Okay, where is he? Where is he? Marcel? Marcel?"
236,Ross, Marcel! What've you done to him?
238,Ross," Are you insane? C'mere, Marcel, c'mon. (Marcel starts to go to him)"
240,Ross," C'mere, Marcel. (Turns to Ross)"
243,Ross," Okay, gimme my monkey back."
247,Ross," Alright, I want my monkey."
249,Rachel," Oh, c'mon, Luisa!"
251,Ross," (To Rachel) You had to be a bitch in high school, you couldn't've been
fat."
252,Rachel," Alright. In high school I was the prom queen and I was the homecoming
queen and the class president and you... were also there! But if you take this monkey, I
will lose one of the most important people in my life. You can hate me if you want, but
please do not punish him. C'mon, Luisa, you have a chance to be the bigger person here!
Take it!"
254,Rachel," Alright. Well then how about I call your supervisor, and I tell her that
you shot my friend in the ass with a dart?"
256,Ross," It'll be nice to get this off finally, won't it? Yes it will. (Marcel
resists) Or we can leave it on for now, that's fine."
257,Rachel," Y'know, with the right pair of pumps, that would be a great little
outfit."
258,Ross," Listen, I'm- I'm sorry I was so hard on you before, it's just I..."
259,Rachel," Oh, Ross, c'mon. It's my fault, I almost lost your..."
260,Ross," Yeah, but you were the one who got him back, y'know? You, you were great.
...Hey, we uh, we still have that, uh, that bottle of wine. You in the mood for, uh,
something grape?"
261,Rachel, That'd be good.
262,Ross," Alright. (He goes to get the glasses. Then he hesitates and turns off the
main light. Rachel looks round and he acts surprised) The, uh, the neighbours must be
vacuuming. (He sits down and starts to pour the wine) Well, so long as we're here and, uh,
not on the subject, I was thinking about, uh, how mad we got at each other before, and,
um, I was thinking maybe it was partially because of how we, um..."
265,Rachel, Barry?!
268,Ross, We have got to start locking that door!
271,Monica, This is me in The Sound of Music. See the von Trapp kids?
272,Phoebe, Nope.
273,Monica, That's because I'm in front of them.
274,Chandler, Eh. I thought that was an alp.
275,Monica," Well, high school was not my favourite time."
276,Joey," I dunno, I loved high school. Y'know? It was just four years of parties
and dating and sex."
277,Chandler," Yeah, well I went to boarding school with four hundred boys. Any sex I
had would've involved a major lifestyle choice."
278,Monica," Gosh, doesn't it seem like a million years ago?"
279,Phoebe," Oh. Oooh! Ooh! Ooh! (She stands up and starts to dance around) Ooh! My
butt cheek is waking up! Oooh! Ooh!"
0,Chandler," I can't believe you would actually say that. I would much
rather be Mr.Peanut than Mr.Salty."
1,Joey," No way! Mr.Salty is a sailor, all right, he's got to be, like, thetoughest
snack there is."
2,Ross," I don't know, you don't wanna mess with corn nuts. They're craaazy."
3,Monica," (looking out of the window) Oh my God. You guys! You gotta come see
this! There's some creep out there with a telescope!"
4,Ross, I can't believe it! He's looking right at us!
5,Rachel," Oh, that is so sick."
6,Chandler, I feel violated. And not in a good way.
7,Phoebe," How can people do that?... (All but Phoebe walk away from the window in
disgust.) Oh, you guys, look! Ugly Naked Guy got gravity boots!"
10,Chandler," I am telling you, years from now, schoolchildren will study it as one
of the greatest first dates of all time. It was unbelievable! We could totally be
ourselves, we didn't have to play any games..."
11,Monica, So have you called her yet?
12,Chandler," Let her know I like her? What are you, insane? (The girls make
disgusted noises.) It's the next day! How needy do I want to seem? (To the guys) I'm
right, right?"
14,Monica," I can't believe my parents are actually pressuring me to find one of you
people."
15,Phoebe," Oh, God, just do it! (Grabbing the phone.) Call her! Stop being so
testosteroney!"
16,Chandler," Which, by the way, is the real San Francisco treat. (Calls her, then
hurriedly hangs up.) I got her machine."
17,Joey, Her answer machine?
18,Chandler," No, interestingly enough her leaf blower picked up."
19,Phoebe," So, uh, why didn't you say anything?"
20,Chandler," Oh, no-no-no-no. Last time I left a spontaneous message I ended up
using the phrase ""Yes indeedy-o."""
21,Monica," Look look! It's Rachel and Barry. No, don't everybody look at once!"
22,Ross," Okay, okay, what's going on?"
23,Phoebe," Okay, they're just talking..."
24,Ross," Yeah, well, does he look upset? Does he look like he was just told to
shove anything?"
25,Phoebe," No, no actually, he's smiling.. and... Oh my God, don't do that!!"
26,Ross, What? What? What?!
27,Phoebe, That man across the street just kicked that pigeon! (Rachel enters.) Oh!
28,Chandler," (bluffing) And basically, that's how a bill becomes a law."
30,Chandler, Hey Rach!
31,Monica, How'd it go?
32,Rachel," Y'know, it was, uh.. it was actually really great. He took me to lunch
at the Russian Tea Room, and I had that chicken, where y'know you poke it and all
the butter squirts out..."
33,Phoebe, Not a good day for birds...
34,Rachel," Then we took a walk down to Bendall's, and I told him not to,
but he got me a little bottle of Chanel..."
35,Ross," That's nice... now, was that before or after you told him to stop calling,
stop sending you flowers and to generally leave you alone, hmm?"
36,Rachel," Right,.. well,.. we never actually got to that... Oh, it was just so
nice to see him again, y'know? It was comfortable, it was familiar... it was just nice!"
37,Ross," That's, that's nice twice!"
38,Monica," Rachel, what's going on? I mean isn't this the same Barry who you left
at the altar?"
39,Joey," Duh, where've you been?"
40,Rachel," Yeah, but it was different with him today! And he wasn't, like,
Orthodontist Guy, y'know? I mean, we had fun! Is there anything wrong with that?"
42,Chandler, Yes!
43,Rachel, Why?
44,Chandler, I have my reasons.
45,Monica," Okay, how about the fact that he's engaged to another woman, who just
happens to be your ex-best friend?"
46,Rachel," All right. All right, all right, all right, all right, I know it's
stupid! I will go see him this afternoon, and I will just put an end to it!"
48,Rachel, Wow... Wow!
50,Rachel," I'm not crazy, right? I mean, it was never like that."
52,Rachel," Ooh, and it's so nice having this little sink here..."
54,Chandler," (on phone, reading from a script) Oh, Danielle! I wasn't expecting the
machine... Give me a call when you get a chance. (Rattles some dishes) Bye-bye. (Hangs
up.) Oh God!"
55,Monica," That's what you've been working on for the past two
hours?!"
56,Chandler," Hey, I've been honing!"
57,Ross, What was with the dishes?
58,Chandler," Oh, uh.. I want her to think I might be in a restaurant.. y'know? I
might have some kind of life, like I haven't been sitting around here honing for the past
few hours."
59,Monica," (looking out the window) Look look! He's doing it again, the guy with
the telescope!"
60,Phoebe," Oh my God! (Walks to the window) Go away! (Gesturing.) Stop looking in
here!"
61,Monica," Great, now he's waving back."
62,Joey," Man, we gotta do something about that guy. This morning, I caught him
looking into our apartment. It creeps me out! I feel like I can't do stuff!"
63,Monica, What kinda stuff?
64,Joey," Will you grow up? I'm not talking about sexy stuff, but, like, when I'm
cooking naked."
65,Phoebe, You cook naked?
66,Joey," Yeah, toast, oatmeal... nothing that spatters."
68,Chandler, What are you looking at me for? I didn't know that.
71,Rachel," Oh, it's just... Oh, Barry, this was not good."
73,Rachel," Well, what about Mindy?"
75,Rachel," No, not that, I mean, what about you and Mindy?"
77,Rachel," No. No-no-no-no, no. I mean, don't do that. Not, I mean not for me. "
80,Rachel," Oh, Barry..! Come on, this is all way too.."
83,Rachel, I had a bra.
89,Rachel, What?!
93,Chandler, Can I use your phone?
94,Monica," Yeah.. uh, but for future reference, that thing in your hand can also be
used as a phone."
96,Chandler," Yes, it's working! Why isn't she calling me back?"
97,Joey, Maybe she never got your message.
98,Phoebe," Y'know, if you want, you can call her machine, and if she has a lot of
beeps, that means she probably didn't get her messages yet."
99,Chandler, Y'don't think that makes me seem a little...
100,Ross," ...desperate, needy, pathetic?"
101,Chandler," Ah, you obviously saw my personal ad."
103,Phoebe, How many beeps?
104,Chandler, She answered.
105,Monica," Y'see, this is where you'd use that 'hello' word we talked about."
106,Chandler," I'm not gonna talk to her, she obviously got my message and is
choosing not to call me. Now I'm needy and snubbed. God, I miss just being needy."
109,Phoebe, How'd he take it?
110,Rachel," Pretty well, actually... (Wandering into the kitchen.)"
111,Monica," (wandering in after her) Uh, Rach... how come you have dental floss in
your hair?"
112,Rachel," Oh, do I?"
113,Monica, Uh huh.
114,Rachel, (in a low voice) We ended up having sex in his chair.
115,Monica," You had sex in his chair?!... I said
that a little too loudly, didn't I?"
116,Ross, You-you had what?
117,Phoebe, Sex in his chair.
118,Ross," What, uh... what were you thinking?"
119,Rachel," I don't know! I mean, we still care about each other. There's a history
there. 'S'like you and Carol."
120,Ross," No! No no, it is nothing like me and Carol!"
121,Rachel," Please. If she said to you, ""Ross, I want you on this couch, right
here, right now,"" what would you say? "
123,Chandler," If it helps, I could slide over."
124,Ross," It's, it's, it's, uh, a totally diferent situation! It's, it's apples and
oranges, it's, it's orthodontists and lesbi- I gotta go."
125,Phoebe, Where are you going?
126,Ross," (leaving) I just have to go, all right? Do I need a reason? Huh? I mean I
have things to do with my life, I have a jam packed schedule, and I am late- for keeping
up with it. Okay?"
128,Chandler, Hello? Hello?
130,Rachel," (on phone) Hello?(Listens) Mindy! Hi! Hey, how are you? (Listens) Yes,
yes, I've heard, congratulations, that is so great. (Listens) Really? (Listens) Oh.
(Listens) Okay. Okay, well I'm working tomorrow, but if you want you can, you can, you can
come by and... (Listens) Okay... (Listens) Great... (Listens) Great... (Listens) All
right, so I'll, so I'll see you tomorrow! (Listens) Okay.. (Listens) Okay... (Listens)
Bye. (Hangs up and sits down heavily.) Oh God. Oh God. Oh God."
131,Chandler, So how's Mindy?
132,Rachel," Oh, she wants to see me tomorrow...Oh, she sounded really weird, I gotta
call Barry... (Does so, on phone) Hi, it's me, I just.. Mindy!! Mindy! Hi! No, I figured
that's where you'd be!"
135,Monica, Brrrrrrr!
137,Chandler, Hell is filled with people like you.
138,Joey, (entering) He's back! The peeper's back!
140,Joey, (ducking) Get down!
141,Rachel, Get down?
142,Chandler, ...And boogie!
143,Rachel," Thanks, but I gotta go to work and get my eyes scratched out by Mindy."
144,Monica," Relax. Y'know, she may not even know."
145,Rachel," Please. I haven't heard from her in seven months, and now she calls me?
I mean, what else is it about? Oh! She was my best friend, you guys! We went to camp
together... she taught me how to kiss.."
146,Joey, (intrigued) Yeah?
147,Rachel," And now, y'know, I'm like... I'm like the other woman! I feel so.."
148,Joey, ..Naughty!
149,Rachel," Right, I'll see you guys later..."
150,Joey," Oh, hold up, I'll walk out with you. Now, Rach, when she taught you to
kiss, you were at camp, and.. were you wearing any kinda little uniform, or- (Rachel exits
and slams the door in his face.) That's fine, yeah..."
152,Chandler," Okay, I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Will you watch my phone?"
153,Monica, Why don't you just take it with you?
154,Chandler," Hey, we haven't been on a second date, she needs to hear me pee?"
155,Monica, Why don't you just call her?
156,Chandler," I can't call her, I left a message! I have some pride."
157,Monica, Do you?
158,Chandler," No! (Calls) Danielle, hi! It's, uh, it's Chandler! (Listens) I'm fine.
Uh, listen, I don't know if you tried to call me, because, uh, idiot that I am, I
accidentally shut off my phone. (Listens) Oh, uh, okay, that's fine, that's great.
(Listens) Okay. (Puts down the phone.) (to Monica) She's on the other line, she's gonna
call me back. (He starts doing a little jig.) She's on the other line, she's gonna call me
back, she's on the other line, gonna call me back..."
159,Monica, Don't you have to pee?
160,Chandler, 'S'why I'm dancing...
162,Rachel, Mindy.
164,Rachel," Hey, you.... So, what's up?"
166,Rachel, Sure we should... So.
168,Rachel, Okay.
170,Rachel, Of course!
172,Rachel, Was that all you wanted to ask me?
174,Rachel, Ohhhh!! (Mindy starts to sob.) ...What? What?
176,Rachel, Oh sure it is!
178,Rachel," Um, what- what would make you think that?"
180,Rachel," (draws back) Really. Mindy, if it'll make you feel any better, when I
was engaged to him he went through a whole weird thing too."
182,Rachel, What? What's what you were afraid of?
184,Rachel, What?
186,Rachel," Uh... Oh, Mindy, you are so stupid. Oh, we are both so stupid."
188,Rachel, (offers her arm to Mindy and she sniffs) Smell familiar?
190,Rachel," Oh, I am so sorry."
193,Joey, (watches them for a while) Oh my.
195,Ross," Four letters ""Circle or hoop""."
196,Chandler," Ring dammit, ring!"
197,Ross, Thanks.
198,Joey," (entering) Hey, you know our phone's not working?"
199,Chandler, What?!
200,Joey," I tried to call you from the coffee shop, and there was no answer."
201,Chandler," (investigating) I turned it off. Mother of God, I turned it off!"
202,Monica," Just like you told her you did! (Chandler glares at her.) ... Just
pointing out the irony."
203,Joey," Hey, so listen, I went across the street and talked to the doorman- I got
the peeper's name! Can I use the phone?"
204,Chandler, Nngghhh!!!!!!!
205,Joey," (to Monica) Can I use your phone? (On phone) Yeah, the number for a Sidney
Marks, please."
206,Ross," ""Heating device."""
207,Phoebe, Radiator.
208,Ross, Five letters.
209,Phoebe, Rdtor.
210,Joey," (on phone) Yeah, is Sidney there? (Listens) Oh, this is? (To the gang)
Sidney's a woman."
211,Monica, So she's a woman! So what?
212,Joey," Yeah. Yeah, so what? (On phone) Look, I live across the street, (walking
to the window) and I know all about you and your little telescope, and I don't appreciate
it, okay? (Listens) Yeah, I can see you right now! (Listens) Hello! (Listens) If I wanna
walk around my apartment in my underwear, I shouldn't have to feel
like—(Listens)—Thank you, but... that's not really the point... (Listens) The
point is that... (Listens) Mostly free weights, but occasionally.."
213,Monica, Joey!!
214,Joey," (on phone) Yeah, my neighbor... (Listens) Yeah, the brunette... (to
Monica) She says you looked very pretty the other day in the green dress."
215,Monica, The green dress? Really?
216,Joey," Yeah, she said you looked like Ingrid Bergman that day."
217,Monica, (waves dismissively to Sidney) Nooo!
219,Rachel, Hey. Got a second?
223,Rachel," Uh, we are here to break up with you."
227,Rachel," Uh- which one of us are you talking to there, Barr?"
229,Rachel, Even when we were having sex in that chair?
231,Rachel," Please! During that second time you couldn't have picked her out of a
lineup!"
233,Rachel," Well, the first time didn't really count... I mean, y'know, 's'Barry."
239,Rachel," Okay. Okay, we'll be here! Hating you! Did you see how he was sweating
when he walked out of there? Listen honey, if I'm hogging the ball too much you just jump
right in there and take a couple punches because I'm telling you, this feels great."
241,Rachel," What are you talking about?! Mindy, the guy is the devil! He's Satan in
a smock!"
243,Rachel, Oh God. 
245,Rachel, And I hope Barry doesn't kill you and eat you in Aruba.
247,Monica, You okay?
248,Rachel, Yeah.
249,Monica, Really?
250,Rachel," Yeah! Y'know, ever since I ran out on Barry at the wedding, I have
wondered whether I made the right choice. And now I know."
251,Monica, Aww... (They hug)
253,Joey, Big day.
256,Joey," All right, I'll give you this, Mr. Peanut is a better dresser. I mean he's
got the monocle, he's got the top hat..."
257,Phoebe, You know he's gay?
258,Ross, I just wanna clarify this are you outing Mr. Peanut?
260,Chandler," Danielle! Hi! Uh- everybody, this is Danielle, Danielle, everybody."
262,Chandler, What are you doing here?
264,Chandler," ...I'm, I'm okay."
266,Chandler," That sounds good. I'll call you- or you call me, whatever..."
268,Chandler, Okay.
271,Phoebe, Whoo-hoo!
272,Monica," Yeah, there you go!"
273,Ross, Second date!
274,Chandler, ...I dunno.
275,Rachel, You don't know?!
276,Chandler," Well, she seems very nice and everything, but that whole thing about
her coming all the way down here, just to see if I was okay? I mean,... how needy is that?"
0,Joey, How could someone get a hold of your credit card number?
1,Monica, I have no idea. But look how much they spent!
2,Rachel," Monica, would you calm down? The credit card people said that you only
have to pay for the stuff that you bought."
3,Monica, I know. It's just such reckless spending.
4,Ross," I think when someone steals your credit card, they've kind of already
thrown caution to the wind."
5,Chandler," Wow, what a geek. They spent $69.95 on a Wonder Mop."
6,Monica, That's me.
7,Phoebe," Oh! The yuk! Ross, he's doing it again! (Points to a lamp which is
shaking behind the sofa)"
8,Ross," Marcel, stop humping the lamp! Stop humping! Now Marcel, come back-
(Marcel runs toward Rachel's room) come here, Marcel-"
9,Rachel," Oh no, not in my room! I'll get him."
10,Monica," Ross, you've got to do something about the humping."
11,Ross," What? It's, it's just a phase."
12,Chandler," Well, that's what we said about Joey..."
13,Ross, Would you all relax? It's not that big a deal.
14,Rachel, (Out of shot) Stop it! Marcel! Bad monkey!
15,Ross, What?
16,Rachel, Let's just say my Curious George doll is no longer curious.
19,Rachel," Oh, Monica. You are not still going over that thing."
20,Monica, This woman's living my life.
21,Rachel, What?
22,Monica," She's living my life, and she's doing it better than me! Look at this,
look. She buys tickets for plays that I wanna see. She, she buys clothes from stores that
I'm intimidated by the sales people. She spent three hundred dollars on art supplies."
23,Rachel, You're not an artist.
24,Monica," Yeah, well I might be if I had the supplies! I mean, I could do all this
stuff. Only I don't."
25,Rachel," Oh, Monica, c'mon, you do cool things."
26,Monica," Oh really? Okay, let's compare, shall we."
27,Rachel," (Yawning) Oh, it's so late for 'Shall we'..."
28,Monica," Do I go horseback riding in the park? Do I take classes at the New
School?"
29,Rachel, (Yawning) Nooo...
30,Monica," This is so unfair! She's got everything I want, and she doesn't have my
mother."
32,Chandler, How about Joey... Pepponi?
33,Joey," No, still too ethnic. My agent thinks I should have a name that's more
neutral."
34,Chandler, Joey... Switzerland?
36,Joey," Plus, y'know, I think it should be Joe. Y'know, Joey makes me sound like
I'm, I dunno, this big. (Waitress looks at him funny) Which I'm not."
37,Chandler, Joe...Joe...Joe...Stalin?
38,Joey, Stalin...Stalin...do I know that name? It sounds familiar.
39,Chandler," Well, it does not ring a bell with me..."
40,Joey," (Writes it down) Joe Stalin. Y'know, that's pretty good."
41,Chandler, Might wanna try Joseph.
43,Joey, Joseph Stalin. I think you'd remember that!
44,Chandler," Oh yes! Bye Bye Birdie, starring Joseph Stalin. Joseph Stalin is the
Fiddler on the Roof."
46,Rachel, Hey.
47,Phoebe, Hey.
48,Monica," Hi. (On the phone) Hi, uh, yes, this is Monica Geller. Um, I believe I'm
taking some classes with you and I was wondering what they were."
49,Phoebe, What are you doing?
50,Monica," (Hushes her) Alright, great. Thanks a lot. (Hangs up) I'm going to tap
class."
51,Rachel," What, what, so that you can dance with the woman that stole your credit
card?"
52,Monica," This woman's got my life, I should get to see who she is."
53,Rachel," Go to the post office! I'm sure her picture's up! ...Okay, Monica,
y'know what, honey, you're kinda losing it here! I mean, this is really becoming like a
weird obsession thing."
54,Phoebe," This is madness. It's madness, I tell you, for the love of God,
Monica, don't do it!! ...Thank you."
56,Monica, What d'you think?
57,Phoebe, Lotsa things.
59,Rachel, Which one do you think she is?
62,Monica," Oh, no thanks, we're just here to observe."
64,Rachel, What does she mean?
65,Phoebe, I think she means (Imitates) 'You dance
66,Monica," Okay, d'y'see anybody you think could be me?"
68,Rachel, She could be you.
72,Monica," Okay, I'm not getting this!"
73,Phoebe," (Dancing in a swirly, Phoebe kind of way) I'm totally getting it!"
74,Monica," Did you ever feel like sometimes you are just so unbelievably
uncoordinated?"
76,Rachel, What? You just click when they click.
79,Phoebe," Okay. And, my, dead, mother, says, you, are, it. I'm with Rachel."
80,Monica, Great. It's gym class all over again.
83,Monica, Why don't I just take off my clothes and have a nightmare.
88,Monica, Oh. Monica! ...Hi. I'm Mo- ...nana.
90,Monica, Yeah. It's Dutch.
92,Monica," Um, Pennsylvania Dutch."
95,Ross, (Mortified) Hi.
97,Joey, Where've you been?
98,Ross, At the vet.
99,Chandler," She's not gonna make you wear one of those big plastic cones, is she?"
100,Ross," She says Marcel's humping thing's not a phase. Apparently he's reached
sexual maturity."
101,Joey, (To Chandler) Hey! He beat ya.
102,Ross," She says as time goes on, he's gonna start getting agressive and violent."
103,Chandler, So what does this mean?
104,Ross, I'm gonna have to give him up.
107,Joey," I can't believe it, Ross. This sucks!"
108,Chandler," I don't get it, I mean, you just got him. How can he be an adult
already?"
109,Ross," I know. I know. I mean, one day, he's this little thing, and before you
know it, he's this little thing I can't get off my leg."
110,Joey, Isn't there any way you can keep him?
111,Ross," No, no. The vet says unless he's in a place where he has regular access to
some... monkey lovin,' he's just gonna get vicious. I've just gotta get him into a zoo."
112,Joey, How do you get a monkey into a zoo?
113,Chandler," I know that one! ...No, that's Popes into a Volkswagen."
114,Ross," Well, we're applying to a lot of them. Naturally our first choice would be
one of the bigger state zoos, y'know, like, uh, San Diego... right? But that might just be
a pipe dream, because, y'know, he's out of state. Uh, my vet, uh, knows someone at Miami,
so that's a possibility."
115,Chandler," Yeah, but that's like two blocks away from the beach. I mean, it's a
total party zoo."
117,Phoebe," Hey. We found her, we found the girl."
118,Chandler, What?
119,Joey, Did you call the cops?
120,Rachel, Nope. We took her to lunch.
121,Chandler, Ah. Your own brand of vigilante justice.
122,Ross," What?! Are you insane? This woman stole from you. She stole. She's a
stealer."
123,Monica," Y'know what? After you're with this woman for like ten minutes, you
forget all that. I mean, she is this astounding person, with this, with this amazing
spirit."
124,Ross," Yeah, which she probably stole from some cheerleader."
125,Chandler, ...Take off their hats!
126,Phoebe, Popes in a Volkswagen! ...I love that joke.
128,Rachel, No way. No way did you do this.
130,Monica," It was so wild. We told them we were the Gunnersens in room six fifteen.
Only to find out the Boston Celtics had taken over the entire sixth floor!"
132,Monica, ...They threw us out! I was thrown out of a hotel! Me!
133,Rachel," Go Monana! Well, you ladies are not the only ones living the dream. I
get to go pour coffee for people I don't know. Don't wait up. (Exits)"
135,Monica, 'Scuse me?
137,Monica," Nononononono. Think who you're dealing with here. I mean, I'm not like
you. I-I can't even stand in front of a tap class."
139,Monica, What?
141,Monica," Right. Till I bought a blow dryer, then I was shunned."
143,Monica, Uh-huh.
145,Monica, Wow. Then I would definitely not recommend Mrs. Doubtfire.
147,Ross," (Reading letters) Oh God. (To Marcel) We didn't get into Scranton. (To the
others) That was like our safety zoo. They take like dogs and cows. See? I don't know who
this is harder on, me or him."
148,Phoebe, I'd say that chair's taking the brunt.
149,Ross," Marcel! Marcel! Marcel, no! Good boy. See, how can nobody want him?"
150,Rachel," Oh, somebody will."
151,Joey, (entering) You know there already is a Joseph Stalin?
152,Chandler, You're kidding.
153,Joey," Apparently he was this Russian dictator who slaughtered all these people.
You'd think you would've known that!"
154,Chandler," Y'know, you'd think I would've."
155,Joey, Phoebe. Whaddyou think a good stage name for me would be?
156,Phoebe, ...Flame Boy.
158,Ross, Where exactly is your zoo?
160,Ross, Yes.
162,Ross," No-no, he's, he's very docile."
164,Ross," Well I, I don't know. Why?"
166,Ross," He can hold a banana, if that's whatcha mean..."
168,Ross, Why- why- why would he need a blade?
172,Joey," We, we come back from our walk and the- the phone was ringing..."
173,Chandler, ...He's in.
174,Ross," He's in! Oh, did you hear that, Marcel? San Diego. San Diego!"
177,Monica, Yo- hooo!
178,Rachel, Where the hell've you been?
179,Monica, Monica and I just crashed an embassy party.
180,Rachel, Are you drunk?!
181,Monica, Noooo! (Comes closer and whispers) I'm lying. I am so drunk.
182,Rachel," Oh God, oh. Great, Monica, y'know what, you could've called, I have been
up here, I've been worried..."
184,Rachel, Monica? Monica!
185,Monica, Water rules!
186,Rachel," Yes, yes, it does. Okay, look, the restaurant called, they wanna know if
you're gonna be showing up for work?"
187,Monica, Nope. Going to the Big Apple Circus today.
188,Rachel," Okay Monica, what are you doing? You're gonna lose your job! This is not
you!"
189,Monica," No, it is me! Y'know, I'm not just the person who needs to fluff the
pillows and pay the bills as soon as they come in! Y'know, when I'm with her, I am so much
more than that. I'm- I'm Monana!"
191,Rachel," Hello? Yes, she is, hold on a second, please. Monana, it's for you, the
credit card people."
192,Monica, Helloooo? Yeah. Oh my God. Thanks.
193,Rachel, What?
194,Monica, They've arrested Monica.
196,Monica, Hi.
198,Monica, How are you?
200,Monica, Because... I'm Monica Geller. It was my credit card you were using.
202,Monica," I want you to know, it wasn't me who turned you in."
204,Monica," No, thank you! You have given me so much! I mean, if it wasn't for you,
I would never have gotten to sing Memories on the stage at the Wintergarden
Theater!"
206,Monica," I just can't believe you're in here. I mean, what am I gonna do without
you? Who's gonna crash the embassy parties with me? Who's gonna take me to the Big
Apple Circus?"
208,Monica," Well, not... worried, just... wondering."
210,Monica, Not necessarily...
212,Monica," Um, I'm not actually Amish."
216,Monica, In. (She joins in the dancing. She still flounders)
218,Monica," Yeah, but at least I'm doing it!"
221,Phoebe," Okay. Good-bye, little monkey guy. Alright, I wrote you this poem. Okay,
but don't eat it 'till you get on the plane."
222,Ross," Aww. Thank you, Aunt Phoebe."
223,Phoebe, Oh!
224,Chandler," Okay, bye, champ. Now, I know there's gonna be a lot of babes in San
Diego, but remember, there's also a lot to learn."
225,Joey," I dunno what to say, Ross. Uh, it's a monkey."
226,Ross," Just, just say what you feel."
227,Joey," Marcel, I'm hungry."
228,Ross, That was good.
229,Rachel," (Brings Marcel a teddy bear) Marcel, this is for you. It's, uh, just,
y'know, something to, um, do on the plane."
230,Ross," Uh, if you guys don't mind, I'd like to take a moment, just me and him."
232,Ross," Marcel, c'mere, c'mere. (He sits down and Marcel jumps down and sits
beside him) Well buddy, this is it. There's just a coupla things I want to say. I'm really
gonna miss you, and I'm never gonna forget about you. You've been more than just a pet to
me, you've been more like a be- (Marcel climbs down and starts humping his leg) Okay,
Marcel, please, could you leave my leg alone? Could you just stop humping me for two
seconds?! Marcel, would- okay, just take him away. Just take him."
239,Joey," Hi, uh, I'll be reading for the role of Mercutio."
241,Joey, Holden McGroin.
0,Monica, Tell him.
1,Rachel, No.
2,Phoebe," Tell him, tell him."
3,Monica, Just...please tell him.
4,Rachel, Shut up!
5,Chandler, Tell me what?
6,Monica," Look at you, you won't even look at him."
7,Chandler," (sarcastically) Oh, come on tell me. I could use another reason why
women won't look at me."
8,Rachel," All right, all right, all right. Last night, I had a dream that, uh, you
and I, were..."
9,Phoebe, Doing it on this table. (points at the table)
10,Chandler, Wow!
11,Joey, Exellent dream score.
12,Ross," Why, why, why would you dream that?"
13,Chandler," More importantly, was I any good?"
14,Rachel," Well, you were pretty damn good."
15,Chandler," Interesting, cause in my dreams, I'm allways surprisingly inadequate.
(Monica pats him on his lap)"
16,Rachel," Well, last night you seemed to know your way around the table."
17,Ross," I love it, when we share."
19,Chandler, You're okay there?
20,Ross, I can't belive you two had sex in her dream.
21,Chandler," I'm sorry, it was a one-time-thing. I was very drunk and i was
somebody else's subconscious."
24,Chandler, Hello Rachel.
25,Rachel, Get off.
26,Phoebe," (points at Joey's pen) Uh, uh, gimme. Can you see me operating a drill
press?"
27,Joey, I don't know. What are you wearing?
29,Ross," Pheebs, why would you want to operate a drill press?"
30,Phoebe," Just for some short-term-work. You know, until I get back some of my
massage clients."
31,Chandler, Pirates again?
32,Phoebe," No, nothing like that. I was just...such a dummie. I taught this
""massage-yourself-at-home-workshop."" And they are."
33,Joey," Hey, hey, Chan. She could work for you."
34,Chandler," (sarcasticly) Thanks Joey, that's a good idea."
35,Phoebe," What... I could, I could do it. What is it?"
36,Chandler," Well, my secretary is gonna be out for a couple of weeks. She is
having one of her boobs redused. (Ross looks at her.) It's a whole big boob story."
37,Phoebe, I could be a secretary.
38,Chandler," Well, you know Phoebs. I don't know if it's your kinda thing, because
it involves a lot of being normal. For a large portion of the day."
39,Phoebe, I could do that.
41,Rachel, What are you playing with?
42,Ross," Oh, it's my new beeper."
43,Joey, What the hell does a paleontologist need a beeper for?
44,Monica," Is it like for dinosaur emergencies. 'Help, come quick, they're still
extinct.'"
45,Ross," No, it's for when Carol goes into labor. She can get me wherever I am. I
mean, all she has to do is to dial 55-JIMBO."
46,Chandler," A cool phone number, and a possible name for the kid."
47,Monica," All right, I'll see you guys later. (raises)"
48,Rachel, Off to see young Ethan?
49,Monica, Thank you.
50,Joey, How young is young Ethan? Young?
51,Monica, He's... our age.
52,Chandler, When we were?
53,Monica," Okay, he's a senior in college."
54,Ross, College?
55,Chandler, Whoa! And this manchild has no problem with how old you are?
56,Monica," No, of course not. It's not even an issue. Cause I told him I was 22."
58,Monica," Oh, I can't pass for 22?"
59,Phoebe," Well, maybe 25-26."
60,Monica, I am 26.
61,Phoebe, There you go.
63,Chandler, Can you hear that?
64,Phoebe, (plays with a thumbtack remover) Yeah?
65,Chandler, See that'll stop when you pick up the phone.
66,Phoebe," Oh. Uh, I'm on. (picks up the phone)"
67,Phoebe," (with a deep voice) Mr. Bing's office. (Listens) No I'm sorry, he's in a
meeting right now."
68,Chandler, I'm not in a meeting. I'm right... Whoops.
69,Phoebe," Will he know what this is in reference to? (Listens) And he has your
number? (Listens) All right, I'll see that he gets the message. Bye bye."
70,Chandler, What?
71,Phoebe, Ross says hi.
72,Chandler, Ah!
73,Phoebe," This is so fun. All right, what do we do now?"
74,Chandler," Well, now, I actually have to get to work."
75,Phoebe," Most likely. (raises and goes toward the door) Okay, I'm gonna be out
there."
76,Chandler, Okay.
77,Phoebe, All right. Bye bye.
78,Chandler, Bye bye.
80,Chandler, (answering it) Yes?
81,Phoebe, Whatcha doin'?
82,Chandler, Ooh. (leans against the desk)
84,Monica," Windows are clean, candels are lit. Uh, belt's to tight, gotta change
the belt. Did I turn the fish? (goes over to the kitchen to check on the dinner) No, cause
I made lasagne. (to Rachel) Am I out of control?"
85,Rachel," Just a touch. Mon, I don't understand. I mean, you've been dating this
guy since like, what... his midterms? I mean, why all the sudden are you so... Oh."
86,Monica, What?
87,Rachel, Could tonight be the Night?
88,Monica," I don't know. Look he's a great guy and I love being with him but... you
know. Things happen, and they happen. You don't plan these things."
89,Rachel," So, did you shave your legs?"
90,Monica, Yeah.
91,Rachel, A-ha!
93,Joey, Would you let it go Ross. It was just a dream. It doesn't mean...
95,Ross," Oh, oh. Oh, oh. Oh this is it. Oh my god it's baby time. Baby time."
96,Joey," All right, relax, relax. Just relax, just relax. Be cool, be cool."
98,Ross," (on phone) Yeah, hi, I was just beeped. (pause) No, André is not here.
(to Joey) Third time today. (on phone) Yes, I'm sure... No, sir. I don't perform those
kind of services."
99,Joey," Services? (Ross looks at him) Oh, services."
100,Ross," (on phone) Yeah, you want 55-JUMBO. Yeah, that's right. That's right,
JUMBO with a U, sir. (pause) No, belive me, you don't want me. Judging by his number, I'd
be a huge disappointment. (pause) All rightie, bye bye."
102,Joey," Hey, hey. How was the first day?"
103,Phoebe," Oh, exellent. Everyone was so, so nice."
104,Chandler," See, it pays to know the man who wears my shoes. (Joey and Ross wonder
what he means) Me."
105,Phoebe," No, I didn't tell anybody that I knew you."
106,Chandler, Why not?
107,Phoebe," Oh, because, you know... they don't like you."
108,Chandler, What?!
109,Phoebe, I thought you knew that.
110,Chandler, Noho. Who doesn't they like me?
111,Phoebe, Everyone. Except for uh... no everyone.
112,Chandler, What are you talking about?
113,Phoebe," Don't feel bad. You know they used to like you a lot. But then you got
promoted, and, you know, now you're like ""Mr. Boss Man"". You know, Mr. Bing. Mr.
Bing, ""Boss Man Bing""."
115,Chandler, I can't belive it.
116,Phoebe," Yeah, yeah. They even do you."
117,Chandler, They do me?
118,Phoebe," You know like... uh okay... uh... 'Could that report be any
later?'"
120,Chandler, I don't sound like that.
121,Ross," Oh, oh Chandler..."
122,Joey," Oh... Yeah, you do."
123,Ross, 'The hills were alive with the sound of music.'
125,Joey, (reaches for hi scones) My scones.
128,Chandler," Okay, I don't sound like that. That is so not true."
130,Chandler," That is so not... That is so not...
That... Oh, shut up!"
133,Monica, Did not.
135,Monica, How was that possible?
137,Monica, Okay.
140,Monica, Unless...
142,Monica," Uh, ah. Unless you wanna stay over? I mean, I'm going to, so..."
146,Monica," Okay, is this like 'I have an early class tomorrow' or 'I'm secretly
married to a goat?'"
148,Monica, Ethan?
150,Monica, Are you a virgin?
152,Monica, Really?
157,Monica, You keep saying that.
160,Monica," Listen, uh, you told me something that was really difficult for you. And
I, I-I figured if you could be honest, then I can to."
162,Monica, No-no. Nothing wrong about that. 
164,Monica," Um, okay, here it goes. I'm not 22. I'm, I'm 25... and thirteen months. "
166,Monica," But I figured, you know, that shouldn't change anything. I mean, what
the hell does it matter how old we are."
169,Monica, You're not a senior?
171,Monica, Ok...ay.
174,Monica," What we did was wrong. Oh god, I just had sex with somebody that wasn't
alive during the Bicentennial."
176,Monica," Ethan, focus. How could you not tell me?"
178,Monica," Well, that's different. My lie didn't make one of us a felon in 48
states. What were you thinking?"
180,Monica, Don't say it. (closes Ethan's mouth with her hand)
182,Monica, Really?
184,Monica," Well,fall out of it. You know, you shouldn't even be here, it's a school
night. Oh god, oh god. I'm like those women that you see with shiny guys named Chad. I'm
Joan Collins."
187,Ross," (on phone) Okay, André should be there in like 45 minutes. All rightie,
bye bye. (to Phoebe) Just easier that way."
188,Chandler," Oh, come on. You told me about the last dream."
189,Rachel," No, forget it."
190,Chandler," Oh, why not. Was I doing anything particularly... saucy?"
191,Rachel," All right, fine. Um, you were not the only one there. (Camera fades to
Ross, who's listening very carefully) Joey was there too."
192,Joey, All right. (Moves closer.)
193,Ross," Was there...uh, huh, huh, huh... andybody, anybody else there."
194,Rachel, No.
195,Ross," You're sure? Nobody uh, handed out uh, mints or anything?"
196,Rachel," No, it was just the three of us."
197,Ross, Huh!
198,Joey," So, tell me. Was it like you and Chandler, and then you and me, or you and
me and Chandler?"
199,Rachel, (laughs) You know what?
200,Joey, What?
201,Rachel, There were times when it wasn't even me.
203,Phoebe," That is so sweet, you guys. (hugs them)"
206,Rachel," Mon, Ethan called again. Mon?"
209,Monica, What?
210,Rachel, Ethan called again.
211,Monica, Oh.
212,Ross, Are you not seeing him anymore?
213,Monica," No. You know, sometimes just things doesn't work out."
214,Chandler," And this has nothing to do with the fact that he needs a note to get
out of gym."
216,Rachel," I, I didn't say any... I sw... I did not say anything, I swear. He
stopped by."
217,Joey," Listen, the next time you talk to him, can you ask him which one the
strongest Power Ranger is?"
219,Ross," Oh, yeah."
220,Monica," Ha,ha, ha, oh my life is just so amusing. Could we drop it now?"
222,Ross, It's morphin time!
223,Joey, Stegosaurus!
224,Chandler, Tyrannosaurus!
226,Phoebe," Ooh, oh, I've gotta go. (raises) Whoa, oh, head rush. One more, and then
I have to go. (sits down, and then raises again) Cool!"
227,Rachel, Where are you going?
228,Phoebe," Um, oh, I've got a birthday party, with some work people."
229,Chandler, Work people? Nobody told me.
230,Phoebe," No, I know. That's a part of the whole, you know,
them-not-liking-you-extravaganza."
231,Chandler," You know, I don't get this. A month ago, these people were my friends.
You know, just because I'm in charge doesn't mean I'm a different person."
232,Phoebe," Well, then you should come tonight. You know, just hang out with them.
Let them see what a great guy you still are."
233,Chandler, You think I should?
234,Phoebe," I really do, yeah."
235,Chandler, Okay.
236,Phoebe, Okay.
237,Chandler, Okay.
238,Phoebe," Oh, but, could we not go together? I,I don't wanna be the geek that
invited the boss."
240,Chandler," I Think last night was great. You know, the Karaoke thing. Tracy and I
doing Ebony and Ivory."
241,Phoebe, You were great. But they still made fun of you.
242,Chandler, What?
243,Phoebe," You know, now you're more like, you know like, ""Mr. Caring
Boss,"" ""Mr."", you know, ""I'm one of you, Boss,"" ""Mr., I
wanna be your buddy, Boss Man Bing!"""
244,Chandler," Then, I don't get it."
245,Phoebe," Well, you know what Chandler? I think you've gotta face it. You're like,
the guy in the big office, you know. You're the one that hires them, that fires them...
They still say you're a great boss."
246,Chandler, They do?
247,Phoebe, Uh huh. But they're not your friends anymore.
248,Chandler, I just wan't to...
249,Phoebe," No, but you can't."
250,Chandler, But I just wa...
251,Phoebe, Uh uh.
253,Monica, Aren't you gonna...
254,Ross," Oh, Carol and I have a new system. If she punches in 911, it means she's
having a baby, otherwise I just ignore it."
255,Joey, What about André?
256,Ross," Oh, well this morning he got a call from who I think was our cousin
Nathan, and frankly, it was a little more than I needed to know."
259,Monica, That was gonna be my opener.
260,Rachel," (understands that Monica and Ethan wanna be alone) Hey, did you guys
check out those new hand-dryers in the bathroom?"
261,Ross, I thought that was just a rumour.
262,Rachel, True story.
263,Joey, They're here already?
266,Monica, It was.
268,Monica," Ethan, it's um... it's icky."
270,Monica," This isn't easy for me either. I wish things were different, I... If you
were a few years older, or if I was a few years younger, or if we lived in biblical times,
I would really..."
272,Monica, ...love you.
274,Ross, Are you're hands still wet?
275,Joey," Uh, moist, yeah."
276,Rachel, Let's dry 'em again.
282,Chandler," Thanks. Listen, about the weekly numbers, I'm gonna need them on my
desk by nine o'clock."
286,Chandler," You have to give 'em something, you know. Okay, now that was Gerston,
Santos, and who's the guy with the moustache?"
287,Phoebe, Petrie.
288,Chandler," Petrie, right, right. Okay, some people gonna be working this weekend."
290,Rachel," (talking in her sleep) Oooooooooh. (Rachel strokes her hand over the
pillow. Ross mimicks her silently) Oh, that's nice. Oh, oh. Huh, Ross!"
292,Rachel, Ross?
293,Ross, I'm here.
294,Rachel," You are. Well, um... We, we, we were just...  Wow!"
295,Ross," What? (his beeper goes off) Great, now I'm having a baby."
296,Rachel, What?
297,Ross," Ooh, Ooh."
298,Rachel, What?
299,Ross," I'm having... I'm having a baby. (jumps back onto the table again) I'm
having a... Where's the phone? The phone?"
300,Rachel, I don't know where the phone is.
302,Rachel, Ross?
303,Ross, I'm hurt.
306,Ross," Monica, let's go. Come on now people, woman in labor."
308,Chandler," (doing a little dance) Hey Ross, look what I've got going here. "
309,Ross," Yeah, save it for the cab, okay."
311,Ross, What are you doing? We're going to a hospital.
312,Rachel," What, so I can't lokk nice? There might be doctors there."
313,Ross," Joey, get out of the fridge."
314,Joey," All right, all right. (he comes out from their apartment with a huge
sandwich in his hand)"
315,Ross, What is that? (refering to the sandwich)
316,Joey, For the ride.
317,Chandler," Yeah, like in a cab..."
318,Ross, Save it.
319,Chandler," Okay, hating this."
320,Ross," Monica, come on now. Let's go, baby coming."
322,Monica," I can't belive it, I'm gonna be an aunt. I'm gonna have like a nephew."
323,Ross," That's nice. Get out Let's go, come on."
324,Joey," All right, I'm going. I'm going."
326,Chandler," Here we go, here we go."
327,Rachel," Rossy, Rossy."
0,Ross," She's not here yet. She's not here. She's having my baby and she's not
here."
1,Monica, I'm sure everything's fine. Has her water broke yet?
2,Ross," I don't know, but when I spoke to her, she said she had already passed the
mucus plug."
4,Joey, Do we have to know about that?
5,Monica," Joey, what are you gonna do when you have a baby?"
6,Joey," I'm gonna be in the waitin' room, handing out cigars."
7,Chandler," Yes, Joey's made arrangements to have his baby in a movie from the
50's."
8,Ross," God, I don't believe this. She could be giving birth in the cab."
9,Rachel," Oh, Ross, relax. It's probably like two dollars for the first
contraction, and then fifty cents for each additional contraction."
11,Rachel," What, it's ok when Chandler does it?"
12,Chandler, You have to pick your moments.
14,Phoebe," Did I miss it, did I miss it?"
15,Ross, She's not even here yet.
16,Monica, What's with the guitar?
17,Phoebe," I just thought we might be here for awhile. You know, things might get
musical."
19,Ross, (to Carol) Where the hell have you been?
22,Ross," Susan wanted a Chunky. We're having a baby, ok, a baby, you don't
stop for Chunkys."
23,Chandler, I used to have that bumper sticker.
25,Chandler, (to Rachel) You see what I mean.
28,Ross, Stopped for a Chunky.
31,Ross, (weakly) No.
34,Ross," Dr. Franzblau, hi."
38,Ross," 59 seconds. (holds up his watch) Quartz, ha."
42,Ross, I'll get it.
44,Ross, I got it—I'm getting it!
46,Rachel," Hi, I thought you might like some ice chips."
48,Rachel," And if you need anything else, I—(notices the handsome Dr.
Franzblau)—do not believe we've met. Hi. I'm, uh, Rachel Green. I'm Carol's...
ex-husband's... sister's roommate. "
50,Rachel," Oh, that's funny!"
52,Monica, I want a baby.
53,Chandler," Mmmm. Not tonight, honey. I got an early day tomorrow."
54,Monica, Get up. Come on. Let's get some coffee.
55,Chandler," Oh, ok, 'cause we never do that."
57,Joey," (to the screen) Shoot! Shoot! Shoot! Shoot, or just fall down. That's good
too."
60,Joey," Oh, yeah."
62,Joey," Hey, listen, lady....(sees that she's pregnant)...whoa."
64,Joey, Oh yeah? And who do you like?
66,Joey," The Celtics? Ha. They couldn't hit a boat if...wait. They suck, alright?"
68,Joey," Wha? Wha..aa? Let me get the father. Hey, we need a father over here! We
need a father!"
70,Joey," Oh, oh, oh, sorry."
72,Joey," Oh, uh, ok. Right this way. All the other pregnant women seem to be goin'
in here."
76,Phoebe, (singing) 
79,Phoebe," Thanks, Ross."
80,Ross, Yeah. I'm paying you to stop.
81,Phoebe, Ok.
83,Phoebe," Oh, look, twins. Hi, guys. Oh, cute, cute."
84,Monica, No fair. I don't even have one. How come they get two?
85,Chandler, You'll get one.
86,Monica, Oh yeah? When?
87,Chandler," All right. I'll tell you what. When we're 40, if neither one of us are
married, what do you say you and I get together and have one?"
88,Monica, Why won't I be married when I'm 40?
89,Chandler," Oh, no, no. I just meant hypothetically."
90,Monica," Ok, hypothetically, why won't I be married when I'm 40?"
91,Chandler," No, no, no."
92,Monica, What is it? Is there something fundamentally unmarriable about me?
93,Chandler," (trapped) Uh, uh."
94,Monica, Well?
95,Chandler," Dear God! This parachute is a knapsack! (throws himself over the back
of the chair he was sitting in)"
97,Rachel, Hey.
98,Phoebe," Hey. Ooh, look at you, dressy-dress."
99,Monica, Did you go home and change?
100,Rachel," Yeah, well, it's an important day. I wanna look nice. Um, has uh Dr.
Franzblau been by?"
101,Monica," No, I haven't seen him."
102,Rachel," Well, where is he? He is supposed to be here. (Pause) What if the baby
needs him?"
103,Chandler," Rachel, what is the deal with you and doctors, anyway? Was, like, your
father a doctor? "
104,Rachel," Yeah, why?"
105,Chandler," No reason. (turns around, makes an 'Oh my God' gesture with his eyes)"
108,Joey, Tribbiani.
110,Joey," (takes phone) Hi, yeah, it's me. (Listens) Oh, no no no, we're just
friends. (Listens) Yeah, I'm single. (Listens) 25. (Listens) An actor. (Listens) Hello?"
112,Joey," Yeah, so, uh, so, uh, what's the deal with this father guy, I mean, if
someone was havin' my baby somewhere, I'd wanna know about it, you know?"
114,Joey," Ok, look, maybe I should just go."
116,Joey," Good luck, and uh, take care, huh? "
118,Joey, You know what the Celtics problem is? They let the players run the team.
120,Joey," Oh, it is."
122,Joey, It is.
125,Ross, Breathe.
127,Ross, Breathe.
129,Ross, Breathe.
132,Ross," 15 more seconds, 14, 13, 12..."
135,Ross, Who the hell is Jordie?
137,Ross," No-no-no. I don't have a son named Jordie. We all agreed, my son's name is
Jamie."
139,Ross," What? Whoa, whoa whoa whoa, what do you mean, back to Jordie? We
never landed on Jordie. We just passed by it during the whole Jessy, Cody, Dylan
fiasco."
141,Ross, I got it.
143,Ross," I got it! Hey, you get to sleep with her, I get the cramps."
146,Ross, Why?
148,Ross," No, you started it."
151,Ross, But...
153,Ross, (to Susan) Thanks a lot.
155,Ross," (to Carol) Yeah, listen..."
162,Joey, Ew! What is that? Something exploded!
164,Joey," (panicked) Water breaking, what do you mean? What's that, water breaking?"
167,Ross, Please. This is so your fault.
169,Ross," Look, Carol never threw me out of a room before you came along."
171,Ross, You tryin' to be clever? A funny lady?
173,Ross," Oh, I'm threatened by you?"
176,Phoebe," Hey, hey, ok, all right, that's it! Get in here. Come on. My god, you
guys, I don't believe you. There are children coming into the world in this very building
and your negative fighting noises are not the first thing they should be hearing. So just
stop all the yelling, just stop it!"
177,Ross," Yeah, Susan."
178,Phoebe," Don't make me do this again, I don't like my voice like this."
180,Phoebe," Ok, who wants to hear something ironic?"
184,Ross," I'm having a baby in here! Ok, everyone stand back. (Walks backwards as if
he is going to break down the door, but steps in a bucket and falls) Ow."
187,Rachel," No, honey, they're not, but don't worry, because we are going to find
them, and until we do, we are all here for you, ok?"
189,Rachel, Ok?
191,Rachel," (to Dr. Franzblau) Ok, so anyway, you were telling me about Paris, it
sounds fascinating."
194,Joey," Come on, Lydia, you can do it. Push! Push 'em out, push 'em out, harder,
harder. Push 'em out, push 'em out, way out! Let's get that ball and really move, hey,
hey, ho, ho. Let's— (notices the nurse looking at him strangely) I was
just—yeah, right. Push! Push! "
197,Ross, Help! Help!
198,Phoebe," (singing) They found their bodies the very next day, they found their
bodies the very next...(sees Ross and Susan staring at her) la la la la la la."
201,Monica," Now, Mom, everything's going fine, really. (Listens) Yeah, Ross is
great. He's uh, he's in a whole other place. (Listens) No, he's gone. (Listens) No no, you
don't have to fly back, really. (Listens) What do you mean this might be your only chance?
(Listens) Would you stop? I'm only 26, I'm not even thinking about babies yet. "
203,Chandler, Where have you been?
204,Joey," Oh, just had a baby."
205,Chandler, Mazel tov!
208,Rachel," (anxiously) No, no, not at the moment, no, I'm not. Are you?"
210,Rachel," Right, yeah, I've heard that about cute doctors."
212,Rachel, Oh.
214,Rachel, I'm a waitress.
216,Rachel, (getting the point) Yeah. Gotcha.
218,Rachel, Ok. That's fine. (takes her earrings out)
229,Ross," Come on, come on. Damnit, damnit, damnit, damnit. (to Susan) This is all
your fault. This is supposed to be, like, the greatest day of my life, y'know? My son is
being born, and I should be in there, you know, instead of stuck in a closet with you."
231,Ross," No no no, believe me. No one has been waiting for this as much as I have,
ok? And you know what the funny thing is? When this day is over, you get to go home with
the baby, ok? Where does that leave me?"
233,Ross, Every day is Lesbian Lover Day.
234,Phoebe, This is so great.
235,Ross, You wanna explain that?
236,Phoebe," I mean, well, 'cause when I was growing up, you know my dad left, and my
mother died, and my stepfather went to jail, so I barely had enough pieces of parents to
make one whole one. And here's this little baby who has like three whole parents who care
about it so much that they're fighting over who gets to love it the most. And it's not
even born yet. It's just, it's just the luckiest baby in the whole world. (pause) I'm
sorry, you were fighting."
239,Monica, I'm sure they'll be here soon.
240,Rachel," Yeah, honey, they wouldn't miss this."
241,Joey, Relax. You're only at nine centimeters. And the baby's at zero station.
242,Chandler, (to Joey) You are really frightening me.
244,Chandler," Somebody wanna help me, tryin' to rip out my heart. (they pull her
hand off of him) Uh, that's great. (looking around) Anybody seen a nipple?"
251,Ross," Ok, got the vent open."
252,Phoebe," (reading the nametag on the uniform) Hi, I'm Ben. I'm hospital worker
Ben. It's Ben... to the rescue!"
253,Ross," Ben, you ready? All right, gimme your foot. Ok, on three, Ben. One, two,
three. Ok, That's it, Ben."
256,Phoebe," Well, Susan, I see what appears to be a dark vent. Wait. Yes, it is in
fact a dark vent."
258,Ross," Phoebs, It's open! It's open!"
263,Ross, We're here!
265,Ross," Long story, honey."
270,Chandler," (to nurse) Let me ask you, do you have to be Carol's lesbian life
partner?"
273,Ross," Let me see, I gotta see, I gotta see. Oh, a head. Oh, it's, it's huge.
Carol, how are you doing this?"
276,Ross," (puts his head near the baby) Hello! (to Dr. Franzblau) Oh, sorry."
278,Ross," We got a head, we got shoulders, we got arms, we got, oh, look at the
little fingers, oh, and a chest, and a stomach. It's a boy, definitely a boy! All right!
Ok, legs, knees, and feet. Oh, oh. He's here. He's a person."
281,Ross," Kinda like my uncle Ed, covered in Jell-o."
283,Phoebe," (from the air vent overhead) You guys, he's beautiful!"
284,Ross," Oh, thanks, Pheebs!"
288,Ross, (thinking) How 'bout Ben?
291,Ross," We uh, we just cooked it up."
294,Monica, Hi.
295,Ross, Hey.
296,Monica, Can we come in?
298,Ross," (to Ben) I know, I know. Everybody, there's someone I'd like you to meet.
Yeah. This is Ben. Ben, this is everybody."
299,Phoebe," Susan, he looks just like you."
301,Rachel," Oh, god, I can't believe one of us actually has one of these."
302,Chandler," I know, I still am one of these."
303,Monica," Ross, can I?"
305,Ross," The head, the head. You gotta..."
306,Monica," (getting choked up) Hi, Ben. Hi. I'm your Aunt Monica. Yes I am. I'm
your Aunt Monica. I...I will always have gum."
309,Ross," Ben, I want you to know that there may be some times when I may not be
around, like this. (walks out of the picture) But I'll still always come back, like this.
(returns) And sometimes I may be away longer, like this. (walks away) But I'll still
always come back, like this. (returns) "
311,Chandler," And sometimes, I'll want you to steal third, and I'll go like this.
(Does a baseball sign.)"
313,Monica, He is so amazing.
314,Rachel," Oh, I know. Look at him."
315,Joey," Ben, Ben, hey Ben. Nothing. I don't think that's his name."
316,Phoebe," Oh, look, look, he's closing his eyes. (screen goes blank) Look, he's
opening his eyes. (picture comes back) "
317,Joey," He doesn't do much, does he?"
318,Ross," No, this is pretty much it."
320,Rachel, You guys wanna get some coffee?
322,Ross," All right, I'll see you guys later."
324,Phoebe," Oh, look, he's closing his eyes again."
0,Ross, And here's little Ben nodding off...
1,Monica," Awww, look at Aunt Monica's little boy!"
2,Phoebe," Oh, look, he's got Ross's haircut!"
3,Rachel," Oh, let me see! (grabs picture) Oh, God, is he just the sweetest thing?
You must just want to kiss him all over!"
5,Ross, (quietly) That would be nice.
7,Rachel, Pardon?
8,Chandler," Nothing, just a little extra air in my mouth. Pffft. Pffffffft. (walks
over to where Joey is seated)"
10,Joey," Hey, Chan, can you help me out here? I promise I'll pay you back."
11,Chandler," Oh, yeah, right, OK... inlcuding the waffles last week, you now owe
me... 17 jillion dollars."
12,Joey," I will, really. I'll pay you back this time."
13,Chandler, (sigh)... And where's this money coming from? (gives money to Joey)
14,Joey," Well... I'm helping out down at the N.Y.U. Med School with some...
research."
15,Ross, (overhearing) What kind of research?
16,Joey," Oh, just, y'know.... science."
17,Ross," Science. Yeah, I think I've heard of that. (everyone's interest is piqued,
they all look over)"
18,Joey, (sigh)... It's a fertility study.
20,Monica," Oh, Joey, please tell me you're only donating your time."
21,Joey," Alright, come on you guys, it's not that big a deal. Really... I mean, I
just go down there every other day and... make my contribution to the project. Hey, hey,
but at the end of two weeks, I get seven hundred dollars."
22,Ross, Hey.
23,Phoebe," Wow, ooh, you're gonna be making money hand over fist!"
25,Monica," OK, we got the cole slaw, we got the buns..."
26,Phoebe," We've got the ground-up flesh of formerly cute cows and turkeys, ew...
(hands meat to Monica)"
28,Chandler, (in a deep voice) Men are here.
29,Joey, We make fire. Cook meat.
30,Chandler," Then put out fire by peeing, no get invited back."
32,Monica," Oh Joey, Melanie called, said she's gonna be late."
33,Joey," Oh, OK."
34,Phoebe," So how are things going with you two? Is she becoming your
(provocatively) special someone?"
35,Joey," I don't know, she's, uh.... she's pretty great."
36,Monica, Yeah? What does she think of your little science project?
37,Joey," What, you think I'm gonna tell a girl I like that I'm also seeing a cup?"
38,Monica, Man's got a point.
39,Joey," Well, the tough thing is, she really wants to have sex with me."
40,Chandler, Crazy bitch.
41,Joey," Yeah, well, I still got a week left to go in the program, and according to
the rules, if I want to get the money I'm not allowed to conduct any... ersonal
experiments, if you know what I mean."
42,Monica, Joey... we always know what you mean.
44,Phoebe, Hey.
45,Monica, Hey.
46,Ross, Hey. (Phoebe sees his bags)
47,Phoebe, How long did you think this barbecue was gonna last?
48,Ross, I'm going to China. 
49,Phoebe," Jeez, you say one thing, and..."
50,Monica, You're going to China?
51,Ross," Yeah, i-it's for the museum. Someone found a bone, we want the bone, but
they don't want us to have the bone, so I'm going over there to try to persuade them to
give us the bo—it's—it's a whole big bone thing. Anyway, I'm gonna be gone for
like, uh... like a week, so, uh, if you wanna reach me, y-you can't. So here's my
itinerary (hands a sheet of paper to Monica). Um... here's a picture of me... (hands it to
Monica)"
52,Phoebe," Oh, let me see! (takes the picture)"
53,Ross," (to Monica) Could you take it to Carol's every now and then, and show it
to Ben, just so he doesn't forget me?"
54,Monica, Yeah.
56,Phoebe," Hi, Ben. I'm your father. I am... the head. Aaaaaahhhh.... (puts picture
down, sees Ross staring at her) Alright, this barbecue is gonna be very fun."
57,Ross," Hey, is Rachel here? Um, I wanted to wish her a happy birthday before I
left."
58,Monica," Oh no, she's out having drinks with Carl."
59,Ross," Oh. (pause) Hey, who's Carl?"
60,Monica," You know, that guy she met at the coffeehouse."
61,Ross, No.
62,Phoebe," Oh, well, see, there's this guy she met at the..."
63,Ross," At the coffeehouse, right."
64,Phoebe," So you do know who he is! (laughs, Ross stares at her) Sorry."
65,Ross," OK, I'm gonna go say goodbye to the guys."
66,Phoebe," Oh, hey, y'know what? Tell them that bone story."
68,Ross, Hi.
69,Joey, Hey!
70,Chandler, Hey!
71,Ross, (sigh)....I have to go to China.
72,Joey, The country?
73,Ross," No no, this big pile of dishes in my mom's breakfront. Do you guys know
who Carl is?"
74,Chandler," Uh, let's see... Alvin... Simon... Theodore.... no."
75,Ross," Well, Rachel's having drinks with him tonight."
76,Joey, Oh no! How can she do that when she's never shown any interest in you?!?
77,Chandler, Forget about her.
78,Joey," He's right, man. Please. Move on. Go to China. Eat Chinese food."
79,Chandler," Course there, they just call it food."
80,Ross," Yeah... I guess. I don't—I don't know. Alright, just... just give her
this for me, OK? (gives Chandler a gift for Rachel)"
81,Joey," Listen, buddy, we're just looking out for you."
82,Ross, I know.
83,Joey," We want you to be happy. And I may only have a couple beers in me, but...
I love you, man. (Joey gives Ross a hug)"
84,Chandler, I'm still on my first. I just think you're nice.
87,Joey," Like the three musketeers, only with fruit."
88,Chandler, (sarcastic) Ooooh. (looks dumbfounded at Joey's stupidity)
89,Monica," (gets up) OK, how does everybody like their burgers?"
90,Rachel," Oh, no, no, no. Presents first. Food later. (walks into living room)"
92,Monica," Hey, hold on there, tiger. How's it going? How you holding up?"
93,Joey," Well, not so good. She definitely thinks tonight is the night we're
gonna... complete the transaction, if you know what I..."
95,Joey," Then you do. Heh, heh."
96,Monica," So, uh, have you ever thought about being there for her?"
97,Joey, What do you mean?
98,Monica," Y'know, just be there for her."
100,Joey, Not following you.
101,Monica, Think about it.
103,Rachel," OK, I'm guessing this is from..."
105,Rachel," Well, thank you, Melanie."
106,Chandler," (pointing out a gift) OK, this one right here is from me."
107,Rachel," (picks it up) OK... ah, it's light... (shakes it)...it rattles...
it's... (opens it) Travel Scrabble! Oooohhh, thank you! (she gives it back to him)"
109,Rachel," This one's from Joey... feels like a book. Thinks it's a book... feels
like a book. And...(opens it)...it's a book!"
110,Phoebe," Oh, it's Dr. Seuss!"
111,Joey, (to Rachel) That book got me through some tough times.
113,Chandler," Yes, the doctors say if they remove it, he'll die."
115,Rachel, Who's this from?
116,Chandler," Oh, that's Ross's. "
117,Rachel, Oh... (opens it)... (sees it is a pin) Oh my God. He remembered.
118,Phoebe, Remembered what?
119,Rachel," It was like months ago. We were walking by this antique store, and I saw
this pin in the window, and I told him it was just like one my grandmother had when I was
a little girl. Oh! I can't believe he remembered!"
120,Chandler," Well, sure, but can you play it on a plane? (pats his Travel
Scrabble game)"
121,Phoebe," Oh, it's so pretty. This must have cost him a fortune."
122,Monica, I can't believe he did this.
123,Chandler," Come on, Ross? Remember back in college, when he fell in love with
Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?"
125,Rachel, What did you just say?
126,Chandler, (panicked) ahem... um... Crystal duck.
127,Rachel," No, no, no.... the, um, the... 'love' part?"
128,Chandler, (stuttering incoherently) F-hah.... flennin....
129,Rachel, Oh.... my God.
130,Chandler," (rubbing his temples) Oh, no-no-no-no-no...."
131,Joey," (pats Chandler on the leg) That's good, just keep rubbing your head.
That'll turn back time."
134,Rachel," I mean, this is unbelievable."
135,Phoebe," I know. This is really, really huge."
136,Chandler, No it's not. It's small. It's tiny. It's petite. It's wee.
137,Phoebe," Nuh-uh. I don't think any of our lives are ever gonna be the same ever
again."
138,Chandler," OK, is there a mute button on this woman?"
139,Monica," I think this is so great! I mean, you and Ross! D-did you have any idea?"
140,Rachel," No! None! I mean, my first night in the city, he mentioned something
about asking me out, but nothing ever happened, so I just... (to Joey) W-well, what else
did he say? I mean, does he, like, want to go out with me?"
141,Joey," Well, given that he's desperately in love with you, he probably wouldn't
mind getting a cup of coffee or something."
142,Rachel," Ross? All this time? Well, I've got to talk to him. (gets up to leave)"
143,Chandler, (quickly) H-He's in China!
144,Joey, The country.
145,Monica," No, no, wait. (checks Ross's itinerary) His flight doesn't leave for
another forty-five more minutes."
146,Chandler, What about the time difference?
147,Monica, From here to the airport?
148,Chandler, Yes! (Rachel walks towards door) You're never gonna make it!
149,Monica," Rachel, what're you gonna say to him?"
150,Rachel, I-I-I don't know.
151,Chandler, Well then maybe you shouldn't go. 
152,Joey," He's right, cause if you're just gonna, like, break his heart, that's the
kind of thing that can wait."
153,Monica," Yeah, but if it's good news, you should tell him now."
154,Rachel, I don't know. Maybe I'll know when I see him.
155,Phoebe," Here, look, alright, does this help?"
157,Rachel," Noooo... look, all I know is that I cannot wait a week until I see him.
I mean, this is just too big. Y'know, I just, I've just gotta talk to him. I... I gotta...
OK, I'll see you later. (opens door)"
158,Chandler," Rachel, I love you! Deal with me first! (she leaves)"
160,Ross, (something in Chinese)
162,Ross, Ni-chou chi-ma! (walks onto jetway)
164,Rachel," Ross! Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me...."
167,Rachel, Hi.
169,Rachel," Oh, no, no, I don't have one. I just need to talk to my friend."
171,Rachel," No, I know, but I—he just went on. He's right there, he's got the
blue jacket on, I... can I j-just..."
173,Rachel," OK, alright, OK, um... then could you please, uh... just give him a
message for me? Please? This is very important."
175,Rachel, Uh... I don't know.
183,Joey," Heh, heh. It was nothin'."
185,Joey," (panicked) Uhhh.. y'know what? Forget about me. Let's, uh... let's give
you another turn."
187,Joey, Sure! Why not?
191,Joey, How do you mean?
194,Monica," Uh, so, uh, Rach, uh... do you wanna save this wrapping paper, I mean,
it's only a little bit torn... so are you gonna go for it with Ross or should I just throw
it out?"
195,Rachel," I don't know. I don't know... I thought about it all the way there, and
I thought about it all the way back... and, uh, oh, you guys, y'know, it's Ross.
Y'know what I mean? I mean, it's Ross."
197,Rachel," I don't know, I mean, this is just my initial gut feeling... but I'm
thinking... oh, I'm thinking it'd be really great."
198,Monica," Oh my God, me too! Oh! Oh, we'd be like friends-in-law! Y'know what the
best part is? The best part is that you already know everything about him! I mean, it's
like starting on the fifteenth date!"
199,Phoebe," Yeah, but, y'know, it's... it would be like starting on the fifteenth
date."
200,Monica, Another good point.
201,Phoebe," No, I mean, I mean, when you're at the fifteenth date, y'know, you're
already in a very relationshippy place. Y'know, it's... you're committed."
202,Rachel, (confused) Huh?
203,Phoebe," Well, I mean, then what happens if it doesn't work out?"
204,Monica, Why isn't it working out?
205,Rachel, I don't know... sometimes it doesn't.
206,Monica, Is he not cute enough for you?
207,Rachel, No!
208,Monica, Does he not make enough money?
209,Rachel," No, I'm just...."
210,Phoebe, Maybe there's someone else.
211,Rachel, Wha...
212,Monica, Is there? Is there someone else?
213,Rachel, No! There is.. there is noone else!
214,Monica, Then why the hell are you dumping my brother?!?
216,Chandler," Hey, big..."
217,Joey, Shhhh!
218,Chandler, (quietly) ...spender.
219,Joey, She's still asleep.
220,Chandler, So how'd it go?
221,Joey," Oh, it was amazing. You know how you always think you're great in bed?"
222,Chandler," The fact that you'd even ask that question shows how little you know
me."
223,Joey," Well, it's like, last night, I couldn't do the thing that usually makes me
great. So I had to do all this other stuff. And the response I got... man, oh man, it was
like a ticker tape parade!"
224,Chandler," Yes, I know, as it happens my room is very very close to the parade
route."
225,Joey," It was amazing! And not just for her... uh-uh. For me, too. It's like, all
of a sudden, I'm blind. But all my other senses are heightened, y'know? It's like... I was
able to appreciate it on another level."
226,Chandler, I didn't know you had another level.
227,Joey, I know! Neither did I!
229,Monica," Hey, great skirt! Birthday present?"
230,Rachel, Yeah.
231,Monica," Oh, from who?"
232,Rachel, From you. I exchanged the blouse you got me.
233,Monica," Well, it's the thought. Hey, doesn't Ross's flight get in in a couple
hours? At gate 27-B?"
234,Rachel," Uh, yeah. Uh, Monica, y'know, honey, I've been thinking about it and
I've decided this—this whole Ross thing, it's just not a good idea."
235,Monica," Oh, why?"
236,Rachel," Because, I feel like I wouldn't just be going out with him. I would be
going out with all of you. Oh, and there would just be all this pressure, and I don't
wanna..."
237,Monica," (gets up) No, no, no, no, no, no pressure, no pressure!"
238,Rachel," Monica, nothing has even happened yet, and you're already so..."
239,Monica," I am not 'so'! OK, I was a teensy bit weird at first, but... I'll be
good. I promise."
241,Rachel, Who is it?
243,Rachel, C'mon up.
244,Monica," Behind my brother's back? (Rachel glares at her) ... is exactly the kind
of crazy thing you won't be hearing from me."
246,Joey, Seven hundred bucks!
247,Chandler," Alright, you did it! Do we have any fruit?"
248,Joey," Man, hell of a two weeks, huh? Y'know what, though? I really feel like I
learned something."
249,Chandler," Really? So, you're gonna stick with this 'it's all for her' thing?"
250,Joey," What, are you crazy? When a blind man gets his sight back, does he walk
around like this? (Joey closes his eyes and walks around with arms spread.)"
254,Ross, I can't believe you'd rather go out with him than me.
255,Rachel," Would you excuse me, please? I'm trying to have a date here."
256,Ross," Fine, just stop thinking about me."
258,Ross," Can't do it, can you?"
259,Rachel, So I'm thinking about you. So what?
260,Ross," I don't get it. What do you see in this guy, anyway?"
261,Rachel, Well... he happens to be a very nice... guy....
263,Ross," Rachel, come on. Give us a chance."
264,Rachel," Ross, it's too hard."
265,Ross," No, no, no... why, because it might get weird for everyone else? Who cares
about them. This is about us. Look, I-I've been in love with you since, like, the ninth
grade. "
266,Rachel," Ross, you're like my best friend."
267,Ross, I know.
268,Rachel," If we broke up, and I lost you..."
269,Ross," Whoa, whoa, whoa. What makes you think we're gonna break up?"
270,Rachel," Well, have you been involved with someone where you haven't broken up?"
271,Ross," (pause) No. But... it only has to happen once. Look, you and I both
know we are perfect for each other, right? I mean... so, the only question is... are you
attracted to me?"
272,Rachel," I don't know... I mean, I've never looked at you that way before."
273,Ross," Well, start looking. "
275,Rachel, Wow.
277,Rachel, Right! You're right!
279,Rachel, You know what?
281,Rachel," I forgot... I am supposed to pick up a friend at the airport. I am so
sorry! I'm so... if you want to stay, and finish your drinks, please do.... (gives him her
drink) I mean—I'm sorry. I-I-I gotta go. I'm sorry. "
285,Rachel," (sifting through crowd) Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me, excuse me,
sorry. Hi."
289,Ross," Oh, hey, hey, I got that."
292,Ross, No problem. I cannot wait for you to meet my friends.
294,Ross, Yeah. 
296,Ross," No, no, they will. I just... uh..."
298,Ross," Come on, they're gonna love you."
0,Phoebe," Ok, so this is pretty much what's happened so far. Ross was in love with
Rachel since, you know, forever, but every time he tried to tell her, something kind of
got in the way, like cats, and Italian guys. Finally Chandler was like ""forget about
her"" but when Ross was in China on his dig, Chandler let it slip that Ross was in
love with Rachel. She was like, ""Oh my god."" So she went to the airport to meet
him when he came back, but what she didn't know was, that Ross was getting off the plane
with another woman. Uh-Oh! So, that's pretty much everything you need to know. But, enough
about us. So, how've you been?"
3,Rachel," Oh my god. Oh my god. (She decides to make a break for it.) Excuse me.
Move! Move! Emergency! Excuse me! (She tries climbing over a bench and falls down.) "
4,Ross, (seeing her) Rach!
5,Rachel," Oh, there you are! Hi! Oh, so, so, how was China, you? (Hits him with
the flowers.)"
6,Ross," It was, it was great. Oh, what happened?"
7,Rachel, What?
8,Ross, You're bleeding. 
9,Rachel," I am? Oh, look at that, yes I am. Enough about me, enough about me, Mr.
Back from the Orient. Come on. I wanna hear everything! Everything. (Looks at Julie)"
10,Ross," Well, where do I start? This is Julie. Julie, this is Rachel."
11,Rachel," These are, these aren't for you. (to Julie) These are for you. (Loudly,
thinking she can't speak English.) Welcome to our country."
13,Rachel," Ok, well, not a problem. We'll just use them to stop the bleeding. Ok.
Baggage claim? Ok."
15,Chandler,  No way!
16,Monica," I'm telling you, she went to the airport, and she's gonna go for it with
Ross! "
17,Phoebe," Oh my god. This is huge. This is bigger than huge. This is like, all
right, what's bigger than huge?"
18,Joey," Um, this?"
19,Phoebe, Yes.
20,Monica," Guys, you got your hair cut."
21,Chandler," Yes, yes, we did, thanks to Vidal Buffay."
22,Phoebe," 'Cause, you know, (in that voice) if you don't look good, we don't look
good. I love that voice."
23,Rachel," (entering, out of breath) Airport, airport. Ross, not alone, Julie, arm
around her. Cramp, cramp."
24,Chandler," Ok, I think she's trying to tell us something. Quick, get the verbs."
26,Rachel," (to Chandler) You, you, you said he liked me. (Ross and Julie enter)
You, you slowpokes!"
27,Ross," That's all right, Rach, we got the bags. Hi, hello. Julie, this is my
sister Monica. This is Chandler.  Phoebe.  Joey, what up?"
28,Joey, What up?!
29,Ross," Everyone, this is Julie."
30,Rachel, (out of breath) Julie.
33,Ross, And bus.
35,Ross,  The screaming guy?
37,Ross, You gotta hear this story.
39,Ross, 200 at least.
41,Rachel," And the chicken pooped in her lap. Oh, I'm so sorry. I just gave away
the ending, didn't I? Oh! It's just, I just heard this story in the cab, and it is all I
can think about."
42,Monica," This is amazing. I mean, how, how did this happen?"
44,Ross," But we haven't seen each other since then. Well I land in China, guess
who's in charge of the dig. "
45,Rachel," Julie! Julie, isn't that great? I mean, isn't that just
kick-you-in-the-crotch, spit-on-your-neck fantastic?"
46,Monica, (to Julie) It's an expression.
47,Ross," Well, we just wanted to say a quick hi, and then we're gonna go see the
baby."
49,Ross," Yeah, it's really 600 tomorrow night our time."
50,Chandler," Well, listen, don't tell us what's gonna happen though, 'cause I like
to be surprised."
52,Rachel, Bye. (She closes the door and everyone tries to sympathize with her.)
54,Ross," Hey, Rach, can I get some coffee?"
55,Rachel," Yeah, sure."
56,Ross, Thank you.
57,Chandler," Hey, Rach, can I get..."
58,Rachel, Did you talk to him?
59,Chandler, Not yet.
60,Rachel," Then, no."
62,Chandler," So what the hell happened to you in China? I mean, when last we left
you, you were totally in love with, you know."
63,Ross," I know, I know I was, but there was always this little voice inside that
kept saying it's never gonna happen, move on. You know whose voice that was?"
64,Chandler, God?
65,Ross," It was you, pal."
66,Chandler," Well, maybe it was God, doing me."
67,Ross," Look, you were right. She looks at me and sees a friend, that's all. But
then I met Julie, and I don't know, we're havin' a great time. And I have to say, I never
would've gone for it with her if it hadn't been for you."
68,Chandler," Well, you owe me one, big guy."
69,Rachel, (To Ross) Here's your lemonade.
70,Ross, I didn't order lemonade.
71,Rachel," Oh. Well then, you better go take that back because they're gonna charge
you for that. "
72,Ross, But...
73,Rachel," Go-go-go-go, come on! (Ross goes over to the counte) (to Chandler) So
uh, what did you find out?"
74,Chandler," He said...he said, he said that they're having a great time. I'm
sorry. But, the silver lining, if you wanna see it, is that he made the decision all by
himself!  Without any outside help whatsoever."
75,Rachel, How is that the silver lining?
76,Chandler, You have to really wanna see it.
78,Ross," Ironically, these are the guys who were picked last in gym."
80,Monica," Pheebes, you know what I'm thinking?"
81,Phoebe," Oh, ok. How, it's been so long since you've had sex, you're wondering if
they've changed it?"
82,Monica," No, although now that's what I'm thinking."
83,Phoebe," All right, so what were you thinking?"
84,Monica," Well, I was thinking, that you gave the guys such great haircuts, I
thought, maybe you'd like to do mine?"
85,Phoebe, Ohh! No.
86,Monica, Why not?
87,Phoebe," Because, I'm just, I'm incredibly anal and an unbelievable control
freak."
88,Monica, No you're not.
89,Phoebe," I know I'm not, but you are, and I was trying to spare your feelings."
91,Joey," (answering the phone) Hello? Oh, hi. Yeah, hold on a second. Ross, it's
Julie, for you. (Throws him the phone.)"
92,Ross, (on phone) Hello? Hi.
93,Chandler, (entering) Hi. Anybody know a good tailor?
94,Joey, Needs some clothes altered?
95,Chandler," No, no, I'm just looking for a man to draw on me with chalk."
96,Joey," Why don't you go see Frankie? My family's been goin' to him forever. He
did my first suit when I was 15. No wait, 16. No, 'scuse me, 15. (still confused) All
right, when was 1990?"
97,Chandler, Okay.  You have to stop the Q-tip when there's resistance!
98,Ross," (on phone) Ok, ok, sweetheart, I'll see you later. Ok, bye. What? (Sits
down next to Rachel) Oh, that is so sweet. No, no, ok, you hang up. Ok, ok, one, two,
three. (Doesn't hang up and motions for Rachel to be quiet) Well you didn't hang up
either. "
99,Rachel, She didn't hang up either!
100,Ross," Ok, no, no, you hang up. You, you, y..."
101,Rachel," (taking the phone and hanging it up) Sorry, I thought you were talking
to me."
102,Ross, Rachel! I'll just call her back. 
103,Rachel, Okay!
104,Ross," (calls Julie back) Hi?  Sorry, we got disconnected... (Walks away.)"
105,Rachel," (to Monica) Ok, ok, ok. How did this happen to me? How did this happen
to me? A week ago, two weeks ago, I was fine. Ross was just Ross, just this guy. Now he's
Rrrooossss, oh, this really great guy that I can't have."
106,Monica," Sweetie, I wanted you to have him too."
107,Rachel," I know you did. I'm just gonna deal with it, I'm just gonna deal with
it. (Ross comes by, smoching with Julie on the phone.) I gotta get out of here. (Exits)"
108,Chandler," Ok, I don't care what you guys say, something's bothering her."
110,Joey," (to Chandler) You know, I think I was sixteen."
111,Monica," (to Phoebe) Please, just a little bit off the back."
112,Phoebe," I'm still on ""no."""
113,Rachel," (poking her head in from her bedroom) Uh, morning. Do you guys think you
could close your eyes for just a sec?"
114,Joey," No-no-no-no-no, (grabs his pants) I'm not fallin' for that again."
115,Phoebe, What's goin' on?
116,Rachel," Well, I sorta did a stupid thing last night."
117,Chandler, What stupid thing did you do?
119,Phoebe, Ewww! (Gets up and walks away.)
122,Rachel," Ok, Paulo, why don't you just go get dressed, and then you be on your
way, ok, bye-bye. (Paulo goes into his room.)"
123,Monica," Rachel, how did this happen?"
124,Rachel," I don't know, I just kinda ran into him last night."
125,Phoebe, Where?
126,Rachel, At his apartment. Is this juice?
127,Joey," Whoa, whoa. And the fact that you dumped him because he hit on Phoebe?"
128,Rachel," Oh God, I know I'm a pathetic loser."
129,Monica," Honey, you're not pathetic, you're sad."
130,Chandler, People do stupid things when they're upset.
131,Monica," My god, if I had a nickel for every guy I wish I hadn't...(Everyone
looks at her), but this is about your horrible mistake."
134,Ross," Hi. Sorry we're late but we were—well, there was touching."
136,Ross," Hey, Paulo. What are you doing here?"
138,Ross," (to Rachel) So, uh, he's back."
139,Rachel," Yeah, he's back. Is that a problem?"
140,Ross," No, not a problem."
141,Rachel, Good! I'm glad it's not a problem.
142,Phoebe," (to Paulo) Ok, you're gonna have to not touch my ass."
143,Chandler," Well, in spite of the yummy bagels and palpable tension, I've got
pants that need to be altered."
144,Joey," Hey, Chandler, when you see Frankie, tell him Joey Tribbiani says hello.
He'll know what it means."
145,Chandler, Are you sure he's gonna be able to crack that code?
146,Monica," (to Phoebe) You know it's funny, the last time Paulo was here, my hair
was so much shorter and cuter."
147,Phoebe," All right. Ok, but, but!  You have to promise that you will not be
all like control-y and bossy and Monica about it."
148,Monica, I promise.
149,Phoebe," All right. (Talking to Monica's hair.) Now some of you are gonna get
cut, and some of you aren't. But I promise none of you are gonna feel a thing."
151,Phoebe," All right, that's it, I quit."
152,Monica, What? I didn't say anything.
153,Phoebe," Yeah, but this (makes Monica's face) isn't the face of a person who
trusts a person. Ok, this (makes Monica's face) is the face of a person who, you know,
doesn't trust a person."
154,Monica," I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Phoebe. It's just a little shorter than what we
had discussed."
155,Phoebe, Would you relax? I know what I am doing. This is how he wears it.
156,Monica, How who wears it?
157,Phoebe, Demi Moore.
158,Monica, Demi Moore is not a he.
159,Phoebe," Well, he was a he in Arthur, and in Ten."
160,Monica, That's Dudley Moore. I said I wanted it like Demi Moore.
161,Phoebe, Oh.  Oh!
162,Monica, Oh my God!
163,Phoebe, Oh my God!
164,Monica, Oh my God!
165,Phoebe," Oh my God! I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Which one's Demi Moore?"
166,Monica," She's the actress that was in Disclosure, Indecent
Proposal, Ghost!"
167,Phoebe," Oh, she's got gorgeous hair."
168,Monica, I know!
171,Chandler, At least as long as I have the pants.
176,Rachel, How is she?
177,Phoebe," It's too soon to tell. She's resting, which is a good sign."
178,Ross, How's the hair?
179,Phoebe," I'm not gonna lie to you, Ross, it doesn't look good. I put a clip on
one side, which seems to have stopped the curling."
180,Joey, Can we see her?
181,Phoebe," Your hair looks too good, I think it would upset her. Ross, why don't
you come on in. "
182,Ross,"  Yeah. (Gets up, but then pauses when he realizes what that
meant.)"
184,Joey, How're you doing?
185,Rachel, I'm okay.
186,Joey," Ooh, that bad, huh? "
187,Rachel, What?
188,Joey," Look, I can sense when women are depressed and vulnerable. It's
one of my gifts."
189,Rachel," When I saw him get off that plane with her, I really thought I hit rock
bottom. But today, it's like there's rock bottom, 50 feet of crap, then me."
190,Joey, You gotta tell Ross how you feel.
191,Rachel, Come on. How can I just tell him? What about Julie?
192,Joey," What about her? They've only been going out for two weeks. Ross has been
in love with you for like 10 years."
193,Rachel," I don't know, I don't know."
194,Joey," Look, Rach, Rach! I've been with my share of women. In fact, I've been
with like a lot of people's share of women. The point is, I've never felt about anyone the
way Ross felt about you."
195,Chandler," (entering, angry) Yo, paisan! Can I talk to you for a sec? (Pause)
Your tailor is a very bad man!"
196,Joey, Frankie? What're you talking about?
197,Ross," (entering from the bedroom) Hey, what's goin' on? (Pats Chandler on the
shoulder which causes him to jump.)"
198,Chandler, Joey's tailor...took advantage of me.
199,Ross, What?
200,Joey, No way. I've been going to the guy for 12 years.
201,Chandler," Oh come on! He said he was going to do my inseam, and he ran his hand
up my leg, and then, there was definite..."
202,Ross, What?
203,Chandler, Cupping.
204,Joey," That's how they do pants! First they go up one side, they move it over,
then they go up the other side, they move it back, and then they do the rear. (Chandler
and Ross stare at him) What? Ross, Ross, would you tell him? Isn't that how they measure
pants?"
205,Ross," Yes, yes it is. In prison! Whatsa matter with you?"
206,Joey, What? That's not? (Realizes) Oh my God.
208,Monica, Even Mary Tyler Moore would've been better.
209,Ross," I like it. I do, I think it's a Ten. (Chandler laughs.)"
210,Monica, Thank you. My hair is very amused.
211,Chandler," Come on, Monica, things could be worse. You could get caught between
the moon and New York City. I know it's crazy, but it's true."
212,Phoebe, (to Chandler and Ross) Thank you.
213,Ross," Well, I gotta go. Bye. Bye, Rach."
214,Rachel," (sticking her head in from the balcony) Wait, are you leaving?"
215,Ross," Yeah, that's kinda what I meant by ""bye!"""
216,Rachel," Well, can I talk to you for a sec? "
217,Ross, Okay. (goes out onto the balcony)
218,Joey," Hey, when the doctor does that hernia test..."
219,Chandler, That's ok.
221,Ross, What's goin' on?
222,Rachel," Well, first of all, Paulo and I are not back together. It was just a
stupid thing I did, and if I could go back in time and do it again, well, I wouldn't. Um,
second of all (Ross is laughing), what?"
223,Ross," Ok. Well, before I say anything, I just need to know, is this one of those
things where you break up with a guy, and then I tell you what I think, and then the next
day you get back together with the guy, and I look like a complete idiot?"
224,Rachel, No. No-no-no-no.
225,Ross," Well, then, I think, I think the guy is scum. I hate him. I mean I
actually—I-I physically hate him. I always have. You are way too good to be with a
guy like that. "
226,Rachel, Really?
227,Ross," You deserve to be with someone who appreciates you, and who gets
how funny and sweet and amazing, and adorable, and sexy you are, you know? Someone who
wakes up every morning thinking ""Oh my god, I'm with Rachel"". You know, someone
who makes you feel good, the way I am with Julie. (Rachel has moved closer, but hearing
that she starts to back up.) Was there a second of all?"
228,Rachel," No, I think that was the whole all."
229,Ross, Okay.  Okay. (They hug.) Okay.
231,Joey," I swear to god, Dad. That's not how they measure pants."
235,Phoebe," Oh yeah!  Oh, I can do that."
237,Phoebe, You wanna do it right now?
239,Phoebe," (to Rachel) Ok, I just wanna be really sure this time. Andie McDowell's
the girl from Four Weddings and a Funeral, right?"
240,Rachel," No. No no no no no. That's Rodney McDowell. Andie McDowell is the guy
from Planet of the Apes."
241,Phoebe," Oh, yeah. Ok, thank you."
242,Rachel, You're welcome.
0,Monica," (entering from her bedroom carrying a present) Ok, these were
unbelievably expensive, and I know he's gonna grow out of them in like, 20 minutes, but I
couldn't resist. (There a little pair of Nike shoes.)"
1,Phoebe," Oh, look at these! Hey, Ben. Just do it. (Ben starts to cry) Oh my God,
oh, ok, was that too much pressure for him?"
4,Chandler," You know, it's... (sees the feeding taking place next to him)
something funny about sneakers. I'll be right back. (Goes into the kitchen)"
5,Joey," (joins him) I gotta get one, too."
6,Ross, (following them into the kitchen) What are you guys doing?
7,Chandler, We're just hanging out by the spoons. Ladle?
8,Ross," Look, would you guys grow up? That is the most natural beautiful thing in
the world."
9,Joey," Yeah, we know, but there's a baby suckin' on it."
10,Ross," This is my son having lunch, ok? It's gonna happen a lot, so you'd better
get used to it. Now if you have any problem with it, if you're uncomfortable, just ask
questions. Carol's fine with it, now come on."
12,Ross, Carol?
13,Chandler," Carol? I was just wondering if Joey could ask you a question about
breast-feeding?"
15,Joey," Uh, does it hurt?"
17,Joey, Chandler?
18,Chandler," So, uh, how often can you do it?"
20,Joey," Ok, I got one, I got one. Uh, if he blows into one, does the other one get
bigger?"
24,Rachel," Yeah, I forget which ones."
28,Rachel, (to Julie) Thank you. (under her breath to Chandler) What a bitch.
30,Phoebe," I can't, I have to take my grandmother to the vet."
31,Monica," Ok, um, I'll go with you. "
33,Ross," (enters) Hi, honey."
34,Chandler," Hey, sweetums."
35,Ross, Hello to the rest.
37,Joey," Monica what're you doin'? You can't go shopping with her? What about
Rachel?"
38,Monica," It's gonna be a problem, isn't it?"
39,Chandler," Come on, you're going to Bloomingdale's with Julie? That's
like cheating on Rachel in her house of worship."
40,Monica, But I'm...
41,Phoebe," Monica, she will kill you. She will kill you like a dog in the street."
42,Ross," (to Monica) So, uh, Jules tells me you guys are going shopping tomorrow?"
43,Monica," Yeah, uh, it's actually not that big a deal."
44,Ross," It's a big deal to me. This is great, Monica. I really appreciate this."
45,Monica, You're welcome.
46,Phoebe," Woof, woof. "
48,Joey," (A guy walks by) Bijan for men? (Another guy walks by) Bijan for men?
(Another guy walks by) Bijan for men? (An attractive woman walks by.) Hey
Annabelle."
50,Joey, Who?
54,Joey, What's he doin' in my section?
56,Joey," Well, he's gonna. I'll see you a little later, ok? (To the Hombre Man)
Hey, how ya doin'?"
58,Joey," Listen, I know you're new, but it's kinda understood that everything from
Young Men's to the escalator is my territory."
60,Joey, Yeah. Bijan for men?
66,Monica," Phoebe, listen. You were with me, and we were shopping all day."
67,Phoebe, What?
68,Monica," We were shopping, and we had lunch."
69,Phoebe," Oh, all right. What did I have?"
70,Monica, You had a salad.
71,Phoebe," Oh, no wonder I don't feel full."
72,Rachel," (entering) Hey, guys, what's up."
73,Phoebe," I went shopping with Monica all day, and I had a salad."
74,Rachel," Good, Pheebs. What'd you buy?"
75,Phoebe," Um, we went shopping for um, for, fur."
76,Rachel, You went shopping for fur?
77,Phoebe," Yes, and then I realized I'm against that, and uh, so then we bought
some, (sees Monica pointing at her chest) uh, boobs."
78,Rachel, You bought boobs?
79,Phoebe," (Monica is yanking on her bra strap) Bras! We bought bras! We bought
bras. "
81,Joey," (to a guy) Bijan for men? (to a guy) Bijan for men? (To a woman) Bijan
for... (Sees it's a woman and stops.) (To Annabelle who walks up.) Hey, Annabelle, Uh,
listen, I was wondering if maybe after work you and I could go maybe grab a cup of coffee."
85,Joey," (To a co-worker) Hey, it's not the first time I lost a girl to a cowboy
spraying cologne. (A customer walks by.) Bijan for men? (The customer ignores him, and
Joey starts to chase him) Bijan for men?! "
88,Ross," Carol, we've been through this before, ok? We have a good time. We laugh,
we play. It's like we're father and son."
90,Rachel," Oh, this is so cute."
92,Ross, My mommies love me. That's clever.
93,Monica," Hello? Oh, Hi, Ju—(Sees Rachel is watching)—Hi, Jew! (Walks
into the kitchen.) (Listens.) Uh huh? (Listens.) Uh huh? (Listens) Ok. (Listens) Um, sure,
that'd be great. See ya then. Bye. (Hangs up.)"
94,Rachel," Did you just say Hi, Jew?"
95,Monica," Yes. Uh, yes, I did. That was my friend, Eddie Moskowitz. Yeah, he likes
it. Reaffirms his faith."
97,Phoebe," Ben, dinner!"
98,Ross," Thanks Aunt Pheebs. Hey, you didn't microwave that, did you, because it's
breast milk, and you're not supposed to do that."
99,Phoebe," Duh, I think I know how to heat breast milk. Ok. (Squirts some on her
wrist and tastes it.)"
100,Chandler, What did you just do?
101,Phoebe," I licked my arm, what?"
102,Ross, It's breast milk.
103,Phoebe, So?
104,Rachel," Phoebe, that is juice, squeezed from a person."
105,Joey, What is the big deal? (Tastes the breast milk.)
106,Chandler, What did you just do?
107,Ross," Ok, would people stop drinking the breast milk?"
108,Phoebe, You won't even taste it?
109,Ross, No!
110,Phoebe, Not even if you just pretend that it's milk?
111,Ross, Not even if Carol's breast had a picture of a missing child on it.
113,Monica," Hey, where is everybody?"
114,Rachel, They took Ben to the park. Where've you been?
115,Monica," Just out. Had some lunch, just me, little quality time with me. Thanks
for your jacket."
116,Rachel," Oh, no problem. You can borrow it, by the way. (Puts her hand in the
pocket) Here are your keys, hon. (She takes the keys out, sets them on the counter, and
notices she also grabbed a receipt.)"
117,Monica, Okay.
118,Rachel," Mon, if uh you were at lunch alone, how come it cost you uh 53
dollars?"
119,Monica, You know what probably happened? Someone musta stolen my credit card.
120,Rachel, And sorta just put the receipt back in your pocket?
121,Monica, That is an excellent excellent question. That is excellent.
122,Rachel," Monica, what is with you? Who'd you have lunch with?"
123,Monica, Judy.
124,Rachel, Who?
125,Monica, Julie.
126,Rachel, What?!
127,Monica, Jody!
128,Rachel, You were with Julie?
129,Monica," Look, when it started I was just trying to be nice to her because she
was my brother's girlfriend. And then, one thing led to another and, before I knew it, we
were...shopping."
130,Rachel, Oh. Oh my God. 
131,Monica," Honey, wait. We only did it once. It didn't mean anything to me."
132,Rachel," Yeah, right.  Sure!"
133,Monica," Really, Rachel, I was thinking of you the whole time. Look, I'm sorry,
all right. I never meant for you to find out!"
134,Rachel," Oh, please, you wanted to get caught. (Waves the receipt)"
135,Monica, That is not true!
136,Rachel," Oh, so you just sort of happened to leave it in here?"
137,Monica, Did it ever occur to you that I might just be that stupid?
138,Rachel," Ok, Monica. I just have to know one thing. Did you go with her to Bloomingdale's?
(Monica looks away.) Oh! Ok, ok, ok, I just really, uh, I just really need to not be with
you right now. (Exits.)"
141,Monica," (on the phone) Hi, who's this? (Listens) Hi, Joanne. Is Rachel working?
It's Monica. (Listens) Yes, I know I did a horrible thing. (Listens) Joanne, it's not as
simple as all that, ok? (Listens) No, I don't care what Steve thinks. (Listens) Hi, Steve."
145,Phoebe," Oh, I tasted Ben's milk, and Ross freaked out."
146,Ross, I did not freak out. 
148,Ross, Because it's breast milk. It's gross.
151,Ross," No, no, Carol. There's nothing wrong with it. I just, I just don't think
breast milk is for adults."
152,Chandler, Of course the packaging does appeal to grown-ups and kids alike.
154,Ross, (jumping away) That would be no.
155,Phoebe, Come on. It doesn't taste bad.
156,Joey," Yeah, it's kinda sweet, sorta like, uh..."
158,Joey, Exactly.
159,Ross, (staring at Susan) You've tasted it? You've tasted it.
161,Ross," Oh, you've tasted it."
163,Ross," (he rolls up his sleeve) Gimme the bottle. (Joey hands him the bottle and
Ross squirts some on his arm.) Gimme the towel. (Joey gives him the towel and he wipes it
off.) "
165,Chandler, Howdy.
166,Joey," (sitting on the otherside of the counter from Chandler) Gimme a box a
juice. Well, they switched me over to Hombre."
167,Chandler," Well, maybe it's because of the way you're dressed."
168,Joey," Or maybe it's because this guy's doing so good they wanna put more people
on it. (Chandler pours some juice in a glass.) You should see this guy, Chandler, he goes
through two bottles a day."
169,Chandler," (slides the juice across the counter which Joey catches) What do you
care? You're an actor. This is your day job. This isn't supposed to mean anything to you."
170,Joey," I know, but, I was the best, you know? I liked being the best. (He downs
the glass of juice in one swig.) I don't know. Maybe I should just get outta the game.
They need guys up in housewares to serve cheese."
171,Chandler," (pours more and slides the refill to Joey) All right, say you do that.
You know sooner or later somebody's gonna come along that slices a better cheddar. And
then where're you gonna run?"
172,Joey, Yeah I guess you're right.
173,Chandler," You're damn right I'm right. I say you show this guy what you're made
of. I say you stand your ground. I say you show him that you are the baddest hombre west
of the lingerie."
174,Joey, I'm gonna do it. (He downs the juice in one swig again.)
175,Chandler," All right. Now go see Miss Kitty and she'll fix you up with a nice
hooker."
177,Monica, I don't know what else to say.
178,Rachel," Well that works out good, because I'm not listening."
179,Monica," I feel terrible, I really do."
180,Rachel," Oh, I'm sorry, did my back hurt your knife?"
181,Monica," Rachel, (they go back inside) say that I'm friends with her, we spend
some time together. Is that so terrible?"
182,Rachel, Yes.
183,Monica, It's that terrible?
184,Rachel," Yes. Monica, you don't get it. It's bad enough that she's stolen the guy
who might actually be the person that I am supposed to be with, but now, she's actually
(starting to cry), but now she's actually stealing you."
185,Monica," Me? What are you talking about? Nobody could steal me from you. I mean,
just because I'm friends with her doesn't make me any less friends with you. I mean,
(starting to cry) you're my...We're, we're...Oh, I love you."
186,Rachel, I love you too. (They hug.)
187,Phoebe," You guys, um I know that this really doesn't have anything to do with
me, but um I love you guys too. (Joins in on the hug.) Oh, I really needed that. (Goes and
sits down.)"
188,Monica," Look, I know that you're in a place right now where you really need to
hate Julie's guts, but she didn't do anything wrong. I mean, she was just a girl who met a
guy, and now they go out. I really think that if you gave her a chance, you'd like her.
Would you just give that a chance, for me?"
189,Rachel," (crying) I'd do anything for you, you know that."
190,Monica, (crying) I'd do anything for you. (They hug again.)
191,Phoebe," Wait, wait, wait, wait! (Runs over and joins in on the hug again.)"
193,Joey," Mornin'. (The Hombre man ignores him) I said, mornin'."
197,Joey," Yeah, I'm ready."
203,Joey," These new kids, they never last. Sooner or later, they all...stop lastin'.
Listen, uh, what do you say I buy you that cup of coffee now?"
208,Rachel," So. I just thought the two of us should hang out for a bit. I mean, you
know, we've never really talked. I guess you'd know that, being one of the two of us,
though, right?"
210,Rachel, Really? Me?
212,Rachel," Well, you're not totally paranoid."
214,Rachel," Um, ok, uh, oh god, um, when you and uh Ross first started going out, it
was really hard for me, um, for many reasons, which I'm not gonna bore you with now, but
um, I just, I see how happy he is, you know, and how good you guys are together, and um,
Monica's always saying how nice you are, and god I hate it when she's right."
216,Rachel," Yeah, that'd be great. I'd love it."
218,Rachel," All right, Julie."
220,Rachel, Bye. (After Julie exits.) What a manipulative bitch.
223,Ross, (with a mouthful) That's not bad. 
0,Joey, I'm tellin' ya that girl totally winked at me.
2,Chandler," Huh. (They all leave, dejected)"
5,Ross, I have to say Tupolo Honey by Van Morrison.
6,Rachel, Nooo Way! The most romantic song ever is The Way We Were.
7,Phoebe," See, I-I think that one that Elton John wrote for, um, that guy on Who's
The Boss."
8,Rachel," What song was that, Pheebs?"
9,Phoebe," (singing) Hold me close, young Tony Dan-za."
11,Phoebe, Hi Monica!
12,Ross, Hey Mon!
13,Rachel, Hey Mon!
15,Phoebe," Oh my God, has she slept at all?"
16,Ross, Nope.
17,Rachel," No, it's been three nights in a row."
18,Ross," Yeah, she finally stopped crying yesterday, but then she found one of
Richard's cigar butts out on the terrace, so."
19,Phoebe," Oh, okay that explains it. I got a call at two in the morning, but all I
could hear was, like, this high squeaky sound, so I thought okay its like a mouse or a
opossum. But then I realized where would a mouse or a opossum get the money to make the
phone call."
21,Chandler, Morning.
22,Joey," Morning, hey, you made pancakes?"
23,Chandler," Yeah, like there's any way I could ever do that."
25,Joey, (sarcastically) Good morning.
26,Chandler," Hey, you know what, here's a thought. Why don't you stay home from
work today and just hang out with me."
28,Chandler," I can not believe that I am going out with someone that is getting
divorced. I'm such a grown up."
30,Chandler," Well, maybe I won't kiss you, and then you'll have to stay."
31,Joey, (under his breath) Kiss her! Kiss her!
33,Joey, B-bye Janice. So when ya' dumpin' her.
34,Chandler," Nope, not this time."
35,Joey," Come on, quite yankin' me."
36,Chandler, I'm not yanking you.
37,Joey, This is Janice.
38,Chandler," Yeah, I know. She makes me happy."
39,Joey," Okay. All right. You look me in the eye and tell me, without blinking,
that you're not breaking up with her. No blinking."
40,Chandler," (looks him in the eye) I'm not breaking up with her! (they stare at
each other for a while, then Joey blows in his face)"
42,Monica," God, look what I found in the drain."
43,Rachel, What?!
44,Monica," It's some of Richard's hair! (holds it close to Ross) What do I do with
this?"
45,Ross, Getting it away from me would be job one.
46,Monica," It's weird, but you know what I don't wanna throw this away. I mean this
is like all I have left of him, gross, drain hair. Ooh! (drops it in Ross's cereal)"
47,Phoebe," Ooh. Oh. It looks like, like a tiny little person drowning in your
cereal. (Ross gives her this look, like 'Yeah, doesn't it', and gets up to dump it down
the drain.)"
48,Monica," God, what is wrong with me."
49,Ross, You need to get some sleep.
50,Monica, I need to get some Richard.
51,Rachel," Monica, you broke up with him for a reason."
52,Monica," I know, I know. I'm just so tired of-of missing him. I'm tired of
wondering why hasn't he called. Why hasn't he called!"
53,Phoebe," Maybe, because you told him not to."
54,Monica, What are you the memory woman?
55,Joey," (entering) Their not breaking up. Chandler and Janice. Their not breaking
up. He didn't blink or anything."
56,Rachel," Well, you know I'm not surprised. I mean have you seen them together,
they're really cute."
57,Joey, Cute! This is Janice! You remember Janice?
58,Rachel," Yes, Joey, I remember, she's annoying, but you know what she's-she's his
girlfriend now. I mean what can we do?"
59,Joey," There you go! That's the spirit I'm looking for! What can we do? Huh? All
right who's first? Huh? Ross?"
60,Ross," Well I'm thinking that Chandler's our friend and Janice makes him happy,
so I say we just all be adult about it and accept her."
61,Joey," Yeah, we'll call that Plan B. All right?"
63,Rachel," (she leans over and kisses him on the cheek) Honey, I was wondering...."
64,Ross, Hmm?
65,Rachel," Do you still have that, um, Navy uniform?"
66,Ross," Nooo, I had to return it to the costume place."
67,Rachel, Hmm.
68,Ross, I think I have an old band uniform from high school.
69,Rachel," You remember not having sex in high school, right?"
70,Ross, Yeah.
71,Rachel," Well honey, what about you?"
72,Ross, What?
73,Rachel," I mean do you have any fun, you know, fantasy type things?"
74,Ross, No.
75,Rachel, Come on you gotta have one!
76,Ross, Nope.
77,Rachel," Ross, you know what..."
78,Ross, What?
79,Rachel," ...if you tell me, I might do it."
80,Ross," Okay, umm. Did you ever see, um, Return Of The Jedi?"
81,Rachel, Yeah.
82,Ross," Do you remember the scene with, um, Jabba the Hut? Well Jabba had as, as
his prisoner, um, Princess Leia. "
83,Rachel, Oooh!
84,Ross," Princess Leia, was wearing this, um, gold bikini thing. It was pretty
cool."
86,Phoebe," Yeah, oh, Princess Leia and the gold bikini, every guy our age loved
that."
87,Rachel, Really!
88,Phoebe," Um, um. It's huge. Yeah, that's the moment, when-when, you know she
stopped being a princess, and became, like, a woman, you know."
89,Rachel, Did you ever do the-the Leia thing?
90,Phoebe," Oh, yeah, um-mm. Oh!"
91,Rachel, Really! That-that great huh?
92,Phoebe, No it's just that I got this new pager and I have it on vibrate. See ya!
93,Ross, (entering with Monica in tow) Hey!
94,Rachel, Hi you guys!
95,Ross," Look who I found standing outside of the Szechwan Dragon staring at a
parking meter."
96,Rachel, Mon. Hi! 
97,Monica, Hi.
98,Rachel, Why aren't you at work?
99,Monica," Oh, they-they sent me home."
100,Rachel, Why?
101,Monica, Because I don't work at the Szechwan Dragon.
102,Ross, Okay.
103,Rachel," You really, really need to get some sleep, honey."
104,Monica, I know I do.
105,Ross, Hi.
106,Rachel, Hi.
107,Ross, Guess what?
108,Rachel, What?
109,Ross, They published my paper.
110,Rachel," Oh, really, let me see, let me see."
111,Phoebe," Rach, look! (she holds two buns up to her ears to make her hair look
like the Princess Leia 'do.) Oh, hi! Where is my strong Ross Skywalker to come rescue me.
(Ross stands up horrified) There he is."
114,Chandler, Hey!
115,Joey, Wheel!
116,Chandler, Of!
117,Joey, Fortune! This guy is so stupid. (yelling) It's Count Rushmore!!
118,Chandler," You know, you should really go on this show. All right, listen, I got
three tickets to the Rangers tonight. What'd ya' say?"
119,Joey," I say, 'I am there!' Cool! Aw, is Ross going to?"
120,Chandler," No, Janice."
121,Joey," Jan-ice. 'Cause I, just, I feel bad for Ross, you know, we-we always go
together, we're like the three hocke-teers."
122,Chandler," You know, I may be way out on a limb here, but do you, do you, have a
problem with Janice?"
123,Joey," No, Yeeees. God, how do I say this. (walks into the kitchen, Chandler
follows closely, he turns around and gets startled). Oh, hi, you know that girl from the
Greek restaurant with the hair (holds his hands up to signify she has big hair)?"
124,Chandler," Ooh, that girl that I hate, eww, drives me crazy, eww, eww, oh!"
125,Joey," Look, I don't hate Janice, she's-she's just a lot to take, you know."
126,Chandler," Well, there you go."
127,Joey," Oh, hey. Come on man, don't look at me like that, she used to drive you
nuts before too, remember?"
128,Chandler," Well, I'm crazy about her now. I think this could be the real thing.
Capital 'R'! Capital 'T'! (Joey stares at him) Don't worry, those are the right letters."
129,Joey," Look, what do you want me to say?"
130,Chandler, I want you to say that you like her!
131,Joey," I can't. It's like this chemical thing, you know. Every time she starts
laughing, I just wanna (grimaces and tenses up) pull my arm off just so that I can have
something to throw at her. "
132,Chandler," Thanks for trying. (grabs the ticket and starts to leave) Oh, and by
the way there is no Count Rushmore!"
133,Joey," Yeah, then-then who's the guy that painted the faces on the mountain?
(Chandler gives him a look like 'You stupid idiot!')"
136,Ross, How could you have told her? 
137,Rachel," Ross, I didn't think it would that big of a deal."
138,Ross," Oh, she didn't think it would be that big of deal."
139,Rachel," Okay, who are you talking to when you do that?"
140,Ross," Look, that was supposed to be like a private, personal thing between us."
141,Rachel," Okay, Ross, Phoebe is my girlfriend, okay, we tell each other
everything. You know, I mean, come on, guys do the same thing, I mean, what about all that
locker room stuff."
142,Ross," That's different, okay. That's like, uh 'Who dated a stripper?' or 'Who
did it on the back of the Staton Island Ferry?'."
143,Rachel, Were both of those Joey?
144,Ross," Yeah. Look, you don't, you don't talk about like, you know, your
girlfriend and the intimate stuff you, you do with her."
145,Rachel, Not even with your best friend.
146,Ross, Noo!
147,Rachel," That is so sad. Your missing out on so much, Ross. I mean, the bonding
and the sharing, you know. And-and knowing that someone else is going through the same
thing you are."
148,Ross," Hmph. So what you, you tell each other everything?"
149,Rachel, Pretty much.
150,Ross," Did you talk about the night of five times? Do you tell people about the
night of five times? "
151,Rachel," Uh, honey, yeah that was with Carol."
152,Ross," I know, but it's still worth mentioning, I think."
154,Phoebe," ( in a soothing voice) Relax every muscle in your body. Listen to the
plinky-plunky music. Okay, now close you eyes, and think of a happy place. Okay, tell me
your happy place."
155,Monica," Richard's living room, drinking wine."
156,Phoebe," All right. No, no, no, not a Richard thing, just put down the glass. And
get out!"
157,Monica," I'm sorry, but that's my happy place."
158,Phoebe," Well, okay, fine, use my happy place. Okay, I'm just gonna, I have to
ask that you don't move anything."
159,Monica," All right, I'll try not to."
160,Phoebe," Okay, all right, so, your in a meadow, millions of stars in the sky...."
161,Monica, Do you think breaking up with him was a huge mistake?
162,Phoebe," All right, there are no questions in the happy place. Okay, just, the
warm breeze, and the moonlight flowing through the trees...."
163,Monica," I'll bet he's totally over me, I'll bet he's fine."
164,Phoebe," All right, betting and wagering of any kind, are, I'm sure, not
permitted in the happy place. Okay. Just-just, you know, the-the lovely waterfalls, and
the, the trickling fountains. And the-the calming sounds of the babbling brook...."
165,Monica," Okay, this isn't working. I'm still awake and now I have to pee."
168,Joey," I, ah, I never said hate, I was very careful about that."
170,Joey, And you got a 'hate' from that?! Your taking a big leap there...
172,Joey, But what does that gonna do...
174,Joey, Okay. I'm in.
176,Joey, Does it have to be a whole day?
178,Joey," Yeah, I know, I sleep in the next room."
180,Monica," (crying) So, I went down to the post office, and it turns out it was
those videos that I ordered for Richard about the Civil War. He loved the Civil War."
181,Phoebe," Monica, do you want us to take you home?"
182,Monica," Uh, huh. (to Ross) Or maybe to a galaxy far, far away. (Rachel, Monica,
and Phoebe leave)"
183,Ross, Women tell each other everything. Did you know that?
184,Chandler," Umm, yeah."
185,Ross," No Chandler, everything! Like stuff you like, stuff she likes, technique,
stamina, girth...."
186,Chandler," Girth? Why, why, why, wh-why, why, why, why would they do this? "
187,Ross," Rachel says sharing's great and supposedly, you know, we outta be doing
it. Do you wanna?"
188,Chandler, We're not gonna talk about girth are we?
189,Ross, Nooo!
190,Chandler," Yeah, okay."
191,Ross, Yeah?
192,Chandler, Yeah! All right! You go first.
193,Ross," Okay, okay, I'll go first."
194,Chandler, Okay.
195,Ross," So, uh, the other night Rachel and I are in bed talking about fantasies,
and I happened to describe a particular Star Wars thing...."
196,Chandler, Princess Leia in the gold bikini.
197,Ross, Yes! 
198,Chandler, I know!
199,Ross," Yes! Wow, well, that-that was easy. Okay, you-you go."
200,Chandler, Okay.
201,Ross, Okay.
202,Chandler," Okay, you know, you know when your in bed, with a woman."
203,Ross, Hmph.
204,Chandler," And, ah, you know, your fooling around with her. And you get all these
like, mental images in your brain, you know, like Elle MacPherson, or that girl at the
Xerox place...."
205,Ross," With the belly-button ring? Oh, muhawa!"
206,Chandler," I know, And then all of the sudden your Mom pops into your head. And
your like 'Mom, get outta here!' You know, but of course, like, after that you can't
possibly think of anything else, and you can't, you know, stop what your doing. So it's
kinda like, you're, you know. You know...(Ross just stares at him). You don't know!"
207,Ross," Your Mom, your telling me, your telling me, about your Mom, what is the
matter with you?"
208,Chandler, You said...
209,Ross," I said 'share' not 'scare'. Go sit over there! (Chandler
goes over and sits at a table and puts his head down)."
212,Joey, Hey!
213,Chandler, What are you guys doing together?
215,Chandler, Really.
216,Joey," Yeah, yeah. We went to a Mets game, we got Chinese food, and you know, I
love this woman. You have got competition buddy."
218,Chandler, You still can't stand her can you?
219,Joey," I'm sorry man, I tired, I really did."
220,Chandler," Well, you know, I appreciate you giving it a shot."
221,Joey," But, hey, look, you know the good thing is, is that we spent the whole day
together and I survived, and what's even more amazing, so did she. It was bat day at Shea
Stadium."
222,Chandler," Well, I guess that's something."
223,Joey," No man, that's huge! Now, I know I can stand to be around her, which means
I get to hang out with you, which is kinda the whole point, anyway."
224,Chandler, Okay.
225,Joey," Oh, hey, Chandler, we, ah, we stopped by the coffee shop and ran into
Ross."
226,Chandler, Oh God!
227,Joey," Hey, if it makes you feel any better, I do it too."
228,Chandler, Really?
229,Joey," Oh yeah, I always picture your Mom when I'm having sex."
233,Monica," Hi, Dad, what are you doing here?"
235,Monica," I don't, I just, I just like the smell of them. So, uh, what are you
really doing here Dad?"
237,Monica, What makes you think that I might not be okay?
239,Monica, Oh.
241,Monica," I'm fine, just a little tired, I'm okay. How's Richard doing?"
243,Monica," No, I really, really do."
245,Monica, Really!
247,Monica, You're not just saying that are you?
249,Monica, Was he crying?
251,Monica," Well, do you think he was waiting 'til after you left, so he could cry?"
253,Monica, I think so.
257,Rachel," Okay, here we go. I'm Jabba's prisoner, and you have a really weird look
on your face. What? Honey, what is it? Did I get it wrong? Did I get the hair wrong? What?
Did you just picture it differently? What? What?"
258,Ross," No, no it's, um, it's not you, um, it's um, it's (turns and sees his Mom
standing where Rachel is)"
260,Ross," I hate Chandler, the bastard ruined my life. (Rachel starts looking around
and down, with a 'What the hell is going on?' look on her face.)"

0,Joey, (from bedroom) WHOAA!!
1,Chandler," (going to the bedroom) See Joe, that's why your parents told you not
to jump on the bed."
4,Monica," Hey, look at me. I'm making jam, been at it since 4 o'clock this
morning."
5,Ross, Where'd you get fruit at four in the morning?
6,Monica, Went down to the docks. Bet ya didn't know you could get it wholesale.
7,Rachel, I didn't know there were docks.
9,Joey, Hey.
10,Chandler, Hey.
11,Ross," Aww, is it broken?"
12,Joey," No, I gotta wear this thing for a couple weeks. (points to the sling he is
wearing)"
13,Rachel, Did you tell the doctor you did it jumping up and down on your bed?
14,Joey, Nooo. I had a story all worked out but then Chandler sold me out.
15,Chandler," Well, I'm sorry Joe. I didn't think the doctor was gonna buy that it
just *fell* out of the socket."
16,Joey, What is this? Fruit?
17,Rachel, Monica's making jam.
18,Joey," Whoa, jam! I love jam! (to Chandler) Hey, how come we never have jam at
our place?"
19,Chandler, Because the kids need new shoes.
20,Monica," I'm going into business people. I'm sick and tired of being depressed
about Richard. I needed a plan, a plan to get over my man. What's the opposite of man?
Jam. (sees Joey trying some jam from the pot) Oh Joey don't! It's way to hot. (Joey
realizes this and spits what he had in his mouth back into the pot.)"
21,Joey, This will just be my batch.
23,Phoebe," (turns around) Um, that's it. No. Hey! You! J. Crew guy. Yeah. Why have
you been following me? I mean, all week long everywhere I look there's you."
25,Phoebe, What?
27,Phoebe," Oooh. Oh, well this is awkward. "
29,Phoebe," Um, yeah, you want Ursula, and I'm Phoebe. Twin sisters! Seriously."
31,Phoebe," Oh, you're not a dingus."
33,Phoebe," Well, I mean look it's, it's not your fault, you know. I mean this is
just what, what she does to guys, okay."
35,Phoebe," Wait, (grabs him) you know what, I got a little story. When I was in
Junior High School I went through this period where I thought I was a witch. And there was
this guidance counselor who said something to me, that I think will help you a lot. He
said okay, 'you're not a witch you're just an average student.' See what I'm saying?"
37,Phoebe," Um, well, get over it. So, I mean you, you just seem to be a really nice
guy, you know. Don't be so hard on yourself okay."
39,Phoebe," Oh, thanks a lot. Do you want to get a cup of coffee?"
41,Phoebe," Okay. (they start to leave, he is still following her) Okay, you don't
have to walk behind me any more."
44,Rachel, Mon?
45,Ross, Mon?
46,Rachel, (reading) 'Gone for more jars. Back later. Monica Geller.'
47,Ross," Wait a minute, look."
48,Rachel, What?
49,Ross," Look, look, look."
50,Rachel," What, what, what?"
51,Ross, It's an empty apartment.
52,Rachel, Oooh.
53,Ross, We're all alone in an empty apartment.
54,Rachel," Honey, come on, I have to be at work in like ten minutes (Ross starts
kissing her neck) Oh, all right, well it's not like I'm employee of the year or anything.
(they fall onto the couch)"
56,Ross, There it is.
57,Rachel," Oh, oh, that's what you're talking about. (to Chandler) Hey."
58,Ross, Hey.
59,Chandler, Do I look fat?
61,Chandler," Okay, I accept that. When Janice asked me and I said no, she took that
to mean that I was calling her a cow. "
62,Rachel," Okay, walk us through it, honey, walk us through it."
63,Chandler," Okay, well. Janice said 'Hi, do I look fat today?' And I, I looked at
her...."
64,Ross," Whoa, whoa, whoa. You looked at her. You never look. You just answer, it's
just a reflex. Do I look fat? Nooo! Is she prettier than I am? Noo! Does size matter?"
65,Rachel, Nooo!
66,Ross, And it works both ways.
67,Chandler," Okay, so you both just know this stuff?"
68,Rachel," Well you know, after about thirty or forty fights, you kinda catch on."
69,Ross," Okay, for instance. Let's say, Janice is coming back from a trip and she
gives you two options. Option number 1 she'll take a cab home from the airport. Option 2
is you can meet her at baggage claim. Which do you do?"
70,Chandler," That's easy, baggage claim."
71,Ross," (buzzes) Wrong! Now you're single. It's actually secret option number
three, you meet her at the gate. That way she knows you love her."
72,Chandler," Okay, this is good, this is good. All right listen, I have one. Janice
likes to cuddle, at night, which, you know I'm all for. But, uh, you know when you want to
go to sleep, you want some space. So, uh, how do I tell her that without, you know,
accidentally calling her fat or something."
73,Rachel," Oh honey, I'm sorry we can't help you there, 'cause we're cuddlily
sleepers. (Chandler makes an 'Ewww' face) Okay, I'm late for work."
74,Ross, Oh.
75,Rachel, All right are you guys gonna come down?
76,Ross," Uh, yeah, yeah I'll, I'm right behind you."
77,Rachel, Good luck Chandler.
78,Chandler, Thank you Rachel.
79,Ross, Bye sweetie.
80,Rachel, Bye hon.
81,Ross," (blows her a kiss) Okay the sleeping thing. Very tricky business, but
there is something you can do."
82,Chandler," Well, I thought you guys were cuddlily sleepers."
83,Ross," Noo! No, not cuddlily, not me, just her. I'm like you, I need the room.
Okay, come here. (they sit on the couch and Ross puts his hands on Chandler's shoulder and
thigh.) Okay, you're in bed..."
84,Chandler, Yeah. (they both notice where his hands are)
85,Ross, I'm gonna use the cushion.
86,Chandler, Yeah.
87,Ross," Okay, you're in bed. She's over on your side, cuddling. Now you wait for
her to drift off, and then you hug her (demonstrates on the cushion) and roll her back
over to her side of the bed. And then you rollll a-way. Hug for her! Roll for you."
88,Chandler," Okay, the old hug and roll."
89,Ross, Yep.
90,Chandler," Okay, one question."
91,Ross, Shoot.
92,Chandler, You're pretending the pillow's a girl right?
94,Joey," Remember when you where a kid and your Mom would drop you off at the
movies with a jar of jam and a little spoon?"
95,Rachel, (Looks at him) You're so pretty.
96,Phoebe, (entering) Hi!
98,Phoebe," Hey, oh, you know that guy who's been following me? I talked to him
today."
99,Joey, (with food in his mouth) You talked to him. Are you crazy?
100,Phoebe," Okay, first I'm not crazy. And second, say it don't spray it. Anyway his
name is Malcom, and he wasn't following me, I mean he was, but 'cause he thought I was
Ursula, ick. And, that's why, that's why he couldn't just come up and talk to me. 'Cause
of the restraining order."
101,Chandler," Umm, not feeling better 'bout Malcom."
102,Phoebe," Ooh! No, no, no, no, he's not like a kook, no. He's just like this, this
very passionate, incredibly romantic guy, that got like a tinsy bit carried away, you
know. And we just get along really well, and he's so cute."
103,Ross," Oh my God, you've got a crush on your sister's stalker."
104,Phoebe," No, I'm just gonna help him, you know, get 'de-Ursula-ized', like you
know, like I did for Joey after he went out with her."
105,Joey," (with his mouthful) Hey, I didn't stalk her. I mean (he sprays Phoebe with
crumbs) "
106,Phoebe," Okay, I asked for the news, not the weather."
107,Monica, (entering) Hey guys.
109,Monica," Joey, this is for you. (gives him a jar of jam) It's blackberry curin."
110,Joey, Aww. (tastes it) Ohh!
111,Chandler," Hey, Joe, I gotta ask. The girl from the Xerox place buck naked (holds
up one hand), or, or a big tub of jam. (holds up the other hand)"
112,Joey, Put your hands together.
113,Monica," Joey, take your time with that. That's my last batch."
114,Joey, No more jam?!
115,Rachel," Well, what happened to your jam plan?"
116,Monica," I figured out I need to charge seventeen bucks a jar just to break even.
So, I've got a new plan now. Babies."
117,Chandler," Well, your gonna need much bigger jars."
118,Ross, What are you talking about?
119,Monica, I'm talking about me having a baby.
120,Ross, What?
121,Rachel, Are you serious?
122,Monica," Yeah. The great thing about the jam plan was, I was taking control of my
life. So I asked myself, what is the most important thing to me in the world and that's
when I came up with the baby plan. "
123,Ross," Well, aren't you forgetin' something? What, what, what is uh, what is that
guy's name? Dad!"
124,Monica," It took me 28 years to find one man that I wanna spend my life with, if
I have to wait another 28 years then, I'll be 56 before I can have a baby, and that's just
stupid."
125,Chandler," That, that's what's stupid."
126,Monica," I don't need an actual man, just a couple of his best swimmers. And
there, there are places you can go to get that stuff."
127,Rachel, Down at the docks again?
130,Chandler," Night-night.....Janice. (he starts thinking to him self) 'Look at
all that room on her side, you good fit a giant penguin over there. That would be weird
though. Okay, hug and roll time. I'm huggin', I'm huggin', your rollin', and....yes!
Freedom! (his one arm is still under her) Except for this arm! I'm stuck. Stuck arm! Okay,
time for the old table cloth trick, one fluid motion. Quick like a cat, quick like a cat!
And 1...2...3!' (Pulls his arm out from under her and she is spun off of the bed.)"
134,Phoebe," Oh, great. Great. You're doing great, you know real strong. Going
strong. Keep going."
136,Phoebe," Oh, yeah. What's this? (picks up a book)"
138,Phoebe," Um, not even a little bit."
140,Phoebe," Oh, okay then."
142,Phoebe, Good. So what were you thinking?
144,Phoebe, Really?
146,Phoebe, Oh.
148,Phoebe," Oh, okay. (he kisses her)"
150,Chandler," No, that's all right. I just had a jar of mustard."
151,Monica," (entering from her bedroom) Okay, sperm donor number 03815, come on
down! Okay, he's 6'2"", 170 pounds, and he describes himself as a male Geena Davis."
152,Chandler, You mean there's more than one of us.
153,Ross," Look, you can't do this Mon. All right, if you do this, I'm, I'm gonna,
I'm, I'm gonna....."
154,Monica, You're gonna what?
155,Ross, I'm gonna tell Mom.
156,Rachel," Honey, I'm sorry, but he's right. I love you, but you're crazy."
157,Ross, Crazy.
158,Monica," What?! Why? Why is this crazy? So this isn't the ideal way to
something...."
159,Ross," (interrupting her) Oh, it's not the ideal way..."
160,Monica," Lips moving, still talking. I mean it may not be ideal, but I'm so
ready. No, I-I-I see the way Ben looks at you. It makes me ache, you know?"
161,Joey, Check it out!! Jam crackers!
162,Monica," Okay, all right, how's this? 27. Italian-American guy. He's an actor,
born in Queens. Wow, big family, seven sisters, and he's the only....boy. (they all turn
and look at Joey) Oh my God, under personal comments 'New York Knicks, rule!'"
163,Joey," Yeah, the Knicks rule!"
164,Monica," Joey, this is you!"
165,Joey," Let me see. (goes over and looks at the form) Oh, right."
166,Rachel, When did you go to a sperm bank?
167,Joey," Well, right after I did that sex study down at NYU. (to Chandler) Hey,
Remember that sweater I gave you for your birthday?"
168,Chandler, And that's how you bought it?
169,Joey," Noooo, that's what I was wearing when I donated. I'm kinda surprised
there's any of my boys left."
170,Monica," Well, honey, it is pretty competitive. I mean I've got an actual rocket
scientist here."
171,Joey," Maybe, I should call this place and get them to put my 'Days of Our Lives'
on here. You know, juice this puppy up a little."
172,Phoebe, (entering) Hellooo!
174,Ross, How's the maniac?
175,Phoebe," Oh, well he's yummy. We did a little kissin'."
176,Rachel," Phoebe, what are you doing?"
177,Phoebe," Oh, no, no, no, no. You know what, he's not into that stuff anymore. He
quit for me."
178,Rachel," Pheebs, this guy has been obsessed with your sister, for God knows how
long, okay, you don't just give up something like that."
179,Phoebe," Look, he gave me his night vision goggles and everything."
180,Ross, You're taking the word of a guy who has night vision goggles?
181,Phoebe," What, he's not still following her. Do you think he is still following
her?"
182,Chandler," Pheebs, wake up and smell the restraining order."
183,Phoebe, What are you saying I should do?
184,Monica," I think, that if you really like this guy, you should just trust him."
185,Phoebe," Thank you, Monica."
186,Joey," Orrr, you could follow him and see where he goes."
187,Monica," Oh, that's what I would do, forget mine."
189,Rachel," Oh my God, what happened? (points to the cast on Janice's wrist)"
191,Rachel, Wow! Spinning that sounds like fun.
193,Rachel," (turns around, not amused) Ross's what?"
197,Phoebe, Yes? Yes! Oh.
199,Phoebe," Oh, I was just here looking for, um, my um, my part of an old sandwich.
Oh, here it is! Oh. (picks one up out of the garbage can.)"
201,Phoebe," Um, perhaps. Yes! Yes, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I was just afraid that you
were still hung up on my sister."
203,Phoebe," Oh well, what do you know, there goes my identical twin sister. Just
walkin' along looking like me. What, is this just like a freakish coincidence, or did you
know she takes this train?"
205,Phoebe," No, no, it's not your fault. You know it's partly my fault, 'cause I
made you quit cold turkey. Sorry, no. Okay, well, I mean, I can't date you anymore, 'cause
your, you know (in a high pitched voice) Wow! But um, but I will definitely, definitely
help you get over my sister. Okay, stalk me for a while. Huh? Yeah, and, and, and, I'll be
like an Ursula patch."
207,Phoebe," Yeah, just, okay, look I'm going. Um, come on. Op, op, behind the
pillar, which way am I gonna go? "
209,Joey, Hey.
210,Monica, Hey.
211,Joey, Where you going?
212,Monica, To the bank.
213,Joey, Sperm or regular?
214,Monica, Sperm.
215,Joey," So you're really doing this, huh?"
216,Monica," Oh yeah, picked a guy, 37135. "
217,Joey, Sounds nice.
218,Monica," 'Fraid so. Brown hair, green eyes..."
219,Joey," No kiddin', hmm. "
220,Monica, What?
221,Joey," No, I-I figured you would've picked a blond guy."
222,Monica, Really? Why?
223,Joey," I don't know, I just always pictured you ending up with one of those tall,
smart blond guys, name like.... Hoyt."
224,Monica, Hoyt?
225,Joey," It's a name, yeah. I saw you, you know, in this great house with a big
pool."
226,Monica," Really, is he a swimmer?"
227,Joey, He's got the body for it.
228,Monica, I like that. (Joey starts laughing) What?
229,Joey," You guys have one of those signs that says 'We don't swim in your toilet,
so don't pee in our pool.', you know."
230,Monica, We do not have one of those signs.
231,Joey," Sure you do, it was a gift from me. Oh! And you have these three great
kids."
232,Monica, Two girls and a boy?
233,Joey, Yeah!
234,Monica," And, and, and they wear those little water wings, you know. And they're,
they're running around on the deck. Then Hoyt wraps this big towel around all three of
them."
235,Joey," Sure! (Monica gets very depressed) But hey, you know this way sounds good
too. "
236,Monica, Yeah.
237,Joey," Oh Monica. (goes over and hugs her, then looks at the form and stops
hugging her.) Wow, this guy's an astronaut. That would've been cool, (sees Monica) for
like a day. (hugs her again)."
240,Joey," I called the sperm bank today, they haven't sold a single unit of
Tribianni. Nobody wants my product. I mean, I-I-I don't get it (tries to drink the rest of
the jam out of the jar and gets it all over his face, on his chin, nose, etc.) Maybe if
they met me in person."
241,Rachel," Honey, you got a little thing on your...(points to her whole face)"
242,Joey, (wipes a little jam from the corner of his mouth) Did I get it?
243,Rachel, Yeah.
244,Ross, (entering) Hello. 
245,Rachel, Hello.
246,Ross," (sees Joey) Hey. (walks into the living room) Uh, Chan, can I uh, can I
talk to you for a second?"
247,Chandler, Sure. What's up?
248,Ross," Just one uh, one additional relationship thought. Probably something your
already familiar with, uh, women talk! (smacks Chandler over the head with a magazine)"
2,Joey," You guys, can we please not watch this all right."
5,Joey," (on tv) Oh, you said it Mike. (rips open the carton and spills milk on the
counter) Aw! There's got to be a better way!"
8,Rachel," Noo way, Kevin."
11,Chandler, You're flingin'-flangin' right I am!
13,Joey," (on TV, finishing installing the Milk Master 2000) Wow, it is easy.
(starts to poor the milk) Now, I can have milk everyday."
17,Chandler," Well, it's official there are no good movies."
19,Monica," Perhaps, you would like me to turn like this, (turns sideways on the
couch) so that you can bunny bump against my back."
20,Joey, (entering) Hey!
21,Phoebe, Hey.
22,Chandler," Hey, man. What's up?"
23,Joey," Maybe you can tell me. My agent would like to know why I didn't show up at
the audition I didn't know I had today. The first good thing she gets me in weeks. How
could you not give me the message?!"
24,Chandler," Well, I'll tell ya I do enjoy guilt, but, ah, it wasn't me."
25,Phoebe," Yes, it was! It was him! Uh huh! (they all stare at her) Okay, it was
me! "
26,Joey, How is it you?
27,Phoebe," Well, it was just, it was all so crazy, you know. I mean, Chandler was
in the closet, counting to 10, and he was up to 7 and I hadn't found a place to hide yet.
I-I-I meant to tell you, and I wrote it all down on my hand. See, all of it. (shows him
her hand)"
28,Joey," Yep, that's my audition."
29,Monica," See, now this is why I keep notepads everywhere."
30,Phoebe," Yep, and that's why we don't invite you to play."
32,Joey," Well, Estelle tried, you know. The casting director told her that I missed
my chance."
33,Phoebe, That is unfair. I'll call her and tell her it was totally my fault.
34,Joey," Pheebs, you can't do that. The casting director doesn't talk to friends,
she only talks to agents."
35,Phoebe," What a sad little life she must lead. Okay, ooh (starts dialing). "
36,Joey," What, what are you doing? What are you doing?"
37,Phoebe," No, no, no, I know, I know, ooh. (on the phone in a different voice)
'Hi, this is Katelynn, from Phoebe Buffay's office. Um, is um, Ann there for Phoebe,
she'll know what it's about.'"
38,Joey," Hang up, hang up. (reaches with his good arm, but Phoebe grabs it and he
tries to reach the phone with his other arm but can't because of the sling.)"
39,Phoebe," (on phone) 'Annie! Hi. Listen we got a problem with Joey Tribbiani,
apparently he missed his audition. Who did you speak to in my office? Estelle, no, I don't
know what I'm going to do with her. No. All right, so your husband leaves and burns down
the apartment, the world does not stop.'"
40,Chandler, Is anybody else scared?
41,Phoebe," (on phone) 'Right, well look, um, if Joey loses this audition, that is
it for Estelle. I don't care! Annie you are a doll, what time can you see him?' (to
Monica) I need a pen. (Chandler hands her one, but she needs something to right on, so she
tilts Chandler's head over and writes on the back of his neck)"
42,Chandler, Get the woman a pad! Get the woman a pad! A pad! A pad!
43,Monica," Oh, now you want a pad."
46,Ross," There's my boy! Here's my boy! And here's his Barbi (Ben is holding a
Barbi doll) What's ah, what's my boy doing with a Barbi?"
49,Ross," Yeah, it's, it's, it's cute. Why, why, why does he have it, again?"
52,Ross," You know what it's fine. If you're okay with the Barbi thing, so
am I."
54,Ross," Give daddy the Barbi! Ben, give, give me the Barbi.
Okay, how 'bout, don't you want to play with the monster truck? (makes a monster truck
sound) No. Okay, oh, oh, how about a Dino-soilder? (squawks like a dinosaur)"
55,Rachel," Ross, you are so pathetic. Why can't your son just play with his doll?
(uses the Milk Master 2000 to pour milk into her cereal)"
56,Monica," (entering from her bedroom) I gotta go to work. Has anybody seen my left
boob?"
57,Joey, I love that movie. (Joey is using it as a pillow)
58,Monica," There it is. Joey, what are you doing?"
59,Joey," I'm sorry, it just felt nice."
60,Chandler, (entering with his ringing phone) Joe. Joe! Answer the phone.
61,Joey," Hey, I only got one good arm, you know. You should be doing stuff for me.
Go get me a sweater."
62,Chandler," Just do it! Okay, it's Janice and if I get it I'm going to have to see
her tonight. (phone stops ringing) Oh, that's great I'm gonna have to see her tonight."
63,Rachel, What's the big deal? Why don't you wanna see Janice?
64,Chandler," Okay, last night at dinner, when the meals came, she put half her
chicken piccata on my plate and took my tomatoes."
65,Ross," And that's bad because..., you hate chicken piccata?"
66,Chandler, Noo.
67,Ross," You didn't want to share your tomatoes, tomatoes are very important to
you."
68,Chandler," No, it's like all of the sudden, we were this couple. And this alarm
started going off in my head 'Run for your life! Get out of the building!'"
69,Rachel, Men are unbelievable.
70,Monica," What is it with you people! I mean, the minute you start to feel
something, you have to run away?"
71,Chandler," I know, that, (looks at her fake chest, and loses his train of
thought, temporarily) that's why I don't want to go tonight, I'm afraid I'm going to say
something stupid."
72,Monica," Oh, you mean like that guy thing where you act mean and distant until
you get us to break up with you."
73,Joey," Hey, you know about that?!"
74,Chandler," Look what do I do? I wanna get past this, I don't wanna be afraid of
the commitment thing. I wanna go through the tunnel, to the other side! "
76,Ross, (to Joey) Where there is no fear of commitment.
77,Chandler," Do we have any...(turns around and bumps Monica's fake chest) Do we
have any thoughts here?"
78,Joey," Well, I've never been through the tunnel myself, 'cause as I understand
it, you're not allowed to go through with more than one girl in the car, right. But, it
seems to me it's pretty much like anything else, you know, face your fear. It have a fear
of heights, you go to the top of the building! If you're afraid of bugs.....get a bug.
Right. In this case, you have a fear of commitment, so I say you go in there and be the
most committed guy there ever was."
79,Rachel," Amazingly, that makes sense."
80,Chandler, You think?
81,Joey," Oh, yeah. Go for it man, jump off the high dive, stare down the barrel of
the gun, pee into the wind!"
82,Chandler," Yeah, Joe, I assure you if I'm staring down the barrel of a gun, I'm
pretty much peeing every which way."
84,Phoebe," Oh, it's your audition from this morning. Can I use the phone again?"
85,Rachel," Sure Pheebs, you know, that's what it's there for, emergencies and
pretend agents."
86,Joey," Come on baby, come on!"
87,Phoebe," (on phone, in 'Katelynn's' voice) 'Hi, I have Phoebe Buffay returning a
page. Okay, well, um, she's in her car I'll have to patch you through.'"
88,Rachel, Very nice touch.
89,Phoebe," (in voice, on phone) 'Okay, go ahead.' (in normal voice on phone) Um, hi
Annie. (listens) Fantastic! (to Joey) You got it. (on phone) Oh, okay, um, 'Will he work
for scale?' you ask me. Well, I don't know about that, (Joey clears his throat to signify
yes) except that I do and he will. Great, oh you are such a sweetheart. I would love to
have lunch with you, how about we have lunch next....(hangs up phone) Op, went through a
tunnel."
90,Rachel, Unbelievable.
91,Joey, Thank you so much.
92,Phoebe," It was really fun, I mean I've never talked on a car phone before."
93,Joey," You were amazing, could you just do me this huge favor, you see there's
this one other audition that I really, really want, and Estelle couldn't get me in."
94,Phoebe," Oh, I don't know. I mean it was fun one time."
95,Joey," Come on, please, it'll be just this one more, well actually it's two."
96,Phoebe, Two?
97,Joey," Yeah! Well, well really it's three. Please. You're so good at it. I love
you."
98,Phoebe," Okay, I'll do it, but just these three, right"
99,Joey," Nooo, four."
102,Chandler," 'Cause, I wanted to uh, give you this. (hands her a present)"
104,Chandler," Well, wait there's, there's more. See the contact paper is to go into
your brand new drawer. (gives her a drawer) See, the drawer actually goes in my dresser."
106,Chandler," Yes, I did. Yes, I did. Because, you're my girlfriend, and that's what
girlfriends should, should get. "
108,Chandler," Well, not me. But that's what's happened, and, ah, and, and there's
more. We should take a trip."
110,Chandler," Yep, we're a couple and that's what couples do. And, I wanna meet your
parents. We should take a trip with your parents!"
112,Chandler," I am, I actually am. I mean this is amazing. My entire life I have
feared this place, and now that I'm here it's like what was the big deal. I could probably
say 'Let's move in together.' and I'd be okay."
114,Chandler, It doesn't scare me!
116,Chandler," Oh, no, no, no, don't go! I've scared ya'! I've said too much! I'm
hopeless, and awkward, and desperate for love!! (Janice leaves, Chandler then calls Janice
to leave a message on her machine) Hey, Janice! It's me. Um, yeah, I-I-I just wanna
apologize in advance for having chased you down the street. (runs out the door)"
119,Rachel," Honey, this will help. (hands him a tub of ice cream)"
120,Chandler," So, I finally catch up to her and she says this relationship is going
to fast and we have to slow down."
122,Monica, That is never good.
123,Chandler, Then I got all needy and clingy.
124,Rachel," Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. Maybe it's not so
bad. How did you leave it?"
125,Chandler, She said she'd call me.
127,Chandler, Oh God.
128,Monica, Welcome to our side of the tunnel.
129,Chandler, This ice cream tastes like crap by the way.
130,Rachel," Yeah, well that's that lo-cal, non dairy, soy milk junk. We sort of, we
save the real stuff for those really terminal cases."
131,Monica," You know, when you start get screwed over all the time, you gotta switch
to low-fat."
132,Rachel," Yeah, you do."
133,Chandler," So, you don't think I'm terminal?"
134,Monica," Well, no, not at all, you're not terminal, you just, you just need some
damage control."
135,Chandler," Okay, okay. So, should I call her?"
137,Rachel," This is a very critical time right now. If you feel yourself reaching
for that phone, then you go shoe shopping, you get your butt in a bubble bath. You want
her back you have to start acting aloof."
138,Monica, She has to know that your not ready.
139,Rachel," Right. So, what you have to do is, you have to accidentally run into her
on purpose. And then act aloof."
140,Chandler," So I'm not, not gonna lose her?"
141,Rachel," Oooh, honey, you're not a total loser."
142,Chandler," I said, 'So I'm not gonna lose her?'"
143,Rachel, Oh.
145,Ross," Guess who's here. It's the toughest guy in toy land, Ben. (singing) 'A
real American hero. I'm G.I. Joe!' Drop the Barbi, drop the Barbi."
146,Rachel, G.I. Joe? Do you really think he's gonna fall for that?
147,Joey, (entering) G. I. Joe! Cool! Can I play?
148,Ross," Look Ben, it's a toy that protects U.S. oil interests overseas!"
150,Phoebe, (entering) Helloo! Oh! (sees Joey and starts to leave)
151,Joey, Pheebs! There you are!
152,Phoebe," No it's not, sorry."
153,Joey," But Phoebe, wait! Wait! Phoebe. Phoebe! (catches her in the hallway)"
154,Phoebe," Oh, Joey! Oh, okay, see I didn't recognize you wearing, in
those....pants."
155,Joey," Look listen, that TV movie I went in for? Did you hear anything? I think I
got a shot at it."
156,Phoebe," Yes! They called and you didn't get it! Okay, I mean you didn't get it,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry."
157,Joey," It's okay, these things happen."
158,Phoebe," But they shouldn't happen, you know what, you're, you're in a terrible,
terrible business. Oh God, I don't wanna be the person who makes your face look like that."
159,Joey," I'm, I'm okay. See. (tries to smile, but fails horribly)"
160,Phoebe," Oh, now you're sad and creepy, oh. You know what, I, I'm sorry I quit,
okay, I just quit."
161,Joey," No! No, no you can't quit! You're the best agent I ever had! Look Pheebs,
rejection is part being an actor, you can't take it personally."
162,Phoebe," Not personal, really, well they said that they never met an Italian
actor with a worse Italian accent."
163,Joey, They actually said that?
164,Phoebe," Yeah. Ooh God, there's that face again! See I can't do this job! I..."
165,Joey," No, no, no, see that's why you have to do this job, agents always lie. You
know, Estelle just says stuff like 'They went another way', but this, I can use this. (in
a very bad Italian accent) I canna work on a new accent."
166,Phoebe," Yeah okay, no if it helps you okay. Yeah."
167,Ross," (running into the hall, in slow motion) You'll never get me, Joe!!! (he
then pretends that he gets shot repeatedly and falls back against Joey and Chandler's
door, dead.)"
170,Chandler," (in a British accent) Hello, Janice."
172,Chandler," (in accent) Oh, just a bit of shopping. How've you been?"
174,Chandler, (normal voice) No. Not anymore.
176,Chandler," Yeah, huh. I'm just uh, you know I'm just picking up some things for a
party. (grabs a bag off of the shelf)"
178,Chandler," Well, I'm sorry if my friends aren't as sophisticated as yours."
180,Chandler, Here in Chelsea.
182,Chandler, A woman's
184,Chandler, (shyly) Chelsea.
186,Chandler, Can I be that guy?
188,Phoebe," Okay, so we got some more good rejections, lots of stuff to work on. "
189,Joey," Okay, shoot."
190,Phoebe," Okay, um, oh, the zoo commercial."
191,Joey, I didn't get it?
192,Phoebe," No. They said you 'Weren't believable as a human being.' So, you can
work on that. "
193,Joey," Okay, what else?"
194,Phoebe," Um, the off-Broadway play people said 'You were pretty but dumb.'"
195,Joey, Oh.
196,Phoebe," Oh no wait, I'm sorry, that's 'pretty dumb.'"
197,Joey," Look, it's okay, no, no, no, really, look um, I really appreciate this
Pheebs, but I think I'm gonna have to go back to Estelle."
198,Phoebe, Oh.
199,Joey," Yeah, well don't get me wrong, you're a better agent than she is, but at
least with her I don't want to blow my pretty dumb brains out."
200,Phoebe," Yeah, no, I understand."
201,Joey," You do, thanks."
202,Phoebe, Yeah. Sorry. (she starts to leave)
203,Joey, Wait a minute.
204,Phoebe, What?
205,Joey," Wait a minute, did you just make up all that stuff just to get out of
being my agent."
206,Phoebe," (in a coy tone) Oh, you caught me. I am so busted."
207,Joey," (in a really, really bad Italian accent) That's-ah what I suspected-ah."
209,Chandler," ....And then I just, you know, threw the bag of barley at her, and ran
out of the store."
210,Monica," My God! Chandler, we said be 'aloof' not 'a doof'."
211,Chandler," I've actually ruined this haven't I? It's time for the good ice cream
now, right?"
212,Rachel," Yeah, it is."
213,Monica," You know what, everything's gonna be okay. "
215,Chandler," (answering phone) Hello. Hi, Janice! Can you hold on for a second?
Okay. (to Monica and Rachel) Okay, what do I do?"
216,Rachel," Shhh...I don't know what to do, this is totally unprecedented."
217,Monica, If-if-if we ever did what you did a man would never call.
218,Rachel, Yeah.
219,Chandler, Hello!
220,Monica," Oh wait, you know what, I got it, I got it, pretend like you just woke
up, okay, that will throw her off. Be sleepy."
221,Rachel," Yes, and grumpy."
222,Chandler," What are you, stop naming dwarves! (on phone) Hello, Janice. Hi, I'm
so glad that you called, I know I've been acting a really weird lately. And, it's just
because I'm crazy about you, and I just got...stupid, and, and scared, and....stupid a
couple of more times. I'm sorry. (listens) Really?! (listens) Really?!"
223,Rachel," He's soo lucky, if Janice were a guy, she'd be sleeping with somebody
else by now."
224,Chandler, (on phone) I love you too.
225,Monica," Aw, it's soo unfair. (they both start digging into the 'good' ice cream)"
228,Ross," Hey, I don't know what to tell you guys that's the doll he chose."
230,Ross," Look, G. I. Joe's in, Barbi's out. And if you guys can't
deal with it, that's your 'too bad.'"
231,Monica," What are you being such a weenie for? So he has a Barbi, big deal. You
used to dress up like a woman."
232,Ross, What?
233,Monica," Well, you used to dress up in Mom's clothes all the time."
234,Ross, What are you talking about?
235,Monica," The big hat, the pearls, the little pick handbag."
236,Ross," Okay, you are totally making this up."
237,Monica, How can you not remember? You made us call you...Bea. 
238,Ross, (remembering) Oh God.
240,Monica, Wasn't there a little song?
242,Ross, There was no song. (to Monica) There was no song!
243,Monica, (singing) 'I am Bea.'
244,Ross, Okay.
245,Monica, 'I drink tea.'
246,Ross," Okay, that's, that's enough. (retreats to the bathroom)"
247,Monica," '....Won't you, won't you, won't you.... '"
248,Ross, (coming out of the bathroom) Won't you dance around with me. 
249,Monica," A-ha!!! (they all start laughing, as Ross hides in the bathroom)"
0,Chandler, (entering) Hey!
1,Joey, Hey!
2,Chandler, Hey-hey-hey. So what happened? A forest tick you off?
3,Joey, No. Y'know how we’re always saying we need a place for the mail.
4,Chandler, Yeah!
5,Joey," Well, I started building one. But then I decided to take it to the next
step."
6,Chandler, You’re building a post office?
7,Joey," No, an entertainment unit, with a mail cubby built right in. It’s a
one day job, max."
8,Chandler," Okay. (notices that Joey is wearing some really tight jeans) My word!
Those are snug."
9,Joey," Oh yeah. These are my old work pants, Sergio Valente’s."
11,Joey, Power saw kinda got away from me there.
14,Rachel, (joining Phoebe outside) Hey Pheebs. 
15,Phoebe, Hey!
16,Rachel, Any sign of your brother?
17,Phoebe," No, but he’s always late."
18,Rachel, I thought you only met him once?
19,Phoebe," Yeah, I did. I think it sounds y'know big sistery, y'know,
‘Frank’s always late.’"
20,Rachel," Well relax, he’ll be here."
21,Phoebe," No, I know, I’m just nervous. Y'know it’s just y'know
Mom’s dead, don’t talk to my sister, Grandma’s been sleeping a lot lately.
It’s like the last desperate chance to have a family, y'know, kinda thing.
You’re so sweet to wait with me."
22,Rachel," Well, actually Gunther sent me. You’re not allowed to have cups out
here, it’s a thing. (takes her cup and goes back inside)"
24,Chandler, Does anyone else think David Copperfield is cute?
25,Monica," No, but he told me, he thinks your a fox."
26,Chandler," All right, Janice, likes him. In fact she likes him so much she put
him on her freebie list."
27,Joey, Her what?
28,Chandler," Well, we have a deal, where we each get to pick five celebrities that
we can sleep with, and the other one can’t get mad."
29,Ross," Ah, the heart of every healthy relationship. Honesty, respect, and sex
with celebrities."
30,Monica," So, Chandler, who’s on your list?"
31,Chandler," Ah, Kim Basinger, Cindy Crawford, Halle Berry, Yasmine Bleeth, and ah,
Jessica Rabbit."
32,Rachel," Now, you do realize that she’s a cartoon, and way out of your
league?"
33,Chandler," I know, I know, I just always wondered if I could get her eyes to pop
out of her head."
34,Joey," Hey, Monica, who would yours be?"
35,Monica," First, I need a boyfriend, then I can have a list."
36,Joey," It’s just a game Mon. (makes a ‘Can-you-believe-her’ face
to the rest of the gang.) Rach, how about you?"
37,Rachel," Oh, I don’t know, I guess, Chris O’Donnel, John F. Kennedy,
Jr., Daniel Day Lewis, Sting, and Parker Stevenson."
38,Ross, Spiderman?
39,Rachel, Hardy Boy.
40,Chandler, Peter Parker.
41,Ross, Thank you.
42,Rachel," What about you honey, who would be on your list?"
43,Ross," Well I-I-I, that kind of thing requires some serious thought. First,
I’ll divide my perspective canidates into catergories...."
44,Chandler, (coughing) What a geek!
45,Phoebe, (entering) Everbody this is Frank! This is my half-brother Frank.
47,Phoebe, This is everybody. This is Ross.
49,Ross, Hey.
50,Phoebe, Chandler.
51,Chandler, Hi.
53,Phoebe, Joey.
54,Joey, Hey-hey!
56,Phoebe, This is Monica.
58,Phoebe, And this is Rachel.
59,Rachel, Hi!
61,Phoebe, I’m gonna get coffee.
63,Chandler," We don’t, really."
64,Rachel," Well, so, now, do you guys have a lot of big plans?"
65,Phoebe," Oh yeah! Yeah, no, we’re gonna connect, y'know bond, and
everything."
67,Chandler," You know, we don’t really take advantage of living in the city."
68,Joey, I know.
70,Joey," Oh, I’m sorry. Did I get ‘ya?"
71,Chandler," No, you didn’t get me!! It’s an electric drill, you get
me, you kill me!!"
72,Joey," Calm down, do you want this unit or not?"
73,Chandler, I do NOT want this unit!!
74,Joey," Well, you should’ve told me that before, I’m not a mind reader.
Hey, we’re out of beer. I’m going to Monica’s."
75,Chandler," Fine! (goes into his room and slams the door, then he slams the bottom
half of the door.)"
77,Monica, Hey! Where ‘ya headin’ in those pants? 1982?
78,Joey," Oh Monica, listen, I ah, I saw down at the hardware store, they got those
designer tiles on sale. If you ever want to redo the bathroom floor."
79,Monica," Why, what’s wrong with my bathroom floor?"
80,Joey," Nothing. It’s just old and dingy, that’s all."
81,Monica, I highly doubt that. (they both go to the bathroom)
82,Joey," Oh yeah. If you ah, move your hamper, you see what color the tile used to
be. (Monica gasps) Yeah."
83,Monica, I can’t live like this! What are we gonna do? What are we gonna do?
84,Joey," Relax. Here hold this (hands her his beer). This old stuff just comes
right off. (he bends down to try and lift some tile right in the middle of the floor, in
his tight pants.)"
85,Monica, That’s a little more than I wanted to see.
86,Joey," (manages to pry off only a small piece) Aw! Look at that, every inch of
this stuff is glued down. It’d take forever to pry this up. You should ah, you should
just leave it. (starts to walk away, but Monica grabs him)"
87,Monica, I can’t leave it! You gouged a hole in my dingy floor.
89,Joey, Eh! There you go.
90,Monica," You know that’s nice, y'know we could put it back there after the
surgeons remove it from your colon!"
92,Phoebe," (sits up) Oh, ew!"
94,Phoebe," Yeah I know what I wanted to ask you. Um, can you roll your tongue?
Because I can, and my Mom couldn’t, and I thought y'know, I figured that was
something I got from our Dad."
96,Phoebe," Yeah, yeah. You can do it to. (tries to do it, but can’t)"
98,Phoebe," Oh right, yeah okay, my Mom could, and I can’t. We don’t have
that...."
100,Phoebe, Feburary 16th.
102,Phoebe," Wow, that’s close. When’s yours?"
104,Phoebe," That’s the same month as Halloween. So, um, what kinda
things do you like to do at home?"
107,Ross," Okay, I’ve got three of my five."
108,Rachel," Three of your five, what?"
109,Ross, Celebrities I’m allowed to sleep with.
110,Rachel, Oh my God! You are giving this a lot of thought.
111,Ross," Yeah, it’s hard okay, I only have two spots left."
112,Chandler," All right, so who do you got it narrowed down to?"
113,Ross," Okay, Elizabeth Hurely...."
114,Chandler," Oooh-hoo, very attractive, forgiving."
115,Ross, Susan Sarandon.
116,Chandler," Eh, y'know what, she’s to political, she probably wouldn’t
let you do it, unless you donated four cans of food first."
117,Ross, And!! Isabella Rosselini.
118,Chandler," Ooh-hoo. Very hot, very sexy. But ah, y'know she’s too
international, y'know she’s never gonna be around."
119,Rachel, So?
120,Chandler," So, you gotta play the odds, pick somebody who’s gonna be in the
country like all the time."
121,Rachel," Yeah, ‘cause that’s why you won’t get Isabella Rosselini,
geography."
123,Phoebe," Okay so, by melting, you meant melting."
125,Phoebe, So is it like art?
127,Phoebe," Um, yeah sure. Why you wanna call your Mom?"
129,Phoebe," Oh, well um, not right now. Y'know I’m just gonna go to bed, I
think the fumes are giving me a headache."
131,Phoebe," G’night, bro."
133,Phoebe," Here. (gives him a fire extinguisher) Y'know, just in case."
137,Monica, What kind of karate is that?
138,Phoebe, No kind. He just makes it up.
139,Monica, So how’s it going with you guys?
140,Phoebe," So far, it kinda blows. I don’t know, I just thought y'know that
he’d feel more like a brother y'know, like you and Ross, just like close and
connected and...."
141,Monica," Oh honey, we’re close now but you-you wouldn’t believe the
years of-of nugies, and wedgies, and flying wedgies, and atomic wedgies, and....(Phoebe
shakes her head like she doesn’t understand) That’s where the waistband actually
goes over your head. "
142,Phoebe, Ah!!
143,Monica," Oh, we used to drive each other crazy playing the shadow game."
144,Phoebe," Oh, how do you play the shadow game?"
145,Monica," Oh, how do you play the shadow game?"
146,Phoebe, I just asked you.
147,Monica, I just asked you.
148,Phoebe, I don’t have time for this.
149,Monica," No, that is what the game is."
150,Phoebe, Which you just gave up really quickly.
151,Chandler, (entering) Have you seen Joey?
152,Monica, What’s the matter?
153,Chandler," Oh, just this! (turns around and has a paint lid stuck to the back of
his pants.) Y’know what it’s my fault really, because the couch is usually where
we keep the varnish."
154,Joey," (yelling from bathroom) Hey, does somebody wanna hand me one of those
tiles."
155,Chandler, What’s going on?
156,Monica, He’s retiling my floor. (they both run to the bathroom)
157,Chandler, Yo!! Spackel boy! Get up!
158,Monica," Ah-ah-ah, now you started this, you will finish it."
159,Chandler, He started mine first!
160,Phoebe," Build the unit Cinderelly, lay the tile Cinderelly."
163,Phoebe," Yeah. (phone rings and Phoebe answers it) ‘Hello. (listens) Oh my
God, I totally forgot! (listens) Well can’t someone else do it. (listens) But, I have
company. (listens) Yeah, no look, that’s all right I’ll come in.’ (hangs up
phone) Um, Frank, I’m really sorry but I have to go to work. It’s-it’s one
of my regulars and he’s insisting that I do ‘um."
165,Phoebe, Oh! I’m a masseuse. I give people massages and stuff.
167,Phoebe," Well, y'know we don’t call it that, but yeah!"
169,Phoebe," All righty. I’ll be back in-in a little bit. Unless you wanna come
with me?"
171,Phoebe," No, no, you can get one yourself. It’ll be on the house! Y'know
what are big sisters for?"
173,Phoebe," No, no, no, I wouldn’t do you myself, I mean that would be weird.
Yeah, no, I’ll get one of the other girls to do it. Oh, this will be so much fun!
Hey! Are you excited?"
176,Monica," It’s beautiful! It’s like the first bathroom floor there ever
was. (Chandler tries to go to the bathroom) Whoa! Are you going in there for?"
177,Chandler," What, like a number?"
178,Ross, (entering) Hey! 
179,Chandler, Hi! Bye! (runs to the bathroom)
180,Ross," Okay, I’m done with my choices, these are final. (holds up a little
card)"
181,Rachel," Well, it’s about time."
182,Joey," Ooh, very official."
183,Ross," Oh, yeah, well y'know Chandler printed it up on his computer."
184,Monica, And who laminated it?
185,Ross, That would be me.
186,Rachel," All right let me see. (grabs the card) Uma Thurman, Winona Ryder,
Elizabeth Hurely, Michelle Pfieffer, and Dorothy Hammel? "
187,Ross," Hey, it’s my list."
188,Rachel," Okay honey, you do realize she only spins like that on ice."
191,Phoebe, Hey!-Hey! What’s going on?
198,Phoebe, You can’t have sex with her!
201,Phoebe," Okay, Jasmine, can you, can you ask Mr. Whiffler if he can wait for like
five minutes."
203,Phoebe," (turns around and hits Frank) So that’s what you thought I did!!
God! That’s not what I do!"
205,Phoebe, Nooo! Why would you think that?
207,Phoebe," Whatever, it’s the perfect end to the perfect weekend anyways."
209,Phoebe, You really thought it was perfect?
211,Phoebe," Yeah, um, which ones in particular were great for you?"
213,Phoebe, I don’t....
215,Phoebe," Right, okay, um-mm."
217,Phoebe," Yeah, I guess I do, yeah."
219,Phoebe," Well, I-I wasn’t hopping mad, y'know."
221,Phoebe," Okay. All right, this is my favourite part of the weekend, right now,
this."
223,Phoebe, Uh-huh.
225,Phoebe, She wasn’t a hooker.
228,Chandler," Okay, on three. One....Two...."
229,Joey, Why don’t we just go on two.
230,Chandler, Why two?
231,Joey, Because it’s faster.
232,Chandler," Yeah, I coulda counted to three like four times without all this
‘two’ talk."
233,Rachel, Oh!
234,Joey," All right, but in the future..."
235,Ross, Okay!! Okay!!
236,Rachel, Come on!
237,Ross," Heavy thing, not getting lighter!"
238,Chandler," Okay, one...two..."
239,Joey, So we are going on two?
241,Chandler," Oh, good job Joe."
242,Joey," Wow, it’s big!"
243,Chandler," Yeah-yeah, so big that it actually makes our doors look smaller! "
244,Joey," Maybe, my ruler’s wrong."
245,Phoebe, Maybe all the rulers are wrong.
246,Joey," Look it’s not that bad. So what, it blocks a little of your door, a
little of my door."
247,Chandler," Yeah, y'know what I got a better idea. How-how ‘bout it blocks
none of mine door and a lot of yours? (throws his shoulder into the center to try and move
it, but it doesn’t move.)"
248,Joey," Yeah, listen, before I forget that side is still wet."
250,Rachel," Okay sir, um-mm, let see if I got this right. Ah, so this is a half-caf,
double tall, easy hazel nut, non-fat, no foam, with whip, extra hot latte, right? (the guy
nods) Okay, great. (she starts to walk away and under her breath) You freak."
252,Ross, (to Gunther) Thank you.
255,Ross, Isabella Rosselini. (points to her)
256,Monica, Are you serious? (they all look) Oh my God.
257,Ross, Damn! I can’t believe I took her off my list.
258,Monica, Why? ‘Cause otherwise you’d go for it?
259,Ross," Yeah, maybe."
260,Rachel," Oh-oh, you lie."
261,Ross, What you don’t think I’d go up to her?
262,Rachel," Ross, it took you ten years to finally admit you liked me."
263,Ross," Yeah, well missy, you better be glad that list is laminated."
264,Rachel," You know what honey, you go ahead, we’ll call her an alternate."
265,Ross," Okay, hold my crawler."
266,Rachel, Okay.
267,Monica," Rach, are you really gonna let him do this?"
268,Rachel," Honey, he’s about to go hit on Isabella Rosselini. I’m just
sorry we don’t got popcorn."
269,Ross," (to Isabella) Hi! Hi, I’m Ross, you don’t know me, but I’m
a big, big fan of yours. I mean, Blue Velvet, woo-oo hoo! Um, I was wondering if I
could um, maybe buy you a cup of coffee? (Gunther hands her change) Or maybe reimburse you
for that one? "
271,Ross," Well, yeah, kinda. Um, but that’s okay, see we have an understanding,
um, see we each have this list of five famous people, (gets his out) so I’m allowed
to sleep with you. No, no, no, it’s flattery."
273,Ross," Oh no, no, no, wait, wait, Isabella. Don’t, don’t just dismiss
this so fast. I mean this is a once in a lifetime opportunity..."
275,Ross," Um, yeah."
277,Ross," Um, no."
279,Ross," But, okay."
281,Ross," Um, see, but that’s not the final draft."
283,Ross," Yeah, um, okay see, you were, you were on the list but my friend, Chandler
(Chandler waves) brought up the very good point that you are international, so I bumped
you for Wynona Rider, local."
285,Ross, What?
287,Ross, (to the rest of the gang) We’re just gonna be friends.
290,Joey, Y'know what?
291,Chandler, Umm?
292,Joey, I bet ‘ya ya I could fit in there. (points to a hole in the center)
293,Chandler, I’ve got five bucks says you can’t.
294,Joey," Get out your checkbook, mister."
295,Chandler," Oh, I think I have the cash."
297,Joey, You are dogged man! I totally fit!
298,Chandler," Yeah, you got me. (picks up a 2x4 and puts it through the handles so
that the doors won’t open) I’m out five big ones! (puts the money in the crack
between the door and frame) Here you go."
299,Joey," Thank you. Cha-ching! (Chandler starts to leave) Oh, well hello Mr.
Lincoln. Better luck next time buddy. (Chandler leaves and closes the door) And the drinks
are on me!"
2,Phoebe," Wow, it’s like a dirty math problem."
3,Ross, I’m sorry the answer there would be...none of us.
5,Joey," Well, that’s really a different question."
7,Joey," Well, there was that one time that Monica and Rachel got together."
9,Rachel," Excuse me, there was no time!"
10,Joey," Okay, but let’s say there was. How might that go?"
12,Rachel, Does anybody need more coffee?
13,Ross," Yeah, I’ll take some."
14,Joey," Hey, there’s a dog out there!"
17,Phoebe," Oh, that is so unfortunate."
18,Ross, What?
19,Phoebe, Cute naked guy is really starting to put on weight.
20,Monica," (entering from bedroom) Okay, I’ll be back in just a minute. Oh,
Phoebe I’m sorry that I left lipstick marks on the phone."
21,Phoebe, You didn’t leave lipstick marks on the phone.
22,Monica," Oh, then it must’ve been you. Bye. (leaves)"
23,Phoebe, (angrily) Bye-bye! (to Ross) That’s why I moved out.
24,Ross," Hey, y'know while we’re on that, when are you gonna tell my sister
that you don’t live here anymore."
25,Phoebe, I think on some levels she already knows.
26,Ross," Phoebe, she doesn’t know that you sneak out every night, she
doesn’t know that you sneak back every morning, and she doesn’t know that
you’ve been living with your Grandmother’s for a week now."
27,Phoebe," Okay, well maybe not on those levels."
28,Chandler," (entering, with a goatee) Hey."
29,Ross, Hey.
30,Chandler," I’m never gonna find a roommate, ever."
31,Phoebe," Why, nobody good?"
32,Chandler," Well let’s see, there was the guy with the ferrets, that’s
plural. The spitter. Oh-ho, and yes, the guy that enjoyed my name so much he felt the need
to make a little noise every time he said it. Nice to meet you, Chandler Bing Bing!
Great apartment Chandler Bing, Bing!"
33,Ross, So how many more do you have tomorrow?
34,Chandler," Two. This photographer, who seemed really dull. And this actor guy,
who I’m not sure about, because when he called and I answered the phone
‘Chandler Bing,’ he said ‘Whoa-whoa, short message.’"
35,Monica," (entering) Ross (who has his foot on the coffee table), foot on the
floor or come over no more!"
36,Ross," (to Phoebe) Sure, your dresser is missing but this she notices."
37,Monica, What?
38,Ross," I have to go. Yeah, Carol should be home by now, soo..."
39,Chandler," Umm, how’s it going with you guys?"
40,Ross," Oh, better, actually. Y'know I-I-I think I finally figured out why we were
having so much trouble lately."
41,Phoebe," Oh, really?"
42,Ross," Yeah, y'know how I have you guys, well she doesn’t really have any
close friends that are just hers, but last week she meet this woman at the gym, Susan
something, and they really hit it off, and I-I-I think it’s gonna make a difference"
44,Chandler," Soo, ah, Eric, what kind of photography do ya do?"
46,Chandler," Yes, that is cool. Because I have models here y'know......never."
48,Chandler," Well, listen I ah, still have one more person to ah meet, but unless
it turns out to be your sister, I think you’re chances are pretty good. (Eric offers
to shake hands) All right. (Chandler hugs him.)"
50,Chandler," (running around the apartment pointing out things) Bedroom. Bathroom.
Living room. This right here is the kitchen, and thanks for coming by, (opens door)
Bye-bye."
51,Joey," Don’t you ah, don’t you wanna ask me any questions?"
52,Chandler, Sure. Ummm. What’s up?
53,Joey," Well, ah, I’m an actor. I’m fairly neat. I ah, I got my own TV.
Oh, and don’t worry I’m totally okay with the gay thing."
54,Chandler, What gay thing?
55,Joey," Ah, y'know just in general people being gay, thing. I’m totally cool
with that."
57,Chandler," Well okay Jerry, thanks for stopping by."
59,Monica, Hi.
60,Joey, Hey!
63,Chandler," Hey, Mon."
64,Monica, Hey-hey-hey. You wanna hear something that sucks.
65,Chandler, Do I ever.
66,Monica, Chris says they’re closing down the bar.
67,Chandler, No way!
68,Monica," Yeah, apparently they’re turning it into some kinda coffee place."
69,Chandler, Just coffee! Where are we gonna hang out now?
70,Monica, Got me.
71,Chandler, (to bartender) Can I get a beer.
72,Monica," Hey, did you pick a roommate?"
73,Chandler, You betcha!
74,Monica, Is it the Italian guy?
75,Chandler," Um-mm, yeah right!"
76,Monica, He’s so cute.
77,Chandler," Oh yes, and that’s what I want a roommate that I can walk around
with and be referred to as the funny one."
78,Monica," Oh look, the pool table’s free. Rack ‘em up. I’ll be back
in just a minute. Get ready for me to whip your butt."
79,Chandler," Okay, but after that, we’re shootin’ some pool."
80,Rachel," (sitting at a table with some of her friends) (to waitress) Oh, um, no,
no, no, no excuse me, hello. Hi. My friend ordered an onion, not an olive, and uh I
ordered a rum and Diet Coke, which I don’t think this is."
82,Rachel," That’s all right. (to her friends) I mean hard is it to get a
couple drinks right, huh?"
84,Rachel," Ummm, I think it’s time to see the ring again. (holds her hand out
and they all scream)"
86,Rachel," Yeah, I know."
88,Rachel," Oh, I don’t know. Well maybe it’s just the idea of Barry for
the rest of my life. I don’t know I think I feel like I need to have one last fling,
y'know, just to sorta get it out of my system. (Chandler is listening in very intensely)"
91,Rachel," I’m serious, I really, I think I need just to have
some...meaningless, sex y'know, with the next guy that I see."
93,Chandler," Excuse, I seem to have dropped my ball."
94,Rachel," Yeah, so?"
95,Chandler," (picks it up) And now I’ve picked it up again. (walks over to
Monica.)"
96,Monica," Oh my God, I went to high school with her. (to Rachel) Rachel! Hi!"
97,Rachel," Monica! Look! Hi! What do ya think? (shows her, her ring)"
98,Monica," Oh my God, you can’t even see where the Titanic hit it."
99,Rachel," Yes, his name is Barry, he’s a doctor, thank you very much."
100,Monica," Awww, just like you always wanted. Congratulations"
101,Rachel," Thank you. So how-how ‘bout you, are-are you seeing anybody?"
102,Monica," Aww, not right now."
103,Rachel," Oh, but that’s okay."
104,Monica, I know.
105,Rachel, Yeah.
107,Monica," So, I’ll get-get back to my friend."
108,Rachel," Oh, yeah, sure, sure, sure, sure. (points at Chandler, who holds up the
cue ball as a ‘Remember me?’ thing) Listen, can we please have lunch the next
time I’m in the city?"
109,Monica," Oh, that’d be great."
110,Rachel, Okay!
111,Monica, Thanks.
112,Rachel, Bye!
113,Monica," Bye! (to Chandler) Ten bucks says, I never see that woman again in my
life."
115,Ross," No real-, honey, really it’s fine, just g-go with Susan. Really, I,
no, I think girls night out is a great idea. Okay, okay, bye"
116,Phoebe, So what are they doing?
117,Ross," I don’t know, something girlie."
118,Phoebe," (to Monica, who’s entering) Hey, you’re early."
119,Monica, What are you doing with the lamp?
120,Phoebe, I’m just taking it to be re-wired.
121,Monica," Oh, well don’t take it to the same place you took the stereo,
‘cause they’ve had that thing for over a week."
123,Phoebe," No, no, Mr. Heckles no one is making any noise up here."
125,Phoebe, You don’t play the oboe!
127,Phoebe," Then I’m gonna have to ask you to keep it down. (slams the door in
his face.)"
140,Monica," Hi, again."
141,Joey, Hey! (goes into the apartment)
142,Chandler, (leaving to go to work) Hey!
143,Monica," Thank you soo, much."
144,Chandler," Oh, don’t thank me, thank the jerk that never showed up. Okay, I
gotta get to get to work."
146,Monica, You want some help with that?
147,Joey," Oh, no thanks, I got it. (picks it up) No I don’t!"
148,Monica, Whoa! Are you okay?
149,Joey," Whew! Stood up to fast, got a little head rush."
150,Monica," It’s the heat. (has her hand on his chest, and then pulls it away)
And-and the humidity."
151,Joey," That’s a uh, that’s a tough combination."
152,Monica, Do you wanna come in for some lemonade?
153,Joey," Like you wouldn’t believe. (they go into the apartment) Wow! This is
a great place."
154,Monica, Thank you. Just make yourself comfortable.
155,Joey, Gotcha.
156,Monica," This place is really my Grandmother’s. (Joey starts to take off all
of his clothes, while Monica gets the glasses and pours the lemonade.) I got it from her
when she moved to Florida, otherwise I could never afford a place like this. So if the
landlord ever asks, I’m 87 year old woman, who’s afraid of her VCR. So are you
thirsty?"
157,Joey," Oh, you bet I am!"
158,Monica," (turning around) Okay, here’s your penis!"
161,Monica, Oh my God!!! What are you doing?!!
162,Joey," You said, you wanna come in for some lemonade?"
163,Monica, So?!
164,Joey," Whoa, ah!! We’re you just gonna give me some lemonade?"
165,Monica, Yeah huh!! Cover yourself up!
166,Joey," Oh right, right."
167,Monica," I don’t believe this! When someone asks you in for lemonade, and to
you that means they wanna have sex?"
168,Joey," Well usually...yeah! Well, not just lemonade, iced tea, sometimes juice.
Well, sorry, I just, I thought you liked me. I’m such a jerk."
169,Monica," It’s okay. I suppose it could happen to anyone, not anyone I know,
but... By the way I can still see it."
171,Monica, Pheebs?
172,Phoebe, Huh?
173,Monica, Where’s your bed?
174,Phoebe," It’s not in the apartment? (Monica gives a ‘Come on’
look) Oh no. I can’t believe this is happening again."
175,Monica, What?
176,Phoebe," Okay, enough with the third degree! I-I’ve, I don’t live here
anymore."
177,Monica, What are you talking about?
178,Phoebe," I’m sorry, I-I-I-I don’t live here anymore. I-I didn’t
know how to tell you, but y'know everybody else knows!"
179,Monica, Everybody knows!
180,Phoebe," That was supposed to be a good thing, I forget why. Just listen, Monica,
I, do you know, okay, do you know, I couldn’t sleep for like a month because I got
like a dot of ink on one of the sofa cushions. "
181,Monica," Well, you-you coulda just turned the cushion over."
182,Phoebe," Yeah, I would’ve except I had a big spaghetti stain on the other
side."
183,Monica, What?!?!
184,Phoebe," Okay, this is what I’m talking about, this. I-I need to live in a
land where people can spill."
185,Monica, You can spill. In the sink.
186,Phoebe," Aw, honey it’s not your fault, y'know this is who you are, and I
love you, and I want us to be friends, and if I keep living here I don’t see that
happening."
187,Monica," I love you, too. "
188,Phoebe," Aww, good. (they hug) What?"
189,Monica, What? I’m just said.
190,Phoebe," No you’re not, you’re wondering which cushion it is."
192,Chandler," So ah, whatcha watching?"
193,Joey, Baywatch.
194,Chandler, What’s it about?
195,Joey, Lifeguards.
196,Chandler," Well, it sounds kinda stupid... (looks at the TV) Who’s she?"
197,Joey, Nicole Eggert. You'll like her.
199,Chandler, Wow! Look at them run.
200,Joey," They do that a lot. Hey, you want a beer?"
201,Chandler," Yeah, I’ll go get one."
202,Joey," No, no, no, don’t get up, I got a cooler right here."
204,Chandler," Well, hello!"
205,Monica, Hey.
206,Chandler, Do you have any beers? We’re out of beers.
207,Monica, (all depressed) Help yourself.
208,Chandler, You okay?
209,Monica, Phoebe moved out.
210,Chandler, Right.
211,Monica," I don’t understand, I mean am I so hard to live, is this why I
don’t have a boyfriend?"
212,Chandler," Noo!! You don’t have a boyfriend because....I don’t, I
don’t know why you don’t have a boyfriend. You should have a boyfriend."
213,Monica," Well, I think so."
214,Chandler," Oh-ho, come here. (goes and hugs her) Listen, you are one of my
favourite people and the most beautiful woman I’ve ever known in real life."
216,Ross, (all depressed) Hi. Where is everybody?
217,Phoebe," Oh, it’s already closed, Chris gave me the keys to lock up-what is
wrong?"
218,Ross," My marriage, I think my marriage is um, is kinda over."
219,Phoebe, Oh no! Why?
220,Ross," ‘Cause Carol’s a lesbian. (Phoebe is shocked) And, and I’m
not one. And apparently it’s not a mix and match situation."
221,Phoebe," Oh my God! I don’t believe it! Oh, you poor bunny."
222,Ross," (sets out a bunch of shot glasses and starts to poor himself a drink, many
drinks) I’m an idiot. I mean shoulda seen it, I mean Carol and I’d be out and
she’d, she’d see some beautiful woman, and, and she’d be Ross y'know look
at her, and I’d think, God, my wife is cool!"
223,Phoebe," Aw! Hey, do you think that Susan person is her lover?"
224,Ross," Well, now I do!!"
225,Phoebe, I’m sorry.
226,Ross," Seven years. I mean we’ve been together seven years, she’s the
only woman who’s ever loved me, and the only woman I’ve-I’ve ever...."
227,Phoebe," Aw, God Ross. Oh.(goes over and hugs him)"
229,Chandler," Umm, this is nice."
230,Monica," I know, it is isn’t it?"
231,Chandler," No, I mean it, this feels really good. Is it a hundred percent cotton?"
232,Monica," Yeah! And I got it on sale, too."
233,Chandler," Anyway, I should go, one of the lifeguards was just about to dismantle
a nuclear device."
234,Monica," Well, if you wanna get a drink later we can."
235,Chandler," Oh yeah, that sounds great. (starts to leave) Oh, and listen,
it’s, it’s gonna be...."
236,Monica, I know. Thanks. (Chandler leaves)
238,Ross," Maybe this would’ve happened if I’d been more nurturing, or
I’d paid more attention, or I... had a uterus. I can’t believe this!"
239,Phoebe," I know no, no, y'know you don’t deserve this, you don’t Ross.
You’re, you’re really, you’re so good. (kisses him on the cheek)"
240,Ross, Thanks.
241,Phoebe," And you’re so sweet. (kisses him on the other cheek) And
you’re kind (kisses him on the lips)"
242,Ross, Thanks. (kisses her on the lips)
244,Ross," Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait."
245,Phoebe, Huh?
247,Phoebe," Okay, it’s okay."
249,Phoebe, Oh. (they start kissing again)
250,Ross," Wait, wait, wait."
251,Phoebe, What?
252,Ross, My foot is stuck in the pocket.
253,Phoebe, What?
254,Ross," No, I can’t get it out."
255,Phoebe," Well, that’s not something a girl wants to hear."
256,Ross," No, come on don’t start. (they start kissing again) Ouch!"
257,Phoebe, What?
258,Ross, Stupid balls are in the way. (holds up two balls)
260,Ross, Oh well. It probably would’ve been the most constructive solution.
261,Phoebe, You have chalk on your face.
262,Ross, Huh? (the rest of the gang enters)
263,Phoebe," Oh, Ross you’re right, I don’t know why I always thought this
was real grass."
264,Monica," Hey, are you okay?"
265,Ross, My wife’s a lesbian.
266,Joey, Cool!!
267,Chandler," Ross-Joey, Joey-Ross. (they shake hands)"
268,Ross, Hi.
271,Chandler, I can’t believe you came back.
272,Rachel," Don’t say anything. I don’t wanna speak, I don’t wanna
think. I just want you to take me and kiss me and make love to me right here, right now."
275,Rachel, What?
277,Rachel," Oh, sorry."
279,Rachel," Um, (shyly) Barry."
0,Ross," So I told Carl, ‘Nobody, no matter how famous their parents are,
nobody is allowed to climb on the dinosaur.’ But of course this went in one ear and
out....."
1,Rachel," I love how he cares so much about stuff. If I squint I can pretend
he’s Alan Alda."
2,Monica," Oh good, another dinosaur story. When are those gonna become extinct?"
3,Chandler," If I was a superhero who could fly and be invisible, that
would be the best."
6,Phoebe, Who’s singing?
9,Ross," Hey. When you guys were kids and you played Happy Days, who were
you? I was always Richie."
10,Monica, I was always Joanne.
11,Joey," Question. Was ah, ‘Egg the Gellers!’ the war cry of your
neighbourhood?"
13,Phoebe, Ewww! Oh! It’s the Mattress King!
14,Joey, Booo!!
15,Chandler," (to Janice) Don’t look honey. Change the channel! Change the
channel!"
18,Chandler, What a wank!
20,Monica," I know! And four ninety-nine for a pillow top queen set, who cares about
the divorce, those babies will sell themselves. (they all stare at her) And I’m
appalled for you by the way."
23,Rachel," ‘Okay. (listens) Okay, daddy we’ll see you tomorrow night.
(listens) Okay bye-bye.’ (hangs up)"
24,Ross, We?
25,Rachel," Are ah, having dinner with my Dad tomorrow night, I hope that’s
okay."
26,Ross," Oh shoot, tomorrow’s not so good, I’m supposed to um, fall off
the Empire State building and land on a bicycle with no seat. Sorry."
27,Rachel," Ross, my father doesn’t hate you."
28,Ross," Please, he refers to me as ‘wethead’."
29,Rachel," But honey he calls everybody by a nickname! Okay, look, I know, all
right, just one dinner, please, just one night for me, please. I just want him to love you
like I do. (Ross looks at her) All right, well not exactly like I do, but, but, if you do
come to dinner, I’ll love you like I do in that black thing that you like."
30,Chandler, (leaning in) I’ll go.
31,Ross, Fine.
32,Rachel, Thank you.
33,Ross, Hi Gunther.
35,Joey," (entering) Hey, you guys!"
36,Phoebe, Hey!
37,Joey, Guess what?
38,Ross, What?
39,Joey, I got a gig!
41,Chandler," See, that’s why I could never be an actor. Because I can’t
say gig."
42,Phoebe," Yeah, I can’t say croissant. (realises) Oh my God!"
43,Monica, What’s the part?
44,Joey," Well, it’s not a part, no. I’m teaching acting for soap operas
down at the Learning Extension."
45,Ross, Come on! That’s great.
47,Joey," Yeah, yeah. It’s like my chance to give something back to the acting
community."
48,Ross, Y’know your probably not allowed to sleep with any of your students.
49,Joey, (glares at him) I know!
51,Phoebe," Ugh! I don’t know Monica. It feels funny just being here. I mean if
you buy a bed from Janice’s ex-husband, that’s like betraying Chandler."
52,Monica, Not at these prices.
53,Phoebe," (sees a little kid playing with a race car bed) (to kid) Hi. Y'know in
England this car would be on the other side of the store. (the kid just stares at her, and
she makes the ‘that went right over your head’ motion) Woo!"
54,Monica," (lying down on a mattress) Oh! Ohhhhh! Oh! Phoebe, come here. Aw, this
is my new bed. You gotta feel this bad boy."
55,Phoebe," Eh, Monica it, it feels so weird, y'know, Chandler’s your friend...
(hops onto the bed) Oh! Oh my God! Aw, all right take this bed, you can make other
friends."
57,Joey," Good evening. I’m Mr. Tribbiani. And I will be teaching acting for
soap operas. Now um, on my first day as (proudly) Dr. Drake Remoray on Days of Our
Lives, (looks for a reaction from his students, and gets none.) I learned that one of
the most important things in soap opera acting is reacting, this does not mean acting
again, it means, you don’t have a line, but someone else just did. And it goes like
this. (looks all intense for a moment and then gasps, the students cheer him) Thanks,
thanks, a lot. Oh, by the way, before I forget to work in soap operas some of you will
have to become much more attractive. All right, moving right along."
59,Joey, Hi!
60,Phoebe, Hey! Ooh! How was teaching last night?
61,Joey," Oh it was great. Yeah, you get to say stuff like, ’Hey, the bell
doesn’t dismiss you, I dismiss you.’"
62,Phoebe," Ooooh, nice."
63,Joey," Oh, and guess what, I got an audition for All My Children."
64,Phoebe," Oh, yay!"
65,Joey," Yeah, it’s this great part, this boxer named Nick. And I’m so,
so right for it, y'know, he’s just like me. Except he’s a boxer, and has an evil
twin."
67,Phoebe," Oh. (goes and answers the door and there is this huge black
delievery guy.) "
69,Phoebe, Okay.
71,Phoebe," Oh, do I have a middle name. All right Monica Velula Geller. It’s
that bedroom there. (points to Monica’s room)"
72,Joey," Hey, Monica bought a bed from the Mattress King?"
73,Phoebe," Yeah, so please, please, please, don’t say anything to Chandler."
74,Joey, You want me to lie to Chandler?
75,Phoebe, Is that a problem?
76,Joey, No.
77,Phoebe," Oh, hey, hey Nick the boxer let’s see what you got. All right ya,
put ‘em up. Come on. (they start shadow boxing)"
78,Joey," Hey, you’re ah, pretty good at this."
79,Phoebe," Yeah, well I had to learn, I was staying at the Y and some off the young
men weren’t acting Christian enough."
80,Joey, Ahh!
82,Joey, Hey now!
84,Joey, Hey!!! Oww!! And I’m bleeding.
85,Phoebe, Oh! Oh! Oh!
86,Joey," Okay, great."
87,Phoebe," Wow! And I’m a vegetarian! All right, all right, well I’m
sorry, we’ll put some ice on it. "
88,Joey, Okay.
89,Phoebe," ‘Kay, put your head back."
90,Joey, All right. I can’t see.
91,Phoebe," All right, I have ya. Oh God."
93,Phoebe," Oh, it’s the compulsively neat one by the window, okay."
96,Rachel, Hi Daddy!
98,Rachel, You remember Ross.
100,Ross, Nice to see you again Dr. Green. 
102,Ross," Ugh, museum."
104,Ross," There never was a library. I mean there are libraries, its just that I ah,
I never worked at one."
106,Ross," Yeah, if you’re really hungry. (Dr. Green stares at him) It was a
joke, I made a joke."
107,Rachel," Yeah, actually Daddy Ross is allergic to lobster."
109,Ross, It’s not a library...
112,Ross," So, Dr. Green, how’s the old boat."
114,Ross, It gives it a nice antiquey look.
116,Ross," Wow. I’m sorry, when I was a kid I lost a bike to that. (Rachel
giggles at that)"
118,Rachel, Okay.
119,Ross, Okay! (picks up a knife and pretends to stab his heart.)
120,Rachel, Aw honey stop! It’s not that bad.
121,Ross," Yeah. (sees the bill) Op! Uh-oh! I think your Dad must’ve added
wrong. He only tipped like four percent."
122,Rachel, Yeah. That’s Daddy.
123,Ross," That’s Daddy?! But doesn’t it bother you? You’re a
waitress."
124,Rachel," Yes, it bothers me Ross, but y'know if he was a regular at the coffee
house, I’d be serving him sneezers."
125,Ross, So?
126,Rachel," So. Ross, I’ve bugged him about this a million times, he’s not
gonna change."
127,Ross, You really serve people sneezers?
128,Rachel," Well um, I don’t."
130,Ross," Thanks again, Dr. Green."
134,Ross," Oh, ah, you don’t need that."
136,Ross," The carbon, it’s messy, I mean it gets on your fingers and causes,
the, the ah, night blindness."
138,Ross," Oh, yeah, that would be me, um, I have, I have a problem I-I tip way too
much, way, way, too much, it’s a sickness really."
139,Rachel," Yeah it is, it is. (to Ross) We really, really have to do something
about that."
140,Ross, I know.
142,Rachel," Oh Daddy, no he didn’t mean anything by that, he really
didn’t."
143,Ross," Nothing I do means anything, really."
145,Ross, Well Mr. Big Shot is better than ‘wethead’.
147,Joey," Okay, some tricks of the trade. Now, I’ve never been able to cry as
an actor, so if I’m in a scene where I have to cry, I cut a hole in my pocket, take a
pair of tweezers, and just start pulling. Or ah, or, let’s say I wanna convey that
I’ve just done something evil. That would be the basic ‘I have a fishhook in my
eyebrow and I like it’ (Does it by raising one eyebrow, and showing off the pretend
fishhook.) Okay, let’s say I’ve just gotten bad news, well all I do there is try
and divide 232 by 13. (looks all confused) And that’s how it’s done. Great soap
opera acting tonight everybody, class dismissed."
149,Joey, Hey-hey.
151,Joey," Awww, one of my students got an audition. I’m so proud."
153,Joey, You bet! What’s the part?
158,Rachel," You had to do it, didn’t you? You couldn’t just leave it
alone."
159,Ross," Four percent. Okay. I tip more than that when there’s a bug in my
food."
160,Rachel," Ross, tonight was about the two of you getting along. (Ross groans and
rubs his neck) Oh, would you just see my chiropractor, already."
161,Ross," Yeah, I’m gonna go to a doctor who went to school in a mini-mall."
163,Ross," Hey Pheebs, what are you doing?"
164,Phoebe," I’m, I’m freaking out! Monica kinda trusted me with something
and she shouldn’t have! All right, I haven’t lived here in a while, so I have to
ask you something. Does Monica still turn on the lights in her bedroom?"
165,Rachel, Um. yeah.
166,Phoebe, I am soo dead. (goes to Monica’s room)
167,Rachel," All right, look, here’s the bottom line Ross, this is fixable, if
we act fast, okay. So, I’ll invite him to brunch tomorrow and you can make nice."
168,Ross," Look, honey, I have tried to make nice, it doesn’t work."
169,Rachel," Okay, look, Ross, I realise that my Father is difficult, but that’s
why you have got to be the bigger man here."
170,Ross," Look sweetie, I could be the bigger man, I could be the biggest man, I
could be a big, huge, giant man, and it still wouldn’t make any difference, except
that I could pick your Father up and say ‘Like me! Like me tiny doctor!’"
171,Rachel," Okay, well can’t you just try it one more time Ross? For me? For
me?"
172,Ross," Rachel one brunch is not gonna solve anything. You gotta face it, okay
we’re never gonna get along."
173,Rachel," Okay, well you are just gonna have too, okay. Because I already got a
Mother and a Father who cannot stay in the same room together, okay, I don’t wanna
have to have a separate room for you too!! (starts to cry)"
174,Ross," Okay, okay, okay. (hugs her) I’ll get the bagels."
176,Monica, (sees the bed) What’s this?
177,Phoebe, Isn’t it cool! Varoom! Varoom!
178,Monica, This is not the bed I ordered!
179,Phoebe," I know, you must’ve won like a contest or something! "
181,Monica, Phoebe!
183,Monica, Why is this car in my bedroom?
184,Phoebe," I’m sorry, okay, I-I wasn’t looking, and the store says that
they won’t take it back because you signed for it..."
185,Monica, When did I sign for it?
186,Phoebe," When I was you! Y'know what, it’s all Joey’s fault,
‘cause he left his nose open!"
187,Monica, Did you make brownies today?
188,Chandler," Knock, knock."
189,Monica," (to Phoebe) Quick, take off your dress, he won’t notice the bed."
190,Chandler," Hey, I’m going for sushi does anybody want.. (enters and sees the
bed) Whoa-whoa, somebody missed the off ramp."
191,Phoebe, It’s Monica’s bed. What?
192,Chandler, Okay. (to Monica) It’s a racecar.
193,Phoebe," So. This has always been Monica’s bed, what you’re just
noticing now, how self-involved are you?"
194,Chandler," Okay, well it this bed isn’t new, how come there is plastic on
the mattress?"
195,Monica," Sometimes I have bad dreams. (starts to break down, and Phoebe offers
her, her hand to comfort her.)"
198,Joey, Wow! That was good. That was...(points to his pocket) Tweezers?
200,Joey, Whoa. That was really good.
204,Chandler, You told him to play the boxer gay!!
205,Joey," Well, I-I might’ve said supergay."
206,Chandler, You totally screwed him over.
207,Monica," Joey, you’re this guy’s teacher. I mean how could you do this?"
208,Joey," Because, Monica, the guy’s so good, and I really, really want this
part."
209,Phoebe," Well, if you really, really want it, then it’s okay."
211,Rachel, (opening the door) Hi Daddy.
213,Ross," Dr. Green. How are you? (offers his hand, and Dr. Green puts his scarf on
it.)"
215,Ross, Thank you for teaching me a valuable lesson.
217,Ross," (to Rachel) Okay, that’s it, I can’t take it anymore."
218,Rachel," What? What? He’s interested in you. He-he likes your hair, he just
wants to know how you got here."
219,Ross," Oh, please. Sweetie it’s hopeless, okay, I’m just gonna go.
(starts to leave rubbing his neck)"
220,Rachel, What?!
221,Ross," Look, look I’m sorry. It’s just that...."
223,Rachel," He’s got this thing. And I keep telling him to go to my
chiropractor..."
225,Ross, Thank you! That’s what I keep saying.
226,Rachel," Excuse me, Dr. Bobby happens to be an excellent doctor."
227,Ross, Uh.
229,Rachel, Well that’s his last name.
230,Ross, And his first name.
232,Rachel, It’s Robert Bobby.
234,Rachel," And um, excuse me, he helps me."
235,Ross, Oh-ho please. Ask her how?
237,Rachel, With my alignment. I’ve got one leg shorter than the other.
239,Ross, Argue with that.
240,Rachel," What? It’s true, my right leg is two inches shorter."
242,Ross, I know that!
244,Rachel," I’m sorry, let her?"
245,Ross," What can I do, she doesn’t listen to me about renter’s insurance
either."
247,Rachel, No.
250,Ross," Hey, would you ah, would you like some juice?"
252,Ross, Okay. (to Rachel) Wow! This is going so well. Did you see us? Did you see?
253,Rachel," Yeah honey, I’m standing right there! Why didn’t you just tell
him about the mole I haven’t got checked yet."
254,Ross, Excellent!
256,Joey," (sadly) There will come a time in each of your careers when you’ll
have a chance to screw over another soap opera actor. I had such an opportunity in the
recent, present. And I’m ashamed to say that I took it, I advised a fellow actor to
play a role, homosexually. Yeah, we both auditioned for the part, and uh, as it turned
out, they ah, they liked the stupid gay thing and cast him. And now, he’s got a two
year contract opposite Susan Luchhi, the first lady of daytime television, and me, me
I’m stuck here teaching a bunch of people, most of whom are too ugly to even be on
TV. I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry. (he gets a huge round of applause from
his students.) Thank you."
259,Monica," Yeah, I talked to you on the phone, I’m the lady that got stuck
with the racecar bed."
261,Joey," All right, Jester man, look we wanna see the king."
263,Joey," Oh-ho-kay, I’m talking to the king. (starts to go to a back room)"
270,Chandler," Varrrrrroom! Hey! Watch it lady! Varrrrrrrrrrom! (makes a screeching
sound as he pretends to stomp on the brakes.) Hey-hey good lookin’! (honks the
bed’s little horn on the steering wheel.) Varrrrrrrrroom. (notices Rachel and stops)
All right, I’ll leave. My bed’s so boring."
0,Rachel, Here you go Pheebs. Who else wants one of my special homemade brownies? 
1,Chandler, I will have one. (Ross and him both take one.)
3,Chandler," Okay, I’m not gonna have one."
4,Ross, Neither will I. (they both put back the brownies.)
5,Phoebe," No, no, it’s just my tooth."
6,Chandler," All right I’ll have one. (he and Ross take another brownie,)"
7,Ross," So what’s a matter, you need a dentist? I’ve got a good one."
8,Phoebe," No thanks, I have a good one too. I just, I, I can’t see him."
9,Chandler, See that is the problem with invisible dentists.
10,Ross, Why? Why can’t you go to him?
11,Phoebe," Because, every time I go to the dentist, somebody dies."
12,Chandler," That is so weird, because every time I go to the dentist, I look down
the hygienist’s blouse."
13,Rachel," Phoebe, what? Umm...what?!"
14,Phoebe," Yeah, yeah, first there was my aunt Mary, and then there was umm, John,
my mailman, and then my, my cowboy friend ‘Albino Bob’."
15,Rachel, And all these people actually died?
16,Phoebe," Yes, while I was in the chair! That’s why I take such good care of
my teeth now, y'know, it’s not about oral hygiene, I floss to save lives!"
17,Ross," Pheebs, come on, you didn’t kill anybody, these people just happened
to die when you went to the dentist. It’s, it’s, it’s just ah, a
coincidence."
18,Phoebe," Well tell that to them. Oh! You can’t, their dead."
21,Ross," Thanks, Gunther. (takes the plate Gunther serves him and Rachel comes up
and kisses him) (to Rachel) Hey! (to Gunther) Umm, can I get a napkin too?"
23,Phoebe, (trying to bite into an apple) Ow! Ow! (drops the apple in disgust.)
24,Rachel," Phoebe, your in pain, would you just go to the dentist, just go."
25,Phoebe," All right, fine, fine, but if you’re my next victim, don’t
come back as a poltergeist and like suck me into the TV set."
26,Rachel, I promise.
27,Phoebe," Although, don’t feel like you can’t visit."
28,Joey," (entering with Monica) Hey, is, is, is Chandler here?"
29,Ross," (patting his clothes like he is looking for his wallet) No, no he’s
not."
30,Monica," You guys, Joey just saw Janice kissing her ex-husband."
31,Ross," What? (to Joey) So what are you going to do? I mean how, how are you going
to tell Chandler?"
32,Joey," Well, I was thinking about that and I, I think the best way would be, to
not."
33,Rachel," Joey, you can’t keep this to yourself, if you know about this, you
have to tell him."
34,Joey," It’ll kill him. I mean it’ll, it’ll just kill him."
35,Phoebe," Well, you could wait ‘til I go to the dentist, maybe I’ll
kill him."
37,Joey," (looking out the window) Ewww! Ugly Naked Guy is using his new hammock.
It’s like a Play-Doo Fat Factory. "
38,Phoebe," Well, I’m going to the dentist, so listen, okay, just be on the
look out for anything that, that, that you can fall into, or, or that can fall on you,
or... All right, just look out! Okay, And um, I also just wanna, I just wanna tell you all
that um...... (starts to cry and runs out)"
39,Ross," Okay, I have a problem I have to go into work for a few hours, some kids
messed up the Homo Sapien display."
40,Joey, What did they do?
41,Ross," Well, they painted over the word ‘Sapien’ for one thing, then
they rearranged the figures, let’s just leave it at that."
42,Monica," So, do you want me to watch Ben for you?"
43,Ross," Yes, that’s what I was going to ask, thank you."
44,Rachel, Whoa! Wait! Hello! What about me?
45,Ross," You? You! Want to watch Ben? (in the background Monica mouths
‘Don’t worry, I’ll be here the whole time.’ to Ross.) Yes! That’d
be great, no, I just wanted to ask Monica, because I know how empty her life is. (Monica
sarcastically mouths ‘Yeah!’ and holds up her thumb.)"
46,Joey," Hey-hey, Ross?"
47,Ross, Yeah.
48,Joey, I’ve got a science question.
49,Ross, Hmm?
50,Joey," If the Homo Sapiens, were in fact ‘Homo-sapien’, is that why
there extinct?"
51,Ross," Joey, Homo Sapiens are people."
52,Joey," Hey-hey, I’m not judging."
54,Rachel," (holding Ben) Look Benny, spoon. (moves it back and forth) Spoon. Come
on! All right, y'know what I think he’s bored."
55,Monica," Here. Ben, do you wanna play the airplane game, do you wanna show
Rachel? Come here. (takes Ben) We’re gonna do something fun. Okay. (throws Ben up in
the air a little bit and catches him) Weee!! (moves into the living room and does it
again) Weee!! (starts to walk back into the kitchen as she does it again, and hits
Ben’s head on that wooden beam across the ceiling.)"
57,Monica," (to Ben) Who’s so brave, you’re so brave, yes you are,
you’re so brave."
58,Rachel," Okay. Okay honey, he’s fine, he’s fine, let’s just put
him down. Come here, Ben. (sets him on the couch) See that’s a good boy. (to Monica)
How could you do that to him!! Ross trusted me, what is he going to say?!"
59,Monica," He’s not gonna say anything, because we’re not gonna tell him."
60,Rachel, We’re not?!
61,Monica, No we’re not.
62,Rachel," All right, I like that. "
63,Monica, Okay.
64,Rachel," So we’re okay, we’re okay, we’re okay, (starts to exam
Ben) aren’t we? No, we’re not okay, we’re not okay, there’s a bump,
there’s a bump."
65,Monica, Oh my God! Well push it in! Push it in!
66,Rachel, I cannot push it in!
67,Monica," Okay, we’re gonna need a distraction."
68,Rachel," Okay, okay, okay."
69,Monica, I got it!
70,Rachel, Okay.
71,Monica," The second that Ross walks in that door, I want you take him back to
your bedroom and do whatever it is that you do that makes him go, (high pitched) rweee!!"
72,Rachel, Or. We could put a hat on his head.
73,Monica, A hat! Yes! We need a hat.
74,Rachel, We need a hat..
75,Monica, Where are we gonna find a tiny little hat?
76,Rachel," Oh, oh, oh, I’ll get ‘Rainy Day Bear’!! (runs to get him)"
77,Monica," Because he’ll know what to do? (Rachel comes out of her room with a
bear that’s dressed in a rain suit.) Oh my God, you’re a genius!"
78,Rachel," Oh God, oh God, it’s sowed on though."
79,Monica, Give it. Give it.
80,Rachel, Okay.
83,Rachel," Oh, it’s just like a bloodbath in here today."
85,Chandler," Hey! Hold on a minute, hold on a second. Do you think these pearls are
nice?"
86,Joey, I’d really prefer a mountain bike.
87,Chandler," Janice’s birthday is coming up, I want to get her something
speacial. Come in here with me."
88,Joey," Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, whoa. Do you ah, want to get her something
speacial, get her flowers, get her candy, get her gum, girls love gum."
89,Chandler," That’s a good idea, ‘Dear Janice have a Hubba-Bubba
birthday’. I would like to get her something serious."
90,Joey," Oh, you want something serious. Y'know what you should do, you should get
her one of those um, barium enemas. Those are dead serious."
91,Chandler," All right. Look, I’m gonna go in here, and you don’t buy me
anything ever. (starts to go into the store)"
92,Joey," (stopping him) No, no, you can’t, you can’t, okay, you
can’t, you can’t buy her pearls, you just can’t, you can’t, you
can’t."
93,Chandler, Why not?!
94,Joey," Oh God. Uh, okay, here’s the thing, this is the thing, okay, the
thing is..."
95,Chandler, What is the thing?
96,Joey," Okay. I went down to the ‘Mattress King’ showroom and, and I saw
Janice, kissing her ex-husband."
97,Chandler, (shocked) What?
98,Joey, They were in his office.
99,Chandler," Well she, she wouldn’t do that, she’s with, she’s with
me."
100,Joey," I’m telling you man, I saw it."
101,Chandler," Yeah, well, you’re wrong! Okay, you’re wrong."
102,Joey," I’m not wrong! I wish I was. I’m sorry. Bet that barium enema
doesn’t sound so bad now, huh?"
104,Monica, It just makes more sense as an ensemble.
105,Rachel, Right.
106,Monica," Besides, it takes the focus off the hat."
107,Phoebe, (running through the door) No! Oh! You’re alive! You’re alive!
108,Rachel," See Pheebs, I promised you no one would die, didn’t I?"
109,Phoebe," Yeah, well, we’ll see about that. Can I use your phone? I just
wanna call everyone I know."
110,Monica," Sure, we have no money, go ahead."
111,Phoebe," (on phone) ‘Hey! You’re not dead! Okay, see ya!’"
113,Monica, Oh my God! He just said my name! Did you hear that?
115,Rachel," Okay, I heard that."
116,Monica, Did he just say ‘Monica bang’?
117,Rachel, Uh-huh.
118,Monica, Oh my God! He’s gonna rat me out!
120,Monica," Oh-ho-ho, sweetie, sweetie, you gotta stop saying that, now. It’s
no big deal, it’s not even worth mentioning, you see we all do it all the time. See
watch this, Ben, Ben, Ben. (goes over and starts hitting her head on the post) Ow, Monica
bang! (does it again) Everybody bang. (repeats) Ben bang. (repeats) Rachel bang. (repeats)
Bang, Rachel bang! Oh, isn’t that fun?"
121,Rachel," (goes over and hits her head on the post) Look at that! (repeats) Look
at that! (repeats) We all do it. (repeats) Okay, I’m stopping now."
122,Monica, You okay?
123,Rachel," Oh yeah! Y'know, if it’s not a headboard, it’s just not worth
it."
126,Chandler," Ah, I don’t know, you tell me. Anything you ah, wanna tell me,
because, if you ah, you should, if you, you would, tell me."
128,Chandler," You tell me! Maybe, it’s because I was just fooling with my ex!
Oh no-no-no-no, no-no-no-no, that was you!!"
130,Chandler, All right!
132,Chandler," Joey told me, he saw you two kissing."
134,Chandler, No! In his office! How many kisses were there?
136,Chandler," Wh-wh-why, wh-why, why, why was there kissing!? There should be no
kissing!!"
138,Chandler, (giving her a bag) Here.
141,Chandler," I’ll take it! All right look, I gotta know. Are you finished with
me? (Janice shakes her head no) Are you finished with him? (Janice shakes her head no) Do
you still love him? (Janice shakes her head yes) Do you still love me? (Janice shakes her
head yes) All right look, (grabs the bag) I’m gonna need an actual answer here okay,
so which is it, him or me? (his phone starts to ring)"
143,Phoebe, (rushing in) Okay. If you’re alive you answer your phone!
146,Monica," Okay, Ben, I won’t tell your daddy that you had ice cream for
dinner, if you don’t tell about our little bonking incident."
147,Rachel," Monica, number one, I don’t think Ben understands the concept of
bribery, and number two, I... (Joey starts laughing in the background) (to Joey) What?!"
148,Joey, You said number two.
149,Rachel, I also said number one.
150,Joey, I know. (giggles harder)
151,Ross, (entering) Hey! Everyone.
152,Rachel, Hi!
153,Ross, How’s my little boy?
154,Rachel," He’s perfect, he’s never been better."
155,Ross," (noticing the outfit he is wearing) What’d you do, take him whaling?"
157,Ross," Oh my God, he just said your name, that’s great! Good job Ben."
159,Monica," Oh that’s right, that’s what I’d sound like if I
exploded."
160,Phoebe," Woo-Hoo! The curse is broken! I called everybody I know, and everyone is
alive."
161,Joey, Uh.
162,Phoebe, What?
163,Joey, Ugly Naked Guy looks awfully still. (Phoebe runs to the window and gasps.)
165,Phoebe," Oh my God! I killed him! I killed another one! And this curse is getting
stronger too, to bring down something that big."
166,Rachel, Well maybe he’s just taking a nap.
167,Joey," I’m tellin’ ya, he hasn’t moved since this morning."
168,Monica," All right, we should call somebody."
169,Ross," And tell them what? The naked guy we stare at all the time isn’t
moving."
170,Rachel," Well, we have gotta find out if he’s alive."
171,Monica, How are we gonna do that? There’s no way.
172,Joey," Well, there is one way. His window’s open, I say, we poke him."
174,Joey," Hey! Y'know how we ah, save all those chopsticks for no reason we get when
we get Chinese food?"
175,Chandler, Yeah.
176,Joey," Well, now we got a reason."
177,Chandler, What?
178,Joey," Well, we’re fashioning a very long poking device."
179,Chandler, All right.
180,Joey," Hey uh, what’s a matter?"
181,Chandler, I talked to Janice.
182,Joey," Oh my God, is she going back to him?"
183,Chandler," She doesn’t know. Says she loves us both. Y'know I woke up this
morning and I was in love, well I was happy. Y'know it serves me right for buying that
twelve pack of condoms. And now I can’t even return them, because she choked on the
reciept!"
184,Joey," What are you ah, what are you gonna do?"
185,Chandler," I don’t know, y'know. What, what, would you do?"
186,Joey," Well, it doesn’t matter what I would do."
187,Chandler," Come on, tell me."
188,Joey," All right, you’re probably not gonna want to hear this but ah, if it
was me, and this is just me, (Chandler gets ready to throw another dart) I would ah, I
would bow out."
189,Chandler," What? (turns around quickly still ready to throw the dart and Joey
quickly ducks and hides behind the chair) What are you, what are you talking about?"
190,Joey," They have a kid together, y'know. They’re like, they’re like a
family, and if, I don’t know, there’s chance they could make that work, I know I
wouldn’t want to be the guy who stood in the way of that. Are you okay? Do you wanna
ah, come poke a nude guy?"
192,Ross," Well, he’s finally alseep. About that ah, bump on his head?"
193,Rachel," Are you, are you, are you sure it’s ah, a new bump? I mean, no
offense, I’ve always thought of Ben as a fairly bumpy headed child."
194,Ross," It’s okay if he bumps his head, kids bump their heads all the time,
y'know, it was your first time babysitting, I figured you did the best you could."
195,Rachel, (confidently) I did!
196,Ross, I know! I’m saying you have to watch them all the time.
197,Rachel," I did!! I watched! I watched! I watched Monica bang his head against
that thing!"
198,Ross, Monica did it?
200,Ross, Monica?
201,Monica, Yeah.
202,Ross," Umm, did you notice anything wierd about Ben today?"
203,Monica, No. Why?
204,Ross," Well, I was just playing with him, and y'know we were doing the alphabet
song, which he used to be really good at, but suddenly he’s leaving out ‘e’
and ‘f.’ It’s like they just ah, I don’t know, fell out of his head."
205,Monica, Really?!
206,Ross," Oh, and also, he’s, he’s walkin’ kind of funny, his left
leg is moving a lot faster than his right leg, and he’s in there just sort of
y'know... (walks around in a circle) "
207,Monica," Oh my God, I wrecked your baby!! (runs into the bedroom)"
208,Rachel, I hope it’s still funny when you’re in hell.
209,Monica," (coming out of the bedroom) You jerk! You know how much I love that kid!
(starts to chase Ross around the living room)"
210,Ross, Monica bang! Monica bang! (runs into one of the posts) Ow!
211,Rachel, I’ll get the hat.
213,Chandler," Janice, I have something I need to tell you, and I want you to let me
get through it, because it’s, it’s, it’s not gonna be easy."
215,Chandler," I think you should go back with Gary. I don’t wanna be the guy
that breaks up a family, y'know when my parents split up, it was because of that guy.
Whenever I would see him I was always think y'know ‘You’re the reason, you are
the reason why their not together.’ and I hated that guy. And it didn’t matter
how nice he was, or how happy he made my Dad."
217,Chandler," Yeah, well. It’s the right thing to do."
219,Chandler, Then don’t leave me!
221,Chandler," Forget what I said, I was babbling! Pick me!"
223,Chandler," No you don’t! No, no, no, I say you have to give your divorce
another chance."
225,Chandler, Ohhh. Don’t go.
227,Chandler, No. No! No! No!
229,Chandler," I don’t care! (turns around and to the people watching them) I
don’t care!!"
231,Chandler, You can’t leave! I have your shoe!
235,Joey," All right now remember, something this big and long is going to be
difficult to manuver, fortunately I have a lot of experience in that area."
236,Ross," Can we please focus here, a naked man’s life hangs in the balance!"
237,Phoebe," I’m telling you he’s dead. What we are about to have here is a
dead fat guy on a stick."
238,Joey," All right, ladies and gentlemen, let’s poke. (they start to advance
the giant poking device) Steady. Steady. Okay, a little higher. Careful of the angle.
Okay, okay, we’re approaching the window (as he says this the camera cuts to their
view of Ugly Naked Guy, so that we actually see him!) Thread the needle. Thread the
needle. "
240,Phoebe, He’s alive! He’s a-live!!!
241,Monica," And yet, we’re still poking him."
242,Joey," Okay, retract the device, retract the device."
243,Ross, He does not look happy.
244,Rachel," Hey-hey, now he’s showing us his poking device."
245,Joey," Hey, that’s never gonna make it all the way over here, buddy!"
248,Chandler," (singing) I’ll hold you close in my arms. (Phoebe
enters) I can’t resist your charms. And love...."
249,Phoebe, (joining him) Love....
251,Chandler, (high pitched) No you know I don’t mind.
253,Chandler, I know.
254,Phoebe, I know.
255,Chandler, I’ve found.
256,Phoebe, I’ve found....
1,Phoebe," Hey, it’s your Thanksgiving too, y'know, instead of watching
football, you could help."
3,Monica," Okay, Rachel, you wanna put the marshmellows in concentric circles."
4,Rachel," No Mon, you want to put them in concentric circles. I want
to do this. "
6,Monica, Every year.
9,Phoebe," Y'know, for once, I am going to sit down and try to watch one of these
things. (just as she sits down)."
10,Ross, Halftime.
11,Joey," Hey, who wants to ah, throw the ball around a little, maybe get a little
three on three going?"
12,Rachel, Oh! That would be sooo much fun!
13,Phoebe," Oh, can I play too? I’ve never played football, like ever. "
14,Joey," Great, you can cover Chandler."
15,Chandler," No, no, no, I don’t, I don’t really wanna play."
16,Joey, Come on man! You never want to do anything since you and Janice broke up.
17,Chandler," That’s not true! I wanted to wear my bathrobe and eat peanut
clusters all day. I wanted to start drinking in the morning. Don’t say that I
don’t have goals!"
18,Joey," Chandler, you have to start getting over her. All right, if you play, you
get some fresh air, maybe it’ll take your mind off Janice, and if you don’t
play, everyone will be mad at you ‘cause the teams won’t be even. Come on."
19,Chandler," Yeah, all right, I’ll play."
20,Phoebe, Yay!!
21,Rachel, Let’s do it! Ross?
22,Ross, What?
23,Rachel, Do you wanna play football?
24,Ross," Um, Monica and I aren’t supposed to play football."
25,Joey, Says who? Your mom?
27,Monica," Well, every, every Thanksgiving um, we used to have a touch football
game called the ‘Geller Bowl.’"
28,Chandler," No, no, no, you say that proudly."
29,Monica," Anyway, Ross and I were always captains, and um, it got kind’ve
competitive and one year, Geller Bowl VI, I accidentally broke Ross’s nose."
30,Ross," It was soo not an accident. She saw I was about to tag her, so she
threw her big fat grandma arm elbow right into my face. And just keep running."
31,Monica," To score the winning touchdown, by the way."
32,Ross," Whoa, whoa, whoa, ho, ho, ho, you did not win the game, the touchdown
didn’t count, because of the spectacularly illegal, oh and by the way savage nose
breaking."
33,Monica, (to Chandler and Joey) I won the game.
34,Ross, Oh yeah! Then how come you didn’t get the Geller Cup?
35,Rachel," Um, there was a Geller Cup?"
36,Ross," Yes, it was the trophy you got if you won the game. But our Dad said,
‘nobody won that game, ‘ and he was sick of our fighting, so he took the trophy
and.... (pauses to collect himself, as he is on the verge of tears saying this) threw it
in the lake."
37,Chandler, And was the curse lifted?
38,Ross," Anyway. That’s when our Mom said we were not to play football ever
again."
39,Monica," Y'know what, I think we should play a game. I mean come on, it’s
been twelve years."
40,Ross, Can I see you for a second?
42,Monica, (shouting) Once!!
43,Ross," All right, we’re gonna play."
44,Chandler," But wait a minute though, how are we gonna get there, though, because
my Mom won’t let me cross the street."
46,Monica, Okay. Let’s bring it in.
47,Rachel," Wait no, honey, honey throw it to me, throw it to me."
48,Ross, Here you go. (throws her the ball)
49,Rachel," (knocking it down instead of catching it) That almost hit me in the
face."
50,Joey," All right, we have to pick captains."
51,Chandler, And then Tineals.
52,Phoebe," Okay, so how do we decide that?"
53,Monica," Well, why don’t we just bunny up."
56,Monica," Okay, looks like Ross and I are captains. Okay, so um, I bunnied first
so that means I get to pick first. Joey."
57,Joey, Thank you.
58,Rachel," Monica, I’m your best friend."
59,Ross," Sweetie, don’t worry you’ll get picked. Chandler."
60,Rachel, Ross!
61,Monica, Phoebe.
63,Ross," Sweetie, now I pick you."
64,Rachel, You don’t pick me! You’re stuck with me!
65,Ross," Okay. All right. So let’s see, let’s play from the trash can, to
the lightpost. Right. Two hand touch, we’ll kick off."
66,Monica," All right people listen, I’ve got exactly twenty-eight minutes
before I have to baste again."
67,Chandler, Wow! Just like in the pros.
68,Monica, Huddle up.
69,Joey," (to his team) All right, huddle up, right over here."
70,Phoebe," Wait for me! Wait for me! Wait for me! Oh cool, this is my first huddle."
71,Monica, Okay.
72,Phoebe," Okay, so what do you guys really think of Chandler?"
73,Monica," Okay, Phoebe you know what you’re doing right?"
74,Phoebe, Yeah.
75,Monica," Okay, Joey’s gonna catch it, and you and I are gonna block."
76,Phoebe, What’s block?
77,Monica," Phoebe, I thought you said you know what you’re doing?"
78,Phoebe, I thought you meant in life.
79,Monica, Break.
81,Chandler," The ball is Janice. The ball is Janice. (goes to kick the ball but
kicks Ross’s foot instead.)"
82,Ross, Oww!! Son of a...!! Ow! Come on!
83,Chandler," Sorry. I’m sorry. Y'know what, we’re just gonna throw it."
85,Joey, I got it. (catches the ball)
86,Phoebe, Go! Go! Go!
88,Monica, Score!! 7 to nothing!
89,Rachel," (coming over to Ross, who is just getting up) Are you okay?"
90,Ross," Come on, let’s go!"
91,Monica, Losers walk!
92,Ross," Yeah, losers talk!"
93,Chandler," No, no, no, actually losers rhyme."
95,Chandler," (coming up under center, just like a real quarterback does, and puts
his hands between Ross’s legs.) Twenty-three!! Seventy-four!! (Ross stands up and
looks at him) You wanna go shotgun?"
96,Ross, Yeah!
97,Chandler, (from the shotgun) Hike!
100,Rachel, Over here!
102,Rachel, (proud of her self) I almost caught that one!
103,Chandler," Great! Now, the score is 7 to almost 7."
104,Ross," Okay, (to Chandler) this play, I want you to do a down and out to the
right. Okay. Break!"
105,Rachel," Wait, what am I gonna do?"
106,Ross," You, you go long."
107,Rachel," Wait, how long?"
108,Ross, Until we start to look very small.
109,Rachel, Okay.
110,Ross, Break!!
112,Joey, Set....hike!
113,Ross," One-Mississippi, two-Mississippi, switch! Switch! Switch!!"
114,Chandler," No, no, no, no, no!"
116,Joey," Haaaaa! Hey-hey, thanks for stopping our ball."
118,Joey," Yeah! Wow, your like from a whole other country."
120,Joey," Hi-hi, I’m Joey."
122,Joey," I’m sorry Dutch, I didn’t get that last little bit."
123,Chandler," (running up) Hey Joey, do you wanna play football or you wanna.. (sees
Marhan) Hi, I’m Chandler."
125,Joey," Her name is Dutch, and also Marklan."
127,Joey, Mar-klan.
129,Chandler, Mar-haaaan.
131,Monica," Come on guys! Let’s go! Come on, it’s second down."
132,Ross," Uh, hello, it’s third down."
133,Monica," No it’s not, it’s second."
134,Ross, Wow!
135,Monica," Wow, what?"
136,Ross, It just amazes me that your still pulling stuff like this.
137,Monica, Pulling what? It’s second down.
138,Ross," Okay, it’s second down. (turns away) Take all the second downs you
need."
139,Monica, I heard that!
140,Ross," Well, I said it loud."
145,Chandler," Well, that went well."
146,Joey, I think so.
147,Chandler," Y'know, I was thinking about ah, asking her for her number."
148,Joey," Thanks man, but I think it makes a stronger statement if I ask for it
myself, y'know."
149,Chandler," Whoa-ho, whoa! No, I was thinking about y'know for me, as a part of
that whole getting over Janice thing you were talking about."
150,Joey," Oh, yeah, that. All right, means that much to ya, I’ll let you have
her."
151,Chandler," Thanks. What, let me have her?! What do mean? Like if you didn’t
I wouldn’t have a shot?"
152,Joey," Well I don’t like to say it out loud, but, yeah! Don’t feel bad
man, we all have our strengths. You’re better with numbers and stuff."
153,Chandler," Math!! You’re giving me math! All right, look y'know what, forget
about it, you go for the girl, we’ll see who gets her."
155,Ross," Chandler, I want you to run a post pattern to the left, okay. And
sweetie.."
156,Rachel," Yeah, I know, go long. Y'know, it’s like all I’m doing is
running back and forth from the huddle."
157,Ross," Well ah, you wanna just stay out there?"
158,Rachel, Can I see that for second.
159,Ross, Yeah.
161,Ross, Okay. Hut! Hike!
163,Joey, Fumble!
165,Joey, What the hell’s the matter with you?! This is my favourite jersey.
166,Chandler," Well now you have two. Hey, I am good at math."
167,Joey," All right, that’s it. Y'know I was still gonna let you have her. But
now, forget about it. Prepare to feel very bad about yourself."
168,Chandler," Hey! Well, I’ve been preparing for that my entire life! Or
something about you that’s mean!"
169,Monica," All right, come on guys, let’s go! Tie score, and we’re
runnin’ out of time. Forty-two!! Thirty-eight!! Hike! (the timer sounds as Monica
throws the ball to Phoebe.)"
170,Phoebe, Oh I got it!! (catches the ball) Oh! Ew! Broken boob! Ow!
171,Joey," Pheebs, run!"
172,Monica," Run, Phoebe, run!"
174,Phoebe, Touchdown!! Touchdown!!
175,Ross," Uh, hello, the buzzer buzzed. It doesn’t count."
176,Monica, After the snap!
177,Ross, Before the snap!
178,Joey, After!!
179,Chandler, Before!!
180,Rachel," Now, does it really matter?"
182,Phoebe," Well, okay, I made a touchdown. It was my first touchdown. So?"
183,Ross," Oh Pheebs, that’s great. It doesn’t count."
184,Monica, Does so count!
185,Ross," Cheater, cheater, compulsive eater."
186,Phoebe, Oh my God!
187,Monica," Y'know what, that’s fine, maybe you haven’t grown up, but I
have."
188,Ross," Oh-ho, okay."
189,Monica, Dead leg!! (kicks him in the thigh.)
190,Ross," Ow! Ow! Okay, okay, fine, fine! All right, you wanna win by cheating, go
ahead, all right. Phoebe the touchdown does count, you win."
191,Phoebe, Woo-yay!!
192,Monica," No! Listen, I’m not gonna go through this with you again, okay.
Just once I wanna beat when you can’t blame it on the broken nose, the buzzer, or the
fact that you thought you were getting mono. Let’s just call this, tie score and
it’s halftime."
193,Ross," Okay, first of all, I don’t play with cheaters, and second of all,
you know I had swollen glands!!"
194,Monica, Y'know what? I’ll think you’ll play.
195,Ross, Oh really! Why is that?
197,Monica, Because the winner gets this!
198,Ross, The Geller Cup.
199,Chandler, Is everybody else seeing a troll doll nailed to a two by four?
201,Chandler," Okay, good."
204,Ross," Okay, where in the hell did you get that?!"
205,Monica," When Mom and Dad drove you to the hospital to get your nose fixed, I
swam into the lake and fished it out."
206,Ross, That cup is mine!
207,Monica," No it’s not! You want it, you’re gonna have to win it!"
208,Rachel," All right, so are we not having dinner at all?"
209,Monica," Come on Phoebe, let’s go! Come on, it’s time to get serious,
huddle up. Joey, keep your head in the game."
210,Joey," It’s hard, y'know, his huddle is closer to Dutch girl."
211,Monica," All right look, if I take Chandler out of the running will you be able
to focus?"
212,Joey, What are you gonna do?
213,Monica," All right, you just make sure that Chandler catches the ball, I’ll
take care of the rest."
214,Joey, Okay.
215,Monica, Break!
216,Joey, Here you go!
218,Ross, Chandler! Chandler!
220,Chandler, (to Margha) Hi.
222,Monica," Whoa! Whoa!! Tackled by a girl! Bet ya don’t see that everyday, do
ya?"
223,Ross, Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What’s with the tackling?
224,Monica, What?! I just touched him and he went over.
225,Ross," Okay, you wanna play rough, we can play rough."
233,Phoebe, I love this game!!
235,Ross," Hey, where’d you get that?"
236,Rachel, I went really long.
237,Monica," Forty-two to twenty-one! Like the turkey, Ross is done!"
238,Ross," It’s no surprise that your winning, ‘cause you got to pick
first, so you got the better team."
239,Monica," You’re so pathetic! Why can’t you just accept it, we’re
winning because I’m better than you."
241,Monica," Oh, what a great argument, exhaling! All right, y'know what, I’ll
prove it to you, okay. I’ll trade you Joey for Rachel, and I’ll still win the
game."
242,Ross," What?! The guys against the girls? See, that’s ridiculous Monica,
because I’m only down by three touchdowns."
243,Monica," Oh, then bring it on! Oh, unless of course your afraid you might lose to
a bunch of girls."
244,Ross," Fine, fine, Rachel your with Monica, Joey you’re with me."
245,Rachel, I can not believe your trading me!!
246,Monica," Come on Rach, come on. Let’s see what’s it like to be on a
winning team for a change."
247,Rachel, Are you gonna let me play?
248,Monica, All right then.
251,Chandler," No-no-no-no, the game’s not over, we’re just switching
teams."
252,Joey," Yeah, Chandler finds me so intimdating that it’s better if we’re
on the same team."
253,Ross," Right. Okay, let’s play. Let’s go."
254,Chandler," No ah, hold on a second Joe, where do Dutch people come from?"
255,Joey," Ah well, the ah, Pennsylvania Dutch, come from Pennsylvania."
256,Chandler," And the other ah, Dutch people, they come on from somewhere near the
Netherlands, right?"
257,Joey," Nice try. (to Margha) See the Netherlands is this make believe place where
Peter Pan and Tinker Bell come from."
259,Ross," Enough with geography for the insane, okay? Let’s play some ball,
guys."
260,Joey," Whoa, whoa, no, no, I-I’m not playing with this guy, now."
261,Chandler, Fine with me.
262,Ross," Okay, y'know what, let’s just cut to the chase here. Okay? Heidi,
which of my boys do you like?"
265,Ross," Yeah, y'know for dating, general merriment, taking back to your
windmill..."
267,Chandler, Yes!!
268,Joey," Wait a minute! Wait a minute! She obviously didn’t understand the
question."
269,Chandler," Well, you don’t you have Captain Hook explain it to her."
271,Chandler," You hear that! That is her chose, mister I’ll let you have her! I
win! You suck! I rule all! A mini-wave in celebration of me!! (does the wave.)"
273,Chandler, Wh-what?
275,Joey, Nice going. You just saved yourself a couple months of sex.
276,Chandler," Y'know what, it doesn’t matter, ‘cause she picked me. Me!
From now on I get the dates and you have to stay home on Saturday nights watching Ready,
Set, Cook!"
277,Ross," Save the breakthroughs for therapy, okay. The clock is ticking. We have no
time, and we are losing, we are losing to girls."
278,Chandler, We’re not gonna lose to girls.
279,Ross, Hey! It’s 42-21!
280,Joey," This sucks, I was just up by that much!"
281,Monica, Are we playing football or what? Come on you hairy-backed Marries.
283,Monica," We have to do this. We are playing for women everywhere. Okay, just
think about every lousy date that you ever had, okay, every guy who kept on the TV while
you’re making out..."
284,Phoebe, Oh my God! You dated someone with a glass eye too?!
285,Monica," Come on, okay, come on this is for all womankind. Let’s kill
‘um!"
286,Rachel, Yeah!!! Kill ‘um!!!
287,Phoebe," All right, no, well I want to kill them to, but their boys, y'know how
are we gonna beat three boys?"
293,Monica," All right, we still have a minute and a half to go, and we’re down
by two points. Two points.... (she gets interrupted by the guys, who are doing a
slow-motion high five.) Phoebe you do a button-hook again. Rachel, you go long."
294,Rachel, No! Come on! Don’t make me go long. Use me. They never cover me.
295,Monica," Honey, there’s a reason."
296,Rachel," God, I’m not lame, okay. I can do something. I can throw, would you
let me throw, come on this is my game too."
297,Phoebe," Come on Mon, let her throw the ball."
298,Monica," All right Rachel, you sweep behind, I’ll pitch it to you, you throw
it down field to Phoebe. All right. Break."
299,Rachel, Thank you! Break!
300,Monica, Thirty-two! Seventy-one! Hike!
304,Rachel, I’m so sorry! Are you okay?
305,Monica, No! I’m not okay!
306,Rachel," I’m sorry, they were just all coming at me, and I didn’t know
what to do."
307,Joey, (looking at the timer) Thirty seconds left on the timer!
308,Chandler," Okay, okay, so we get to take that stupid troll thing home!"
309,Monica, Come on! Come on! Hurry! We’re running out of time! Huddle up!
310,Phoebe," Okay. Oooh! Oh, this is our last huddle, yeah."
311,Monica," All right, Phoebe get open. Rachel, go long."
312,Rachel, (on the verge of tears) Okay.
313,Monica, Break!
315,Rachel, (in triumph) I got a touchdown! We did it!!
316,Chandler," Hey-hey-hey Rachel, funny thing. Actually, the ah, end zone starts at
that pole, so you’re five feet short, so we win!"
317,Phoebe," Wait-wait-wait-wait! So, explain something to me though, if, if nobody
tagged Rachel, then isn’t the play still going."
319,Ross, Let go! Let go!
320,Monica, Let go! I’m a tiny little woman!!
321,Chandler," Guys! Guys! Come on! It’s Thanksgiving, it’s not important
who wins or loses. The important thing is, (to Joey) the Dutch girl picked me! Me! Not
you! Holland loves Chandler! Thank you, Amsterdam! Good night!!"
322,Monica, Ow!!
325,Rachel," We should defiantly play football more often. Maybe there’s a like
league we could join or something."
326,Phoebe, Isn’t there a national football league.
327,Chandler," Yes. Yes, there is, they play on Sundays and Monday nights."
328,Rachel, Oh shoot! I work Monday nights.
329,Phoebe," Umm, this stuffing is amazing. Do you think we should bring them some?"
330,Joey," When they’re hungry enough, they’ll come in."
332,Monica, Let go!
333,Ross, No! You let go!
334,Monica, No!
335,Ross, How come it’s always us left in the field holding the ball?
336,Monica, I don’t know. I guess the other people just don’t care enough.
338,Ross, Hey! It’s starting to snow.
340,Ross, Gimme the this!
341,Monica, Let go!
0,Chandler," (reading the comics) Eh..., I don’t, I don’t know."
1,Rachel, What?
2,Chandler," Well, as old as he is in dog years, do you think Snoopy should still
be allowed to fly this thing?"
4,Rachel, Yeah.
6,Rachel," Oh, sure! Do you need me to train somebody new?"
8,Rachel," (to Chandler) Eh, do you believe that?"
9,Chandler, (thinks about it) Yeah?
13,Ross," Just admit it Chandler, you have no backhand."
14,Chandler," Excuse me little one, I have a very solid backhand."
15,Ross, Shielding your face and shrieking like a girl... is not a backhand.
16,Chandler, I was shrieking... like a Marine.
18,Ross," All right here. Watch me execute the three ‘P’s of championship
play. Power. (swings the racquet) Precision. (swings the racquet.) and penache. (does a
backswing and hits Sarah who’s started up the stairs, knocking her down, they both
watch in horror.)"
20,Monica, You broke a little girl’s leg?!!
21,Ross, I know. I feel horrible. Okay.
22,Chandler," (reading the paper) Says here that a muppet got whacked on Seasame
Street last night. (to Ross) Where exactly were around ten-ish?"
23,Ross," Well, I’m gonna go see her. I want to bring her something, what do
you think she’ll like?"
24,Monica," Maybe a Hello Kitty doll, the ability to walk..."
26,Rachel, I’m gonna get back to retraining. (gets up)
27,Ross," All right, see you guys. (starts to leave)"
28,Chandler," Look out kids, he’s coming! (Ross continues to leave with his
head down in shame.)"
29,Joey, And I gotta go sell some Christmas trees.
30,Phoebe," Have fun. Oh wait, no, don’t! I forgot I am totally against that
now."
31,Joey, What? Me having a job?
32,Phoebe," No, no, I am against innocent trees being cut down in their prime, and
their, their corpses grotesquely dressed in like tinsel and twinkly lights. (to Joey) Hey,
how do you sleep at night?"
33,Joey," Well, I’m pretty tired from lugging the trees around all day. Hey,
Phoebe listen, you got this all wrong. Those trees were born to be Christmas trees, their
fulfilling their life purpose, by, by making people happy."
34,Phoebe, Really?
36,Chandler," Yes. Yes, and ah, ah, the trees are happy too, because for most of
them, it’s the only chance to see New York."
39,Rachel," Gunther, Gunther, please, I’ve worked here for two and a half
years, I know the empty trays go over there. (points to the counter.)"
41,Rachel," Huh. Well, y'know that’s actually a really good idea, because that
way they’ll be closer to the mugs. Y'know what, you should have the other waitresses
do that too."
43,Rachel," Gee, I always heard them talk about that, I just always thought that it
was a club they went to. Oh God, I’m, I’m sorry. (walks away)"
46,Ross," So, this must be kinda neat for ya, huh? I mean, your Dad tells me that
you get a couple of days off school, and you, you ah, don’t have to sell those
cookies anymore. "
48,Ross," Wow, you ah, you really like all this space stuff, huh?"
50,Ross," I think you would have to clean a whole lot of apartments to go all the
way to India."
52,Ross," Huh. Well, good luck to Dad. Say, how many more boxes would you have to
sell in order to win?"
54,Ross, Yeah.
56,Ross," Four hundred, huh? Well, that sounds do-able. (starts to get out his
wallet) How much are the boxes?"
58,Ross, (puts away his wallet) And what is second prize?
60,Ross," Well, that makes sense."
62,Ross," Yeah, Sarah, anything."
66,Ross," Hi, I’m selling Brown Bird cookies."
68,Ross," No, hi, I’m, I’m an honorary Brown Bird (does the Brown Bird
salute.)"
70,Ross," Ah, well, it means that I can sell cookies, but I’m not invited to
sleep-overs."
72,Ross," No, please, please, um, it’s for a poor little girl who wants to go
to Spacecamp more than anything in the world."
74,Ross," Okay, okay! I’m going. I’m going. (goes across the hall to knock
on another door.)"
76,Ross, All right!!
78,Phoebe, (walking up to Joey) Hey.
79,Joey," Hey. What, what are you doing here?"
80,Phoebe," Well, I-I thought a lot about what you said, and um, I realilized duh,
all right maybe I was a little judgmental. Yeah, (looks at the tree) oh, but oh..."
81,Joey," Look now, Phoebe remember, hey, their just fulfilling their Christmas...."
82,Phoebe, Destiny.
83,Joey, Sure.
84,Phoebe, Yes.
85,Joey, All right.
86,Phoebe," Okay. (One of Joey’s co-workers, walks by with a dead tree.) Yikes!
That one doesn’t look very fulfilled."
87,Joey," Oh, that’s, that’s ah, one of the old ones, he’s just
taking it to the back."
88,Phoebe," You keep the old ones in the back, that is so ageist."
89,Joey, Well we have to make room for the fresh ones.
90,Phoebe," So, what happens to the old guys?"
91,Joey," Well, they go into the chipper."
92,Phoebe," Why, do I have a feeling that’s not as happy as it sounds? (Joey
points out one going into the chipper to her, as this haunty, demonic music starts to play
in the background) No! Nooooo!!! (she winces in horror and hides her face against
Joey’s shoulder, as she sees the tree spit out from the chipper.)"
93,Joey," (to the guy operating the chipper) Hey! Hey!! (makes the ‘cut
it’ motion with his hands)"
95,Ross," ...and these come in the shapes of your favourite Christmas characters,
Santa, Rudolph, and Baby Jesus."
96,Joey," All right, I’ll take a box of the cream filled Jesus’s."
97,Ross," Wait a minute, one box! Come on, I’m trying to send a little girl to
Spacecamp, I’m putting you down for five boxes. Chandler, what about you?"
98,Chandler," Ahh, do you have any coconut flavoured deities?"
99,Ross," No, but ah, there’s coconut in the Hanukkah Menoreoes. I tell you
what, I’ll put you down for eight boxes, one for each night."
101,Ross, Mon?
102,Monica," All right, I’ll take one box of the mint treasures, just one, and
that’s it. I-I started gaining weight after I joined the Brown Birds. (to Ross)
Remember, how Dad bought all my boxes and I ate them all?"
103,Ross," Ah, no Mon, Dad had to buy everyone of your boxes because
you ate them all. But ah, y'know I’m sure that’s not gonna happen this time, why
don’t I put you down for three of the mint treasures and just a couple of the
Rudolph’s."
104,Monica, No.
105,Ross," Oh, come on, now you know you want ‘em."
106,Monica," Don’t, don’t, don’t, don’t, don’t do this."
107,Ross," I’ll tell you what Mon, I’ll give you the first box for free."
108,Monica, (she reaches out for it and stops) Oh God! I gotta go! (runs out)
109,Ross, Come on! All the cool kids are eating ‘em! (chases after her.)
112,Rachel," (sitting down next to Chandler) I’m training to be better at a job
that I hate, my life officially sucks."
113,Joey," Look Rach, wasn’t this supposed to a temporary thing? I thought you
wanted to do fashion stuff?"
114,Rachel," Well, yeah! I’m still pursuing that."
115,Chandler," How... exactly are you pursuing that? Y'know other than sending out
resumes like what, two years ago?"
116,Rachel," Well, I’m also sending out.... good thoughts."
117,Joey," If you ask me, as long as you got this job, you’ve got nothing
pushing you to get another one. You need the fear."
118,Rachel, The fear?
119,Chandler," He’s right, if you quit this job, you then have motivation to go
after a job you really want."
120,Rachel," Well then how come you’re still at a job that you hate, I mean why
don’t you quit and get ‘the fear’?"
122,Chandler," Because, I’m too afraid."
123,Rachel," I don’t know, I mean I would give anything to work for a designer,
y'know, or a buyer.... Oh, I just don’t want to be 30 and still work here."
124,Chandler," Yeah, that’d be much worse than being 28, and still
working here."
126,Rachel, Yeah.
128,Rachel, Can’t I just look at the handles on them?
130,Rachel," Okay, fine. Gunther, y'know what, I am a terrible waitress, do you know
why I’m a terrible waitress? Because, I don’t care. I don’t care. I
don’t care which pot is regular and which pot is decaf, I don’t care where the
tray spot is, I just don’t care, this is not what I want to do. So I don’t think
I should do it anymore. I’m gonna give you my weeks notice."
132,Rachel," Gunther, I quit."
133,Chandler," (to Joey) Does this mean we’re gonna have to start paying for
coffee? (Joey shrugs his shoulders.)"
136,Ross," ....and 12, 22, 18, four... (Chandler starts laughing) What?"
137,Chandler, I spelled out boobies.
138,Monica," (comes up and starts looking through Ross’s cookie supply) Ross,
but me down for another box of the mint treasures, okay. Where, where are the mint
treasures?"
139,Ross," Ah, we’re out. I sold them all."
140,Monica, What?
141,Ross," Monica, I’m cutting you off."
142,Monica," No. No, just, just, just a couple more boxes. It-it-it’s no big
deal, all right, I’m-I’m cool. You gotta help me out with a couple more boxes!"
143,Ross," Mon, look at yourself. You have cookie on your neck."
144,Monica, (covers her neck) Oh God! (runs to the bathroom)
145,Chandler," So, how many have you sold so far?"
146,Ross, Check this out. Five hundred and seventeen boxes!
147,Chandler," Oh my God, how did you do that?"
148,Ross," Okay, the other night I was leaving the museum just as ‘Laser
Floyd’ was letting out of the planetarium, without even trying I sold 50 boxes!
That’s when it occurred to me, the key to my success, ‘the munchies.’ So I
ah, started hitting the NYU dorms around midnight. I am selling cookies by the case. They
call me 'Cookie Dude!'"
149,Rachel," (entering) Okay, stop what you’re doing, I need envelope stuffers,
I need stamp lickers....."
150,Ross," Well hey, who did these resumes for ya?"
151,Chandler, Me! On my computer.
152,Ross, Well you sure used a large font.
153,Chandler," Eh, yeah, well ah, waitress at a coffee shop and cheer squad
co-captain only took up so much room."
154,Rachel," Hey-hey-hey that’s funny! Your funny Chandler! Your a funny guy!
You wanna know what else is really funny?!"
155,Chandler, Something else I might have said?
156,Rachel," I don’t know, I don’t know, weren’t you the guy that told
me to quit my job when I had absolutely nothing else to do. Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!!"
157,Ross," Sweetie, calm down, it’s gonna be okay."
158,Rachel," No, it’s not gonna be okay Ross, tomorrow is my last day, and I
don’t have a lead. Okay, y'know what, I’m just gonna, I’m just gonna call
Gunther and I’m gonna tell him, I’m not quitting."
159,Chandler, You-you-you don’t wanna give into the fear.
160,Rachel," You and your stupid fear. I hate your fear. I would like to take you and
your fear.... "
161,Joey," (entering, interrupting Rachel) Hey! I got great news!"
162,Chandler," Run, Joey! Run for your life! (runs out)"
163,Joey," What? Rachel, listen, have you ever heard of Fortunata Fashions?"
164,Rachel, No.
165,Joey," Well my old man is doing a plumbing job down there and he heard they have
an opening. So, you want me to see if I can get you an interview?"
166,Rachel," Oh my God! Yes, I would love that, oh, that is soo sweet, Joey."
167,Joey, Not a problem.
168,Rachel, Thanks.
169,Joey, And now for the great news.
170,Ross," What, that wasn’t the great news?"
171,Joey," Only if you think it’s better than this... (holds up an aerosol can)
snow-in-a-can!! I got it at work. Mon, you want me to decorate the window, give it a kind
of Christmas lookie."
172,Monica, Christmas cookie?
174,Joey," Okay, and ah, this one here is a Douglas Fir, now it’s a little more
money, but you get a nicer smell."
176,Phoebe," (running up carrying a tree) Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! No, no, you
don’t want that one. No, you can have this cool brown one. (points to the almost dead
tree she has)"
178,Phoebe," Okay but that’s why you have to buy it, so it can fulfil it’s
Christmas destiny, otherwise there gonna throw it into the chipper. Tell him, Joey"
179,Joey," Yeah, the ah, trees that don’t fulfil their Christmas destiny are
thrown in the chipper."
181,Joey," Pheebs, you gotta stop this, I working on commission here."
182,Monica," (entering) Hey, guys. I’m here to pick out my Christmas tree."
183,Phoebe," Well look no further, (shows her the dead one) this one’s yours!
Ahhh."
184,Monica, Is this the one that I threw out last year?
185,Phoebe," All right y'know what, nevermind! Everyone wants to have a green one!
I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to get so emotional, I guess it’s
just the holidays, it’s hard."
186,Monica," Oh honey, is that ‘cause your Mom died around Christmas?"
187,Phoebe," Oh, I wasn’t even thinking about that."
188,Monica," Oh. (turns and looks at Joey, who gives a ‘way-to-go’ thumbs
up and smile.)"
190,Ross," (to the girl sitting next to him) Hi there. How many, how many ah, did you
sell?"
192,Ross," Hey now! That was an accident, okay."
194,Ross, What’s a scrud?
196,Ross, I don’t have too. I can just look at you.
198,Ross, (to himself) Not nice enough.
200,Ross, (to himself) Good for a scrud.
202,Ross," That’s crap!! Sister Brown Bird. (to Elizabeth) Good going. (does the
salute)"
204,Ross, Hi there!
206,Ross," Um, that is because my doctor says that I have a very serious....
nuget.... diffency."
208,Chandler," Tell us what happened, Brown Bird Ross."
209,Ross," Well, I lost. Some little girl loaned her uniform to her nineteen year old
sister, who went down to the U.S.S. Nimitz, and sold over 2,000 boxes."
210,Chandler," (to Rachel, who’s entering) Hey! How’d the interview go?"
211,Rachel," Oh, I blew it. I wouldn’t of even hired me."
212,Ross," Oh, come here sweetie, listen, you’re gonna go on like a thousand
interviews before you get a job. (she glares at him) That’s not how that was supposed
to come out."
213,Phoebe, This is the worst Christmas ever.
214,Chandler," Y'know what Rach, maybe you should just, y'know stay here at the
coffee house."
215,Rachel," I can’t! It’s too late! Terry already hired that girl over
there. (points to her) Look at her, she’s even got waitress experience. Last night
she was teaching everybody how to make napkin.... (starts to cry) swans."
216,Ross, That word was swans.
218,Chandler," Well seeing that drunk Santa wet himself, really perked up my
Christmas."
220,Phoebe, Oh! Oh my God!
222,Phoebe," You saved them! You guys! Oh God, you’re the best!"
223,Chandler, It’s like ‘Night of the Living Dead Christmas Trees.’
225,Rachel," (answering the phone) Hello? (listens) Yeah, this is she. (listens) Oh!
You’re kidding! You’re kidding! (listens) Oh thank you! I love you!"
226,Chandler," Sure, everybody loves a kidder."
227,Rachel, (hanging up the phone) I got the job!
229,Phoebe," Oh, God bless us, everyone."
231,Rachel," Here we go. I’m serving my last cup of coffee. (the gang starts
humming the graduation theme) There you go. (hands it to Chandler) Enjoy. (they all cheer)"
232,Chandler, (to Ross) Should I tell her I ordered tea?
233,Ross, No. 
234,Rachel," Um, excuse me, everyone. Ah, this is my last night working here, and I
ah, just wanted say that I made some really good friends working here, and ah, it’s
just time to move on. (at the counter Gunther starts to cry and runs into the back room)
Ah, and no offence to everybody who ah, still works here, you have no idea how good it
feels to say that as of this moment I will never have to make coffee again."
239,Ross," I’m, I’m sorry you didn’t get to go to Spacecamp, and
I’m hoping that maybe somehow, this may make up for it. Presenting Sarah
Tuttle’s Private Very Special Spacecamp!! (opens the door and Chandler and Joey jump
up, their apartment is decorated like outer space, one of the leather chairs is covered in
tinfoil.)"
241,Ross," Oh come on! Here we go! (picks her up and puts her in the chair) Stand by
for mission countdown!"
242,Joey," (simulating an echo) Ten, ten.., nine, nine, nine....,
eight, eight, eight... (Chandler hits him in the back of the head) Okay, Blast off!"
244,Chandler, I’m an alien. I’m an alien.
245,Ross," Oh no! An asteroid! (throws the soccer ball off the back of Joey’s
head.)"
0,Joey," Okay, pick a card, any card. (Monica picks one) All right, now memorize
it. Show to everybody. Got it?"
1,Monica, Um-mm.
2,Joey," All right, give it back to me. (takes the card back, but he looks at the
card before he puts it back in the deck, he holds the deck to his forehead, and thinks a
little while) 5 of hearts."
4,Ross, Real magic does exist.
5,Rachel, Wow.
6,Monica," Wow. Joey, (sarcastically) how do you do it?"
7,Joey," I can’t tell you that, no."
9,Ross," Ah, somebody’s at the door on the ceiling."
10,Rachel," Noo, that’s our unbelievably loud upstairs neighbor."
11,Monica," He took up the carpet, and now you can hear everything."
12,Phoebe," Why don’t you go up there and ask him to ‘step lightly,
please?’"
13,Monica," I have like five times, but the guy is so charming, that I go up there
to yell and then I end up apologizing to him."
14,Phoebe," Ooh, that is silly. (gets up) I’ll go up there, I’ll tell him
to keep it down."
15,Monica," All right, be my guest."
16,Rachel, Good luck.
18,Joey," All right, all right, all right, all right, all right, you really wanna
know how I did it, I’ll show ya. When you handed me back the card, what you
didn’t see was, I looked at it so fast that it was invisible to the naked eye. (picks
up a card and quickly looks at it) I just did it. (does it again) I just did it, again.
Here, I’ll slow it down so that you guys can see it. (looks and the card in slow
motion)"
21,Phoebe," (muffled through the floor) Yeah, look I was with my friend downstairs
and we hear everything up here that you do, and I am sick and tired... (I tired but the
rest is unintelligible)."
23,Phoebe," (muffled) Oh, thank you."
26,Chandler," (entering) Hey, anybody got a length of rope about six feet long with
a little nouse at the end?"
27,Monica," Honey, what’s the matter?"
28,Chandler, I just saw Janice. 
30,Chandler," Yeah, she was at Rockefeller Center skating with her husband, she
looked so happy. I almost feel bad for whipping that kid’s pretzel at them."
31,Joey," Man, I remember the first time I saw that girl Katherine, after we broke
up. She was just walking with her friend Donna, just laughing and talking. God, it killed
me."
32,Chandler," Yes, but you ended up having sex with both of them that afternoon."
33,Joey," Sorry, I just, any excuse to tell that story y'know...."
34,Ross," Hey Chandler, there’s a party tomorrow, you’ll feel better then."
35,Chandler," Oh, y'know what, I’m gonna be okay, you don’t have to throw
a party for me."
36,Monica, It’s Joey’s birthday.
37,Chandler," Oh, well then, if anybody should have a party it should be him."
39,Monica, Sush!! I cannot believe she is still up there.
41,Chandler," Okay, well he totally screwed up the punch line. Y'know, it’s
supposed to be arrghh-eh og-errigh."
44,Rachel," (jumping up from reading her magazine) Yeah, right away Mr. Kaplan."
46,Rachel, I know!
48,Rachel, Op.
50,Rachel," Oh, you got me."
52,Rachel," Oh, that sounds great."
54,Rachel," Oh thank you so much Mr. Kaplan, thank you so much."
57,Rachel," Oh God, I hate my job, I hate it, I hate my job, I hate it."
58,Monica," I know honey, I’m sorry."
59,Rachel," Oh, I wanna quit, but then I think I should stick it out, then I think
why would such a person stay in such a demeaning job, just because it’s remotely
related to the field they’re interested in."
60,Monica," (gives her a look) Gee, I don’t know Rach. Order up!! I got a
Yentel soup, a James Beans, and a Howdy hold the Dowdy!"
61,Rachel," Oh honey, come on, I’m sorry, I didn’t.... I don’t mind
paying my dues, y'know, its just how much am I gonna learn about fashion by walking Mira,
the arthritic seamstress, to the bathroom."
63,Rachel, (to him) Hi! Is my misery amusing to you?
65,Rachel," It’s not funny, this is actually my job."
67,Rachel," Oh well then, so I’m just going to go back to talking to my friend
here. And you can go back to enjoying your little hamburger."
69,Rachel, Yes?!
71,Rachel, (looks at Monica) (to him) Do you want my pickle?
74,Monica," Hey Gunther. Hi. (to Phoebe) I mean you’re going out on a date with
the noisy guy upstairs?"
75,Phoebe," Well, he’s very charming."
76,Monica," I know, he’s too charming, but if you two start going out, then
it’s just gonna make it so much harder for me to hate him."
77,Phoebe," Well, you’re just gonna have to try."
78,Monica," Joey, where are the Jell-o shots?"
79,Joey," I don’t know, Chandler is supposed to be passin’ ‘em
around..."
81,Joey, Chandler!
82,Chandler, Hello-dillillio!!
83,Ross," Oh, somebody’s feeling better."
84,Monica, (to Chandler) Stick out your tongue.
85,Chandler, (to Monica) Take off your shirt!
87,Monica, Oh my!!
88,Joey, Oh my God! How many of these things did you have? These are pure vodka.
89,Chandler," Yeah, Jell-o just like Mom used to make."
90,Rachel," (entering, to Ross) The most unbelievable thing happened to me today."
91,Ross, Hi!
92,Rachel," Hi! So I’m out having lunch at Monica’s and this guy starts
talking to me, and it turns out he works for a buyer at Bloomingdale’s and
there happens to be an opening in his department. So I gave him my phone number and
he’s gonna call me this weekend to see if he can get me an interview!"
93,Ross, Wow!
94,Rachel, I know!
95,Ross," What, so this guy is helping you for no apparent reason?"
96,Rachel, Uh-huh!
97,Ross," And he’s, he’s a total stranger?"
98,Rachel," Yeah! His name is um, Mark something."
99,Ross, Huh. Sounds like Mark Something wants to have some sex.
100,Rachel, What!?
101,Ross," Well, I’m just saying, I mean why else would he just, y'know, swoop
in out of nowhere for no reason."
102,Rachel, To be nice.
103,Ross," Hey, Joey. Are men ever nice to strange women for no reason?"
104,Joey," No, only for sex."
105,Ross," Thank you. (to Rachel) So did you ah, did you tell Mark Something about
me?"
106,Rachel," I didn’t have to, because I was wearing my ‘I heart Ross’
sandwich board and ringing my bell."
107,Ross, Uh-huh.
109,Joey, Hey!! Hey-hey-hey!
110,Chandler," (to Monica) Okay, how many of that girl are you seeing?"
111,Monica," How hammered are you? Huh? These, these are Joey’s sisters."
112,Chandler, Hi Joey’s sisters!
113,Phoebe," (to one of his sisters, Cookie) Hey!"
115,Phoebe," Well, I have ah, vodka and cranberry juice."
117,Phoebe," Wow. Okay, I don’t know how to talk to you."
120,Chandler," Oh, I’m taking my ex-girlfriend of my speed dialer."
122,Chandler," No-no-no-no, no, it’s a good thing. Why must we dial so speedily
anyway? Why must we rush through life? Why can’t we savor the precious moments? (to
one of Joey’s sisters) Those are some huge breasts you have."
124,Ross, Hi.
125,Monica, Hi.
126,Ross," Yeah. So um, I-I heard about this ah, Mark guy that ah, Rachel met today."
127,Monica, Isn’t that great?
128,Ross," Oh yeah! So ah, kinda pretty, pretty good. He sounds like a nice, good
guy."
129,Monica," Oh, he is. And he is so dreamy. I mean, y'know what, when he left I
actually used the phrase, ‘Hummina-hummina-hummina.’ (walks away)"
130,Ross, That’s excellent.
132,Ross," (to Rachel) So, he’s just a nice guy. You really think this Mark
doesn’t want anything in exchange for helping him?"
133,Rachel," Well, I assume I’ll have to take showers with him, but y'know,
that’s true of any job."
135,Monica, How ya feelin’?
136,Chandler," Well, my apartment isn’t there anymore, because I drank it."
137,Phoebe," Where’d you get too? We lost you after you opened up all the
presents."
138,Ross, Yeah.
139,Chandler," Yeah, I ended up in the storage room, and not alone."
141,Chandler," Ow, no ‘woo-hooing,’ no ‘woo-hooing.’ "
142,Phoebe," Why, what happened?"
143,Chandler," Ah, I fooled around with Joey’s sister. (Phoebe gasps) Well,
that’s not the worst part. "
144,Monica, What is the worse part?
145,Chandler, I can’t remember which sister.
146,Ross," (to Rachel) You see what men do! Don’t tell me men are not nice!
(points to Chandler) This is men!!"
149,Monica," Are you insane? I mean Joey, is going to kill you, he’s actually
going to kill you dead."
150,Chandler, Okay! You don’t think I thought of that?
151,Phoebe, How can you not know which one?
152,Rachel, I mean that’s unbelievable.
153,Monica," I mean, was it Gina?"
154,Ross, Which one is Gina?
155,Rachel," Dark, big hair, with the airplane earrings."
156,Monica," No, no, no, that’s Dina."
157,Chandler," (to Monica) You see you can’t tell which one is which either,
dwha!!"
158,Phoebe, We didn’t fool around with any of them. Dwha! Dwha!
159,Chandler," Veronica. Look, it’s got to be Veronica, the girl in the red
skirt. I definitely stuck my tongue down her throat."
160,Monica, That was me.
161,Chandler," Look, when I’ve been drinking, sometimes I tend to get overly
friendly, and I’m sorry."
162,Monica, That’s okay.
163,Rachel, That’s all right.
164,Ross, That’s okay.
165,Joey," (angrily entering, to Chandler) Can I talk to you for a second?!"
166,Ross," Hey, Joey."
167,Rachel, Hey. (they all walk away from Chandler)
168,Joey, Come on!! (motions for Chandler to come with him)
169,Chandler," Why can’t we talk in here? With, with, witnesses."
170,Joey, I just got off the phone with my sister.
171,Ross," Ah, which, which one?"
172,Joey, Mary-Angela.
173,Ross, Mary-Angela.
174,Joey, Yeah.
175,Monica, Y'know which one was she again?
176,Joey," Why don’t you ask Chandler, ‘cause he’s the one that fooled
around with her. She told me you said you could really fall for her. Now is that
true? Or are you just gettin’ over Janice by groping my sister. "
177,Chandler, It’s gotta be the first one.
178,Joey," Really? That’s great! You and my sister, sittin’ in a tree."
179,Chandler," Yep, I’m in a tree."
181,Rachel, Did he call? Did Mark call?
182,Monica," No honey, I’m sorry, but the weekend’s not over yet."
183,Rachel," Oh. (we hear laughing from the upstairs apartment) Oh my God, is that
Phoebe?"
184,Monica, I guess they’re back from their date.
186,Rachel, Music. Very nice.
188,Monica, Oh my God!
189,Rachel," So, how are you?"
190,Monica, I am good. I finished my book.
192,Rachel," Oh yeah, what’s it about?"
193,Monica, I don’t remember. Do you wanna take a walk?
194,Rachel," Yeah, I do. (they both run out)"
196,Ross," Dear Mary-Angela. Hi. How’s it going. This is the hardest letter
I’ve ever had to write. (to Chandler) What the hell’s a matter with you? How do
you think Joey’s going to react when he finds out that you blew off his sister with a
letter?"
197,Chandler," Well, that’s the part where you tell him that I moved to France.
When actually I’ll be in Cuba."
198,Ross," All right, look, look, you’ve got to do this yourself, okay in
person. At least you know her name. You just go to the house and you ask for Mary-Angela,
okay, when which ever one she is comes to the door, you take her for a walk, you let her
down easy."
199,Chandler, What if Mary-Angela comes to the door and I ask for Mary-Angela?
200,Ross, Where in Cuba?
202,Chandler," (shocked) Joey, what-wh-wh-wha-wh-wha-wh-wha-wh-wha-what are you doing
here?"
203,Joey, Waiting for my Grandma to finish my laundry. What about you?
204,Chandler, I’m here to see Mary-Angela.
205,Joey," You are so the man! (motions him to come in, and he does) Now look,
listen, listen, you got to be cool, ‘cause my Grandma doesn’t know about you two
yet, and you do not want to tick her off. She was like the sixth person to spit on
Mussolini's hanging body. Yeah."
206,Chandler, Where’s Mary-Angela?
207,Joey, She’s right in there. (motions to the living room)
211,Rachel," I can’t believe Mark didn’t call. It’s Sunday night, and
he didn’t call."
212,Ross, Bummer.
213,Rachel," (to Ross) Yeah, right. Look at you, you’re practically giddy."
214,Ross," No, I’m genuinely sorry the Mark thing didn’t work out. Look,
Rach, I want only good things for you."
215,Monica," Wait a minute, why don’t you just call Mark. (they both look up in
shock) I mean, who says you have to sit here and wait for him, you’ve got to make
stuff happen."
216,Ross," But, you, you don’t want to seem too pushy."
217,Monica," (to Ross) Honey, it’s not pushy, he gave her his home number."
218,Ross," (to Rachel, as she gets his number) What, he gave you his home number? As
in like, to, to his home?"
219,Rachel," Yeah, and you don’t mind if I call, because you only want good
things for me."
220,Ross," That’s right good things, that-that is what I said. (glances at
Monica)"
221,Rachel," (on phone) Hello, Mark? Hi, it’s Rachel Green. (listens) Oh no,
don’t you apologize. (listens) Yeah, I’ll hold. (to Monica and Ross) He left my
number at work, but he was helping his niece with her report on the pioneers."
222,Ross, That is so made up!
223,Rachel," (on phone) Yeah, oh my God, tomorrow! That, no, it’s perfect. Oh
God, thank you soo much. Great! Bye! (hangs up phone) I got the interview!"
224,Monica, Yay!
225,Ross, There you go.
226,Rachel, He even offered to meet me for lunch tomorrow to prep me for it.
227,Monica," Oh, that is amazing!"
228,Ross," Yeah well, if I know Mark, and I think I do, I’d expect nothing less."
229,Rachel, I got to figure out what I’m going to wear.
230,Ross, High collar and baggy pants say I’m a pro.
231,Rachel," Yeah! Right! Okay, I’ll see you guys later. (starts to leave) Woo
hoo!"
232,Ross," You go get ‘em. (to Monica) What did I do to you? Did I hurt you in
some way?"
233,Monica, What?
234,Ross," ‘Why don’t you call him?!’ Well, thank you very much!
Y'know now he is going to prep her, y'know prep her, as in what you do when you surgically
remove the boyfriend!"
235,Monica, Are you crazy?!
236,Ross," Am I! Am I! Am I out of my mind! Am I losing my senses!! This dreamy guy
is taking my girlfriend out for a meal."
237,Monica," What?! Ross y'know this isn’t even about you! I mean this is about
Rachel and something wonderful happening for her. I mean you know even if you’re
right, what if he wants to sleep with her, does it mean he gets too?"
238,Ross, No.
239,Monica, I mean don’t you trust her?
240,Ross," Well, yeah!"
241,Monica, Then get over yourself! Grow up!
242,Ross, (shyly) You grow up.
244,Chandler," This teramisu is, is excellent. Did you make it Mary-Angela?"
246,Chandler," Well, it’s, it’s yummy. So Mary-Angela do you like it?"
248,Chandler," So um, Mary-Angela, what’s your second favorite?"
250,Chandler," Would you just please....give me the receipt ‘cause this is
great. It’s top notch."
252,Chandler, So will I.
254,Chandler, Oh no-no-no I was just squinting. That doesn’t mean anything.
256,Chandler, Will you excuse me I have to um..... (walks to the hall)
258,Chandler, (startled) Hey!
260,Chandler," Look, I may have jumped the gun here. (she tries to kiss him, but he
ducks it and moves away) Um, I just got out of a relationship and I’m not really in
a, in a commitment kind of place."
262,Chandler," Ahhhh, you’re not Mary-Angela."
264,Chandler," This is so bad. If-if you’re not Mary-Angela, then-then who is?"
266,Chandler," Oh, this is soo bad. (doesn’t see Mary-Angela)"
268,Chandler, No Joey! No Joey! Don’t Joey! Joey!
269,Joey, What’s goin’ on?
270,Chandler, (pats him on the shoulder) You’re it! Now run and hide!
272,Joey," What?! How could you do that, how could you think she was Mary-Angela?"
273,Chandler," I wasn’t sure which one Mary-Angela was. (all of Joey’s
sisters gasp) Look, I’m sorry okay, I was really drunk, and you all look really
similar."
276,Chandler," Y'know what, we should all calm down because your brother’s not
going to punch me. (to Joey) Are ya?"
277,Joey," Well, that is usually what I would do. But I just never thought you’d
be on the receiving end of it. How could you do this?!"
278,Chandler," Joey if you wanna punch me, go ahead, I deserve it. But I just want
you to know that I would never soberly hurt you or your family, you’re my best
friend. I would never do anything like this ever again."
281,Joey," No! No! No! No, I’m not going to punch Chandler."
283,Joey," No you won’t. Look he knows he did a terrible thing and I believe
him, he’s sorry. But, (to Chandler) you’ve got one more apology to make, all
right, you’ve got to apologize to Mary-Angela."
284,Chandler," Okay, absolutely!"
285,Joey, All right.
286,Chandler," You’ve got it. (he starts to look at his sister’s, but he
still doesn’t know which one is Mary-Angela.)"
287,Joey," Cookie, now you can punch him!"
288,Chandler, What?! (Cookie punches him)
290,Rachel, (getting of the elevator and noticing Ross) Hey!
291,Ross, Hi!
292,Rachel, What are you doing here?
293,Ross," Ah y'know, this building is on my paper route so I... (gives her a flower)
"
294,Rachel, Oh.
295,Ross, Hi. (kisses her)
296,Rachel, Hi.
297,Ross, How’d did it go?
298,Rachel," Oh well, the woman I interviewed with was pretty tough, but y'know thank
God Mark coached me, because once I started talking about the fall line, she got all happy
and wouldn’t shut up."
299,Ross, I’m so proud of you.
300,Rachel, Me too!
301,Ross," Listen, I’m ah, I’m sorry I’ve been so crazy and jealous
and, it’s just that I like you a lot, so..."
302,Rachel, I know.
303,Ross, Yeah.
304,Rachel, Yeah.
306,Rachel, Yeah. (turns around) Hi Mark!
308,Rachel," Oh, I did!"
310,Rachel," (to Ross) Oh my God!! (she turns around and hugs Mark, not Ross)"
311,Ross, Congratu!! (sees her hug Mark) -lations-lations.
314,Monica," So ah, Phoebe, how was your date?"
315,Phoebe, Oh well y'know. (laughs)
316,Monica," Yeah, I do know."
317,Phoebe," Ick, you were eavesdropping."
318,Rachel," Eavesdropping. Pheebs, the ceiling tiles were falling down."
319,Phoebe," Oh, I’m sorry. But I really like this guy. And I think he really
happens to like me."
321,Ross, Maybe he’s just jumping on a pogo-stick and really likes it?
323,Ross, Maybe the pogo-stick likes it too?
324,Joey," All right, that’s it! He cannot do this to Phoebe. (gets up) This guy
is going to get the butt kicking of a lifetime! (stops and turns around and asks Rachel)
But, is he a big guy?"
325,Ross," Ah, we’ll all go. (motions to Chandler) Come on. (the guys leave)"
326,Phoebe, Thanks you guys! Thank you.
327,Chandler, Don’t worry.
328,Phoebe," God, I hope they kick his ass!"
329,Rachel," Honey, I’m sorry."
330,Monica," Y'know if it’s any consolation, he really did sound like he was
having more fun with you. (Rachel nods in agreement)"
0,Rachel," (running in from her bedroom, wearing only a towel) Okay. Hey. Umm. Does
everybody hate these shoes? "
1,Chandler," Oh yeah, but don't worry. I don't think anybody's gonna focus on that
as long as your wearing that towel dress. "
2,Rachel, (to Ross) Tell him. 
3,Ross," (to Chandler) It's her first day at this new job. Your not supposed to
start with her! "
4,Chandler," All right, I suppose I can wait a day. Hey, what are you doing Friday?
"
5,Ross, Why? 
6,Chandler," I need you to come to this bachelor party for my weird cousin Albert,
y'know he's the botanist. "
7,Ross," Oh God. Y'know, botanists are such geeks. "
8,Chandler, Yeah. Is that a dinosaur tie? 
9,Ross," Hmm? Oh, yeah. (he makes a growling sound) "
10,Phoebe," (entering, with about 20 purses hanging around her neck) Morning. Rach,
I'm here with the purses! "
11,Chandler, (to Phoebe) It must take you forever to find your keys. 
12,Rachel," (running into the living room) Thank you, thank you, thank you, Pheebs. "
13,Phoebe," Your welcome, oh please not the one with the turtles. "
14,Rachel," No, no, no, no turtles scare me. I don't need that today. "
15,Ross," Honey, just relax, it's gonna be fine. Hey, umm,. why don't I come down
there and I'll take you out to lunch? "
16,Rachel," Oh honey, thank you, but Mark's taking me out. "
17,Ross," Mark is that ah, the same Mark that helped you get the job? "
18,Rachel," Yeah, it's kinda like a 'good luck on your first day' sort of thing. (to
Phoebe) Is this actually a lunchbox? "
19,Phoebe," Umm, no, it's a purse. And there's a thermos in it. "
20,Rachel, Oh. 
21,Chandler," (to Ross) Hey, so can you make it on Friday? "
22,Ross," What? Oh yeah, yeah I think so. Why am I invited to this again? "
23,Chandler," Well apparently Albert has no friends. He's very excited about the
bachelor party though. I think actually the only reason he's getting married is so he can
see a stripper. "
24,Phoebe," A stripper at a bachelor party, that is so cliché. Why don't you get a
magician?! "
25,Chandler," Well, if the magician can open my beer with his but cheeks, then all
right. "
28,Ross," She's having lunch with him. She's having lunch with him. And you should
of seen the hug she gave him when she got the job. And, and, and, (to Joey) he's really
good looking. (Joey gives an enthusiastic thumbs up) What am I gonna do? "
29,Chandler," Don't do anything. Keep it inside. Learn how to hide your feelings!
(pause) Don't cry outloud. "
30,Joey," (hanging up the phone) Yes! Guess who's in an audition for a Broadway
musical? "
31,Chandler," I want to say you but, that seems like such an easy answer. "
32,Joey," It is me! It's a musical version of Tale of Two Cities. So I think
I'm gonna sing New York, New York, and ah, oh I left My Heart in San Francisco.
"
33,Ross," Ah Joey, I don't think you get to pick the cities. "
34,Joey, What? 
35,Ross, Mr. Dickens gets to pick 'em. 
36,Joey, Who? 
37,Chandler, I'll get you the Cliff Notes. 
38,Joey, The what? 
39,Chandler, The abridgment. 
40,Joey," Oh, okay. (to Ross) The what? "
43,Rachel, Yeah. What kind of discount do we get? 
45,Rachel, Oh!! I love this job! (her phone rings) Wow! My first call. 
47,Ross," (on phone) Hi, is Rachel there? "
49,Ross, This is Ross? 
51,Ross, Of Ross and Rachel. 
53,Ross," Oh hey, hey Mark. "
55,Ross, Okay. 
56,Rachel, Hi honey! 
57,Ross," Hi! What's ah, what's Mark doing answering your phone? "
58,Rachel," Oh, he's just goofing around. "
59,Ross," Ohhhhh yeah, that's, that's funny. Why ah, why isn't he goofing around in
his own office? "
60,Rachel," Oh honey, this is his office too. I told you we're Joanna's two
assistants. "
61,Ross," Why does Joanna need two assistants, how, how lazy is she? "
62,Rachel, Oh! Oh my God! What did I just do? 
63,Ross, What? 
64,Rachel," I think I just shipped 3,000 bras to personnel. Oh honey, I gotta go.
(to Mark) Mark, I need you! "
65,Ross," Okay, bye-bye. (starts slamming the receiver down in anger.) "
66,Rachel, Ow! Ross!! 
67,Ross," Oh, oh, I'm, I'm, I'm sorry sweetie, I was just trying to ah, I'm dialing
another number. (hangs up) "
70,Monica," Please, I'm not going for anything. "
72,Monica, Would you please go? 
76,Monica," Look Julio, someone left their book here. "
78,Monica," Oh yeah, what are you reading? "
80,Monica," Have I read it? (pause) No, are you enjoying it? "
82,Monica," Your a poet and don't know it. (she turns away and makes a face like 'I
can't believe I just said that.') "
84,Monica," Oh, then you do know it. (pause) So um what kind of things do you write
about? "
86,Monica, Mine? (points to her lower lip) Right here? 
88,Monica," How would that go? (they kiss) Well, it didn't rhyme, but I liked it. "
90,Joey," (singing) You've got to pick a pocket or two. Boyyyyssss, (picks a
handkerchief from the pianist's pocket) you've got to pick a pocket or two.......... "
92,Joey, Really? Thanks. 
94,Joey," Excellent, I'll be there. "
96,Joey," Ahhh! My ah, my agent said it wasn't a dancing part. "
99,Chandler," ....three years of modern dance with Twila Tharp! Five years with the
American Ballet Theater?! "
100,Joey," Hey, everybody lies on their resume, okay. I wasn't one of the Zoom Kids
either. "
101,Phoebe," Well, can you dance at all? "
102,Joey," Yeah, I can dance, y'know. (starts to dance really, really, really badly) "
103,Chandler," Oh no, no, no, no. "
104,Phoebe," (covering her mouth in shock) What, what is that? "
105,Joey," Sure, it looks stupid now, there's no music playing. "
107,Chandler," All right, I have to get that, but no-no. (answering phone) Hello?
(listens) (happily) Hi! Yeah listen, I'm, I'm in need of a stripper and I was told that
you do that. (listens) Let me ask you this, what, what do you do for the extra hundred?
(listens) So would I, would I have to provide the grapes? "
108,Monica, (entering) Hi! 
109,Phoebe," Oh, how was last night with Julio, senorita? "
110,Monica," It was soo amazing, he is so sexy, and smart, which makes him even
sexier. Oh gosh, I gotta so you this. Last night, we were fooling around and he stops to
write a poem. "
111,Joey, Get out! I couldn't stop if a meteor hit me. 
112,Chandler," Okay, we have our stripper. A miss Crystal Chandelier. "
113,Joey," Well sure, you name a kid that, what do you expect them to grow up to be? "
114,Monica," Anyway um, when he left he forgot to take the poem with him. Now, I am
like totally dense about poetry, but I think it's pretty good all right. Check it out.
(hands them the poem) "
115,Joey, (reading) The Empty Vase. Translucent beauty... 
116,Chandler," To yourself. (finishing) Hey-hey-hey, y'know what that's pretty good. "
117,Monica," Oh good, I think so too. Pheebs? "
118,Phoebe, Oh yeah. 
119,Monica," Oh, I'm so glad you guys like it. Yay! All right I gotta go to work.
(tries to take the poem) "
120,Joey," Whoa, I'm not done. "
121,Monica," All right, just give it back to me when your done. See you guys. "
122,Chandler, Bye-bye. 
124,Phoebe," Oh my God, oh my God! Poor Monica! "
125,Chandler," What, what, what?! "
126,Phoebe," What?! He was with her when he wrote this poem. Look, (reading) 'My
vessel so empty with nothing inside. Now that I've touched you, you seem emptier still.'
He thinks Monica is empty, she is the empty vase! "
127,Chandler, You really think that is what he meant? 
128,Phoebe," Oh, totally. Oh, God, oh, she seemed so happy too. "
129,Joey, Done. 
132,Rachel," Oh, yeah, sure, it's umm... (she picks up this bug and it starts to play
the theme from Love Story) "
134,Ross," It's from Ross, it's a love bug. "
136,Rachel," Oh no, no-no-no, that's not, not, not, what he is doing. He's just, he's
just really romantic. "
138,Rachel, Yes. 
147,Ross," I'm hurt! I'm actually hurt, that you would think that I would send you
any of those things out of any thing other than love. Hurt! Hurt! "
148,Rachel, All right Ross!! I get it!! 
149,Ross, I mean my God... 
150,Rachel, You're hurt! 
151,Ross," ...can't, can't a guy send a barbershop quartet to his girlfriend's office
anymorrrrre!! "
152,Rachel," Oh, please, Ross it was so obvious! It was like you were marking your
territory. I mean you might have well have just come in and peed all around my desk! "
153,Ross, I would never do that! 
154,Rachel," Look, I know what's going on here, okay, Mark explained it all to me. He
said this is what you guys do. "
155,Ross," Yeah well if, if, if Mark said that, than Mark's an idiot. "
157,Joey, Mark's a genius! 
158,Ross, Why?! How?! How is he a genius? 
159,Chandler," Look, don't you see what's happening here. Instead of hitting on her
right away, he's becoming her confidant. Now he's gonna be the guy she goes too to
complain about you. "
160,Ross, What am I going to do? 
161,Chandler," Well, why don't you send her a musical bug, op, no you already did
that. All right look, you're going to have to go there yourself now, okay, make a few
surprise visits. "
162,Ross, I don't know you guys. 
163,Chandler," All right fine, don't do anything, just sit here and talk to us,
meanwhile she is talking to him about you. And he's being Mr. Joe Sensitive, and she
starts thinking 'Maybe this is the guy for me, because he understands me.' "
164,Joey," And before you know it, she's with him. And you'll be all, 'Ohh, man!' And
he'll be all, 'Yes!' And us, we'll be like, 'Wh-whoa, dude.' And pretty soon you'll be
like, (sadly) 'Hhiii,' and, and, and, 'I can't go, Rachel and Mark might be there.' And
we'll be like, 'Man get over it, it's been four years!!' "
165,Chandler, He paints quite a picture doesn't he? 
174,Rachel, Ohhh! That is soo sweet! (gets up to get herself a cup of coffee) 
178,Ross," All right that's, that's it!! Get off her! "
180,Ross, What's going on?! (throws the love bug at him) That's what's going on!! 
181,Rachel, (now standing behind Ross) Ross! 
183,Ross," I have been down in your store for twenty minutes trying to get a tie!
What do I have to do to get some service?! (turns to Rachel) Hi Rach. (He's puts his hand
on her shoulder and she knocks it away.) "
186,Joey," So, does that mean the audition is off? "
188,Joey, What?! 
190,Joey," It's ah, step-ity, step and jazz hands. "
192,Joey, Bye. (does the jazz hands) 
194,Phoebe, (entering) Hey! 
195,Monica, Hey. 
196,Phoebe, What are you wrapping? 
197,Monica," Oh-ho, look what I got Julio. "
198,Phoebe," Yeah, it's a vase. "
199,Monica," Yeah, just like the one in the poem. "
200,Phoebe, Well not exactly like the one in the poem. 
201,Monica, What do you mean? 
202,Phoebe," Remember how you said you were really dense about poetry? Oh. (hugs her)
"
204,Monica," (to Julio) So! I'm just an empty vase, huh? "
206,Monica," Y'know, so I don't read as many important books as you do, and I don't
write trick poems that seem to be about one thing but are actually about something else.
And y'know what, I get excited about stupid stuff, like when I my People magazine
comes on Saturday, and the new Hold Everything catalog. Y'know but that does not
mean that I'm empty, I care about things. I care about my friends and family. You have no
right to make that kind of judgment about me. "
208,Monica, You don't even know me... 
210,Monica, What? 
212,Monica," I'm sorry, my friend Phoebe... "
214,Monica, (sarcastically) Oh yeah. 
219,Joey," I know, it was the best I could get out of them. "
221,Joey," People, people, people. "
225,Rachel," So ah, did you have fun at the bachelor party last night? "
226,Chandler," Oh yeah, yeah! Look what I got, look what I got. (holds up a pen) See,
she's fully dressed, right? "
227,Rachel, Right. 
228,Chandler," And then you click it and, uh-oh, she's naked. And then, and then you
click it again and she's dressed. She's a business woman, she's walking down the street,
she's window shopping, and (clicks pen) whoa-whoa-whoa, sh-she's naked! (Rachel just
stares at him.) "
229,Ross, (entering) Hi. 
230,Rachel, Hello. 
231,Chandler," Y'know what, I'm, I'm gonna spend some alone time with the pen. "
232,Ross," (sits down next to her) I'm sorry, I was an idiot. "
233,Rachel, A big idiot. 
234,Ross," A big idiot. Just you have to realize is, this whole Mark thing is kinda
hard for me. "
236,Rachel," Honey, why is it hard, I mean we've been together for almost a year now?
"
237,Ross," Well, I was with Carol for like eight years and I lost her. And now if
it's possible I think I love you even more. So, it's hard for me to believe that I'm not
gonna, well that someone else is not going to take you away. "
239,Rachel," Honey, that's very sweet, it just seems to me though, that if two people
love each other and trust each other, like we do, there's no reason to be jealous. (she
kisses him) "
240,Ross, I gotta get going. Bye Chandler. 
241,Chandler," Oh, okay Ross. Listen, this pen is kinda getting boring, so can you
pick me up some porn? "
242,Rachel, Where ya going? 
243,Ross," Oh, I've got to go pick up Ben, we've got a play date this afternoon. "
244,Rachel," Ohh, with who? "
245,Ross," Oh, just this woman that I met last night at the party. "
246,Rachel, There was a woman at the... (realizes) The stripper?! 
247,Ross, Yeah. 
248,Rachel, You have a play date with a stripper?! 
249,Chandler," Man, I gotta get a kid. (looks at the pen and starts laughing) "
250,Ross," Ah, yeah, yeah. Umm, we started talking after she y'know, did her thing.
And it turns out she's got a boy about Ben's age, so we're taking them to a gym-boree
class. Why, is that okay? "
251,Rachel," Sure, is she married? "
252,Ross," Ahh, no. "
253,Rachel, Oh. (starts shaking the sugar down in a packet really hard.) 
254,Ross, Are you jealous? 
255,Rachel," Noo, I y'know I don't see why she has to play with you, that's all. I
mean doesn't she have any y'know other stripper moms friends of her own? "
256,Ross, You are totally jealous. 
257,Rachel," I'm not jealous. All right this is about, umm, people feeling certain
things y'know about strippers. And y'know, and um, I... "
258,Ross," Honey, I love you too. "
259,Rachel," Ugh. Wait, wait, wait. "
260,Ross, What? 
262,Ross, Huh. 
263,Rachel," (to Chandler) Well, there's a kiss that he won't forget for a couple of
hours, y'know. "
264,Chandler," Yeah. Either that, or you just turned him on and sent him off to a
stripper. "
0,Monica, (to clerk) Hi.
3,Monica, Six? I just had it for one night. It’s three.
5,Monica," Y'know in a weird way, you have too much power. Look, you’re gonna
have to help me out here, ‘cause I only have three."
7,Monica, Oh my God. Richard? (turns around) Hi!
9,Monica," Wow! Your lip went bald. (Richard pays the clerk) Hey, thanks."
11,Monica, Right.
13,Monica, What?
15,Monica," (removes them) That’s because I-I was just grabbing some things out
of the dryer, and it’s static cling. Or maybe it’s just that God knew I’d
be running into you and saw an opportunity."
17,Monica, It’s good to see you too.
21,Monica," You see that guy? He’s in classics now, but y'know as soon as we
leave he’s going straight to the porn."
23,Monica, Yeah.
25,Monica, Me too.
27,Monica," Oh, um, I don’t know if that’s a good idea."
29,Monica," No, I just I think that it’s too soon."
32,Chandler," Yeah, baby!"
33,Ross, What are you doing?
34,Chandler, Making chocolate milk. Do you want some?
35,Ross, No thanks. I’m 29.
36,Rachel," (looking at her watch) Oh my God, I gotta go to work!"
37,Ross," Oh sweetie, when do you think you’re going to get off tonight?"
38,Rachel, Oh I don’t know honey. It’s gonna be really late.
39,Ross," Oh come on, not again."
40,Rachel," I know. I’m sorry. Look, I’ll make a deal with you all right?
Okay?"
41,Ross, Hmm.
42,Rachel, For every night that you’re asleep before I get home from work...
43,Ross, Yeah.
44,Rachel, I will wake you up in a way that’s proved very popular in the past.
45,Ross," Now, if you need to stay late, I want to be supportive of that."
46,Rachel, Right.
47,Phoebe," (entering, holding a pair of Roller Blades) Hi."
49,Joey, (to Phoebe) Look at you. Since when do you roller blade?
50,Phoebe," Oh! Since tomorrow. I met this really cute guy in the park and he like
y'know, jogs, and blades, and swims, and so y'know we made a deal that’s he’s
going to teach me all sorts of jock stuff."
51,Ross, And what are you going to do for him?
52,Phoebe, I’m going to let him.
53,Ross, Okay.
54,Joey, Cool.
55,Monica, (entering from her bedroom) Morning.
57,Rachel, Somebody got in late last night.
58,Monica," Yeah well, I ran into Richard. "
60,Rachel, When did this happen?
61,Monica," Oh, um, around 802. We ah, talked for a little while, and then um, we
went out for an innocent burger."
62,Phoebe," Oh, there’s no such thing as an innocent burger."
63,Ross," So, are you gonna see him again?"
64,Monica, Tomorrow night.
65,Rachel," Monica, what are you doing?"
66,Chandler," Well, she spent the last six months getting over him, and now
she’s celebrating that by going on a date with him."
67,Monica," It’s not a date, okay. I’m just gonna teach him how to make
lasagne for some pot luck dinner he has."
68,Joey," Well, you might wanna make a little extra, y'know you’ll probably be
hungry after the sex."
69,Monica," We’re not gonna have sex! Okay, nothing’s changed here. He
still doesn’t want children and I still do, so that’s why we’re just gonna
be friends."
70,Ross, Naked friends.
72,Rachel, (entering) Hey.
73,Joey, Hey.
74,Rachel, Do you have any ice?
75,Joey," Check the freezer. If there’s none in there, then we’re probably
out. Are you just getting in from work? It’s late."
76,Rachel," Yeah, I know. I had the greatest day though, I got to sit in on the
meeting with the reps from Calvin Klien. I told my boss I liked this line of
lingerie, she ordered a ton of it. How was your day?"
77,Joey, I discovered I’m able to count all of my teeth using just my tongue.
78,Rachel," Hmm. (she opens the freezer) Umm, why do you have a copy of The
Shining in your freezer?"
79,Joey," Oh, I was reading it last night, and I got scared, so."
80,Rachel," But ah, you’re safe from it if it’s in the freezer?"
81,Joey," Well, safer. Y'know, I mean I never start reading The Shining,
without making sure we’ve got plenty of room in the freezer, y'know."
82,Rachel, How often do you read it?
83,Joey, Haven’t you ever read the same book over and over again?
84,Rachel," Well, umm, I guess I read Little Women more than once. But I mean
that’s a classic, what’s so great about The Shining?"
85,Joey," The question should be Rach, what is not so great about The
Shining. Okay? And the answer would be nothing. All right? This is like the scariest
book ever. I bet it’s way better than that classic of yours."
86,Rachel," Okay. Ah, well we’ll just see about that, okay. I will read The
Shining, (she tries to take the book away from him but he doesn’t want to let it
go) and you will read Little Women. "
87,Joey," All right, you got it."
88,Rachel, All right.
89,Joey, Okay.
90,Rachel, Okay.
91,Joey," Ah, now Rach, these ah, these little women."
92,Rachel, Yeah.
93,Joey," How little are they? I mean, are they like scary little?"
95,Phoebe," Um, Chandler, Ross, this is Robert."
96,Chandler," Oh, hey."
98,Ross, Hey.
99,Phoebe," (to Robert) You’ve have lipstick right here (points to her cheek).
That’s okay, it’s mine, we just kissed."
100,Ross, Oh.
101,Chandler," (to Robert) So ah, isn’t a bit cold out for shorts?"
103,Chandler," Right, right. Sometimes you guys just burst into flames."
105,Chandler," (standing up) I’m up! I’m up, I’ve gotten up now!
Anybody ah, want anything?"
106,Phoebe, I’ll have coffee.
108,Ross," Yeah, make that three."
109,Chandler," Okay Ross, why don’t you come with me?"
110,Ross," Okay. (goes over to the counter) (to Chandler) What ah, what is the matter
with you? What’s going on?"
111,Chandler, Robert’s coming out.
112,Ross," What, what do you mean, what? Is he gay?"
113,Chandler, No. He.....he’s coming out of his shorts.
114,Ross, What?!
115,Chandler, The man is showing brain.
116,Ross," Are you sure? (Chandler nods Yes!) Hold on. (walks over behind the couch)
I’m sorry you guys, that was a coffee and a...."
118,Ross, Okay.
120,Ross," No, no, that won’t be ah, that won’t be necessary (leans down
and looks up Robert’s shorts, seeing Robert’s package.) "
121,Chandler, (to Ross) Wellll?
122,Ross," Yeah, yeah, yeah!"
123,Chandler, What do we do? What do we do?
124,Ross," Well, I suppose we just try to not look directly at it."
125,Chandler, Like an eclipse.
129,Monica," You say ‘Thank you very much,’ and then you buy me something
pretty. Come on, we’re gonna put are hands in this bowl, and we’re gonna start
squishing the tomatoes."
132,Monica, You touch people’s eyeballs every day and this feels weird.
134,Monica, Oops.
136,Monica, Gotta keep squishing.
138,Monica, Okay.
141,Monica," Oh, gosh, you got some on your shirt. "
143,Monica," Hold on a second, just put a little club soda on it (does so) and it
should umm, be..... "
146,Monica," Umm, you’ve got some on your pants."
149,Joey, These little women. Wow!
150,Chandler," Your liking it, huh?"
151,Joey," Oh yeah! Amy just burned Jo’s manuscript. I don’t see how he
could ever forgive her."
152,Ross," Umm, Jo’s a girl, it’s short for Josephine."
153,Joey," But Jo’s got a crush on Laurie. (Ross nods his head) Oh. You mean
it’s like a girl-girl thing? ‘Cause that is the one thing missing from The
Shining."
154,Chandler," No, actually Laurie’s a boy."
155,Joey, No wonder Rachel had to read this so many times.
157,Phoebe, Hey!
158,Chandler, Hey.
159,Ross," Hey! How’d the ah, basketball go?"
160,Phoebe," Oh, okay, I learned how to shoot a lay-up, a foul shot, and a
twenty-three pointer."
161,Chandler, You mean a three pointer?
162,Phoebe," Oh, I get more because I’m dainty."
164,Phoebe," Yeah, in the back. You want a quarter?"
167,Joey," (noticing Chandler) What are you doing? (he pushes Chandler back to his
side of the couch) Get back over on your side of the... (sees Robert in all his glory)
Hello!! (to Robert) Hi, I’m Joey, we haven’t met."
170,Phoebe," What? (the guys keep laughing.) What? You guys, what is going on? You
not like Robert? (the guys keep laughing.) Why are you laughing?!"
171,Ross, Calm down. There’s no reason to get testy.
173,Phoebe, You guys!! Come on!
174,Chandler," I’m sorry, I’m sorry, it just seems that Robert isn’t
as concealed in the shorts area, as ah, one may have hoped."
175,Phoebe, What do you mean?
177,Phoebe, Hey.
178,Joey," Hey Robert, could you ah, ha, pass me those cookies?"
182,Monica," So, how’d the lasagne go over? (listens) Really?! Good. So you owe
me three pretty things. (listens) Yeah, I’ve been thinking a lot about you too.
(listens) I know. It’s hard this whole platonic thing. (listens) It’s a word!"
184,Monica," Yeah, I do think it’s better this way. (listens) Yeah, we’re
being smart. (gets up to answer the door) (listens) Yes, I’m sure.(she opens the door
and it’s Richard)"
186,Monica, I’ll call you back. (starts kissing him)
189,Monica, So we can be friends who sleep together.
191,Monica," Sounds smart and healthy to me. So um, just out of curiosity, um, do you
currently have any other racquetball buddies?"
193,Monica, Oh.
195,Monica, No! (pushes him) No! 
197,Monica," ‘Cause if you do that means you’d be cancelling it for me, and
we’re just friends."
201,Phoebe, Hey. Ooh! Don’t sit down! 
203,Phoebe," Yeah. And, first here’s a gift."
205,Chandler," Stretchy pants! Why, those are the greatest things in the world! If I
were you I would wear them every day, every day!"
207,Phoebe," That’s all right, that’s well, I figured.... (they start to
leave as Joey enters.)"
209,Joey, Hey! (starts to laugh.) How’s it going?
210,Ross, Good.
211,Joey," Hey, Rach, how you doing with The Shining?"
212,Rachel," Oh, Danny just went into room 217."
213,Joey," Oooh, the next part’s the best, when that dead lady in the bathtub..."
214,Rachel," Oh, no, meh-nah-nah-nah, come on you’re gonna ruin it!"
215,Joey," All right I’ll talk in code. (to Ross and Chandler) Remember when the
kid sees those two blanks in the hallway?"
216,Chandler," Hmmm, that’s very cool."
217,Joey," Oh, all blank, and no blank, make’s blank a blank blank. Oh no-no-no,
no, the end when Jack almost kills them all with that blank, but then at last second they
get away. Aww!"
218,Rachel, Joey! I can’t believe you just did that!
219,Chandler, I can’t believe she cracked your code!
220,Rachel," All right, okay, Laurie proposes to Jo, and she says no, even though
she’s still in love with him, and then he ends up marring Amy."
221,Joey," Hey! Mine was by accident! All right, the boiler explodes and destroys the
hotel, and kills the dad."
222,Rachel, Eh. Beth dies.
224,Joey," Beth, Beth dies?"
225,Rachel, Um-hmm.
226,Joey, Is that true? If I keep reading is Beth gonna die?
227,Chandler," No, Beth doesn’t die, she doesn’t die. Does she Rachel?"
228,Rachel, What?!
229,Ross," Joey’s asking if you’ve just ruined the first book he’s
ever loved that didn’t star Jack Nicholson?"
230,Rachel, No. She doesn’t die.
231,Joey, Then why would you say that?!
232,Rachel," Because, I wanted to hurt you."
235,Rachel, (gasps) Oh my....
238,Monica, Hi.
239,Rachel," (screams and grabs a potato masher to defend herself) Sorry. I’m
sorry."
240,Monica," You would not believe my day! I had to work two shifts, and then to top
it off, I lost one of my fake boobs, (opens her coat revealing a large burn mark over her
left breast.) in a grill fire."
242,Monica, What are you smiling at?
243,Rachel," I’m sorry, I was just thinking you’re day could still pick up."
244,Monica," Yeah, right."
247,Monica, I love this friend thing!
249,Phoebe," Listen, Robert’s gonna be here any second so, will one of you just
tell him?"
250,Ross, Oh.
251,Phoebe," Please, right now, no, every time I see him it’s like ‘Is it
on the lose?’ ‘Is it watching me?’"
252,Chandler," We can’t tell him, you can’t go up to a guy you barely know
and talk about his.... stuff."
253,Ross," He’s right, even if it’s to say something complementary. (He
stops and thinks about what he just said.)"
255,Phoebe, Hey.
257,Phoebe," No, I can spot you from here."
259,Phoebe," Okay, listen Robert..."
260,Ross," (to Chandler) Hey, don’t we have to..."
261,Chandler," Yeah, we got, um-hmm."
262,Phoebe," Umm, I think you’re really, really great..."
264,Phoebe," I-I-I-I-I don’t know, I don’t know what to say."
268,Monica, Ow!
271,Monica," Oh my God! Oh my God! (She frantically tries to clean up the bedroom as
Richard starts the tour.)"
282,Monica," (still hiding under the blankets) So um, who was she?"
284,Monica," (still hiding under the blankets) Did you like her? And I’m just
asking as a friend, because I am totally fine with this."
286,Monica," (gets up) Okay, y'know what, I’m not fine, I’m not. I mean how
can I be fine, hearing you come in with her, she wants to see your bedroom.... (pause)
Y'know what, what if we’re friends who don’t see other people?"
288,Monica," Why not?! I mean this has been the most amazing week. Would it be so
terrible? Even if we were friends who lived together. Or, maybe someday friends who stood
up in front of their other friends, and vowed to be friends forever."
290,Monica," That’s not true, you don’t have a moustache."
292,Monica," Y'know what, I’ve got to walk out of here right now, ‘cause
getting over you is the hardest thing that I have ever had to do. I don’t think I
could do it again."
295,Monica, How ‘bout one last game of racquetball?
297,Monica, Watch the thorns!
301,Rachel, What?
302,Joey," Beth is really, really sick."
303,Rachel, Awwww.
304,Joey," Jo’s there, but I don’t think there’s anything she could
do."
306,Rachel, Joey?
307,Joey, Yeah.
308,Rachel, Do you want to put the book in the freezer?
309,Joey, (nodding his head) Okay.
310,Rachel, Okay.
1,Joey, Wow! This girl is good.
2,Phoebe," Oh-ho yeah! A song with rhyming words. Oo, I never thought of that
before."
3,Chandler, I like her.
4,Phoebe," (to Chandler) Why? Because she can sing and play guitar and do both at
the same time?"
5,Chandler," Well, that’s pretty much all I’m looking for from these
people."
6,Monica, (to Phoebe) Look at you. All jealous.
7,Ross," Yeah Pheebs, come on, you two have completely different styles. Y'know,
she’s more..(shakes his shoulders, like he’s dancing) y'know, and you’re
more (sees the look from Phoebe and stops)"
9,Phoebe," Okay, see, see, everyone else is happy she’s done."
12,Phoebe," Oh no, one of those ‘look for the hidden meaning’ songs."
16,Phoebe," Hey Leslie, how’d you know I’d be here?"
18,Chandler," (to Ross) All right listen, I have to go to the bathroom, but if the
place with the big fish comes up again. I’d like know whether that’s several big
fish or just one big fish."
19,Joey," (to Leslie) So ah, Phoebe tells us you write jingles."
20,Phoebe, Actually I said she abandoned me to write jingles.
21,Joey," (to Leslie) Ah, anything we might of heard of?"
25,Phoebe," Hmm, bummer."
27,Phoebe, No. But thanks.
29,Phoebe, Okay. No. But thanks.
31,Joey," (to Phoebe) Wow, that was kinda brutal."
32,Phoebe," Well okay, let this be a lesson to all of you, all right. Once you, once
you betray me, I become like the ice woman, y’know. Very cold, hard, unyielding,
y'know nothing, nothing can penetrate this icy exterior. (to Monica) Can I have a
tissue, please?"
33,Monica," Yeah, sure."
36,Chandler," No. This is just part of a dare devil game that I play called
‘wait until the last moment before I burst and die.’"
38,Chandler," Jeez, man did you fall..(sees it’s a beautiful woman coming out
of the men’s room) Hi! So ah, did ya, did-did-did ya fall high?"
41,Chandler," (to Gunther) Y'know what Gunther, go ah, go ahead, I’m-I’m
talking to ah, (tries to get her to say her name). (to her) This is the part where you say
your name."
43,Chandler," Ginger. I’m talking to Ginger, so.... "
45,Chandler," Nope, nope, I’d just ah, I’d rather talk to you. (pause)
Yes, I do. Yes, I do have to go to the bathroom. (knocks on the door)"
48,Phoebe, Where’s Chandler?
49,Joey," Ah, he can’t make it, he said he had to his... (sees Ginger) Whoa-oh!
(hides behind the coat rack.)"
54,Joey," Phew, close one."
56,Ross, Hi.
57,Rachel," Hi, sweetie!"
58,Ross, Hello. 
60,Ross," Yeah, huh. "
61,Rachel, I’ve got some bad news.
62,Ross, What?
63,Rachel," I can get a quick bite to eat, but then I have to come back up here."
64,Ross," Come on sweetie! You’ve had to work late every night for the past two
weeks, what is it this time?"
66,Ross," (to Rachel) But work comes first! (to Mark) Oh hey, but that’s sad
about you though, what happened? Burn out? Burn all out, did ya?"
67,Rachel," Nooo, he’s leaving for a better job."
68,Ross," Oh well that’s great, so I guess this is ah, this is good bye then.
Huh? (picks a pad up off Rachel’s desk and tosses it into his box) Good bye."
70,Ross, Okay.
71,Rachel, Well we’re gonna miss you around here.
75,Rachel," Yeah, you bet."
78,Phoebe," Oh. (takes her beeper puts in a pot, covers it, and puts the pot in the
oven)"
79,Monica, Y'know those are a delicacy in India.
80,Phoebe," Yeah, that was Leslie calling again to see if we can get back together.
That’s the twentieth time today! And good luck Leslie!"
81,Monica," Wow, she must have hurt you pretty bad, huh?"
82,Phoebe," Well, yeah. Y'know, we were best friends, ever since we were little, our
Moms worked on the barge together."
83,Monica," Oh, you two must have been so cute running around on a barge."
84,Phoebe, You never run on a barge!
85,Joey, (entering) Hey.
87,Joey," Is ah, is Chandler around?"
88,Monica," No, umm, he met some girl at the coffee house."
89,Joey, Oooh.
90,Monica," Yeah, Ginger something."
91,Joey," Nooo. No, no, ah, are you sure it wasn’t something that sounded like
Ginger, like ah, Gingeer?"
92,Monica," No, it was Ginger. I remember, because when he told me, I said,
(singing) ‘the movie star.’"
93,Joey," Aww, man. That’s the girl I was hiding from. When she finds out
he’s my roommate, she’s gonna tell him what I did."
94,Monica," Well, what did you do?"
95,Joey," What, oh, oh, oh, no, no, I can’t, I can’t tell you that,
it’s like the most awful, horrible thing I’ve ever done my whole life."
96,Monica," Y'know what, don’t tell us. We’ll just wait until Chandler
gets home, (to Phoebe) because it’ll be more fun that way."
97,Joey," All right!! Okay, it was like four years ago. Okay, Ginger and I had gone
out a few times, and then this one weekend, we went up to her Dad’s cabin. Just me,
her, and her annoying little dog Pepper. Well that night, I cooked this really romantic
dinner...."
98,Monica, You gave her food poisoning!?
99,Joey," I wish. No. After dinner, me, her, and Pepper all fell asleep in front of
the fire. Well I woke up in the middle of the night and I saw that the fire was dying out.
So, I picked up a log and threw it on. Or, at least what I thought was a log."
100,Phoebe, Oh my God!! You threw Pepper on the fire!
101,Joey," I wish. See, I guess another thing I probably should’ve told you
about Ginger is that she kinda has a ah, artificial leg."
103,Monica," Oh my God! Joey, what did you do after you threw her leg on the fire?"
104,Joey, I ran!!
106,Chandler," Well, that’s the best kiss I’ve had with anyone I’ve
ever met in a men’s room."
108,Chandler," (sees her foot is in a slush puddle) Op, foot in a puddle, foot all in
a puddle."
110,Chandler," Yeah, we’re gonna have to get you out of those shoes."
112,Chandler," No, really you’re gonna freeze."
114,Chandler," You’re not, what do you, what do you got a bionic foot?"
117,Rachel, Funny book?
118,Ross," Hmmm. Oh, no, no, I just thinking about something funny I heard today.
Umm, Mark, Mark saying ‘I’ll see you Saturday.’"
119,Rachel," Yeah, at the lecture, I told you that last week, you said you
didn’t mind."
120,Ross," Oh, no, no, no, it’s-it’s not the lecture ah, I mind, umm...."
121,Rachel," Oh, please tell me it’s not because I’m going with Mark."
122,Ross," Oh, well..."
123,Rachel, Oh my God!!! Ross!!
124,Ross," Well, I’m sorry, but ah, look if you’re not working with him
anymore, why do you have to still do stuff with him?"
125,Rachel," Because, he’s my friend."
126,Ross," Okay, but do you really need another friend? I mean..."
127,Rachel," Okay, well if I stop playing with Joey and Chandler, can I play with
Mark?"
128,Ross, Is that funny? Am I supposed to be laughing?
129,Rachel," I don’t know, you thought ‘See you Saturday’ was funny.
Look honey, Mark is in fashion okay, I like having a friend that I can share this stuff
with. You guys would never want to go to a lecture with me."
130,Ross, Pa-haa!! I would love to go with you.
131,Rachel, Really!?
132,Ross," Yeah, hey I-I have clothes, I even pick them out. I mean for, for all you
know I could be a fashion..... monger."
133,Rachel," Okay. Honey, I would love for you to go with me. (Ross has a worried
look on his face) What?"
134,Ross," What should I wear, now I’m all nervous."
136,Monica, Y'know they say a watched pot never beeps.
137,Phoebe," It’s just y'know, been a couple of hours, and she hasn’t
called. Not that I even care, y'know."
138,Monica, Phoebe why don’t you just call her? You obviously want to.
139,Phoebe, You think you know me so well.
140,Monica," Well, don’t ‘cha wanna?"
141,Phoebe, Yeah.
142,Monica," Okay, well I do know you."
143,Phoebe, That’s what I said.
144,Monica, Well so?
145,Phoebe," I can’t. I can’t. She dumped me, I mean I totally trusted her
and then one day it was ‘Okay, bye Pheebs’ gone. Y'know what the saddest part
is, when we were playing together, that was like the most fun I’ve ever had in like
all my lives."
149,Phoebe, (singing) I stepped in something icky.
154,Ross," (to Rachel) I’m really glad we came. (Rachel smiles and rubs his arm)
You’re so pretty. I love you."
155,Rachel, Oh. (puts her hand over his mouth)
157,Phoebe," (singing) Smelly cat, smelly cat, what are they feeding you? Smelly cat,
smelly cat, it’s not your fault."
159,Phoebe," Oh, yeah!"
161,Phoebe," I..., a jingle? No, no-no-no, no."
163,Phoebe," Okay, well if I was in this for the money, I’d be a millionaire by
now, y'know. You just got to get out of that jingle head sweetie."
165,Phoebe," That’s okay. All right, I’m gonna play song that’s
really, really sad. It’s called Magician Box Mix Up. (she turns her guitar upside
down to play it.)"
170,Monica, (entering) Hi!
171,Chandler, Hey.
172,Monica," Oh, can I borrow this? (points to his milk) My milk’s gone bad."
173,Chandler," Oh, I hate that. I once had a thing of half and half, stole my car."
174,Monica," So umm, how was your date with Ginger?"
175,Chandler," Great. It was great. She’s ah, she’s great, great looking,
great personality, she’s greatness."
176,Monica," Sounds like she’s got the ah, whole package."
177,Chandler," Joey told you about the leg, huh?"
178,Monica, Uh-huh.
179,Chandler," Oh God, it freaked me out. Okay, I know it shouldn’t have, but it
did. I mean I like her, I don’t want to stop seeing her, but every so often it’s
like ‘Hey, y'know what, where’s your leg?’ I mean I’m the smallest
person in the world aren’t I? I’m the smallest person in the world."
180,Joey, (entering from his bedroom) Morning.
181,Chandler, (to Monica) Actually he’s the smallest person in the world.
182,Joey, (to Chandler) Heard about the leg burnin’ huh?
183,Chandler, It came up.
184,Joey," Listen, I ah, I know it’s a longshot. But, by any chance did she find
that funny?"
187,Ross, (entering) So I nodded off a little.
188,Rachel," Nodded off!! Ross you were snoring. My father’s boat didn’t
make that much noise when it hit rocks!"
189,Ross," Come on! Forty-five minutes! Forty-five minutes the man talked about
strappy backed dresses."
190,Rachel," Well okay, how about four hours in a freezing museum auditorium
listening to Professor Pitstains and he’s ‘Hey everybody! Remember that thing
that’s been dead for a gazillion years. Well there’s this little bone we
didn’t know it had!’"
191,Ross," First of all it’s Professor Pittain! And second of all, that little
bone, proved that, that particular dinosaur had wings, but didn’t fly."
192,Rachel," Okay, see now, what I just heard blah-blah-blah,
blah-blah-blah-blah-blah, blah-blah-blah, blah, blah."
193,Ross," Y'know what, 100 million people went to see a movie about what I do, I
wonder how many people would go see a movie called, Jurassic Parka."
194,Rachel," Oh, that is so..."
195,Ross," No-no-no, a bunch of out of control jackets take over an island. (Makes an
unusual sound, then he realises that he still has his jacket on and quickly tries to shake
it off, thinking it’s alive and attacking him.)"
196,Rachel," Y'know if what I do is so lame, then why did you insist on coming with
me this morning? Huh? Was it so I just wouldn’t go with Mark?"
197,Ross," No. I... I wanted to be with you. I don’t know, I feel like lately, I
feel like you’re slipping away from me, y'know. With this new job, and all these new
people, and you’ve got this whole other life going on. I-I-I know it’s dumb, but
I hate that I’m not a part of it."
198,Rachel," It’s not dumb. But, maybe it’s okay that you’re not a
part of it. Y'know what I mean? (Ross looks confused) I mean it’s like, I-I-I like
that you’re not involved in that part of my life."
199,Ross, That’s a little clearer.
200,Rachel," Honey see, it doesn’t mean that I don’t love you. Because I
do. I love you, I love you so much. But my work it’s-it’s for me y'know,
I’m out there, on my own, and I’m doing it and it’s scary but I love it,
because it’s mine. I, but, I mean is that okay?"
201,Ross," Sure, I-I-I... (hugs her and mouths No!!)"
204,Chandler," No. No. Actually I forgot, what is the deal with that again?"
206,Chandler, No. No. I don’t think so.
210,Chandler, That’s-that’s my nubbin.
212,Chandler," It’s kinda a ah, a third nipple kinda thing."
214,Chandler," Well, y'know two regulars. And ah one that barely qualifies as...
(starts to kiss her again, but she gets up.) Ahh, what?"
216,Chandler," You ah, you have, you have to leave, now? How come?"
219,Phoebe," (to Leslie) Oh, I thought you weren’t coming. What? Where were you?"
221,Phoebe," Okay, don’t give me a reason to get mad, okay"
223,Phoebe," No, look, I told you that I didn’t want you to try and sell it, and
you just, you big fat did it anyway. God, y'know what, I think five years ago I probably
would’ve done anything to play with you but, I can do it by myself. And if I
can’t trust you then just forget it. "
225,Phoebe," Okay y'know what you have to choose. All right, if-if the most important
thing on the planet to you is this cat poopy thing then, okay you can have Smelly Cat, but
we won’t be partners. So what’s it gonna be?"
229,Monica," Sorry, Pheebs."
230,Joey, Yeah. You okay?
231,Phoebe," Yeah. I actually am, yeah. Y'know life-life’s gonna had you all
kinds of stuff, y'know you learn your little lessons and hopefully you grow. Wanna hear a
new song?"
232,Joey, Yeah.
233,Monica, We’d love too.
234,Phoebe," Okay. (singing) ‘Jingle bitch screwed me over! Go to hell jingle
whore! Go to hell Go to hell. Go to hell-hell-hell.’ That’s all I have so far."
237,Chandler," (entering, happily) Well hello!"
238,Joey, Where have you been?
239,Chandler, The doctor.
240,Ross, Is everything okay?
241,Chandler," Oh yes! Just had me a little nubbin-ectomy. Yep! Two nipples, no
waiting."
242,Monica, Wow! It’s like Rachel in High School.
243,Rachel, What?!!
244,Monica," Come on! Come on, I was kidding! It was such an obvious joke!"
245,Chandler," That was an obvious joke, and I didn’t think of it.
Why didn’t I think of it? The source of all my powers. Oh dear God, what have I done!"
0,Joey," (to Monica) Hey, how much will you give me to eat this whole jar of
olives?"
1,Monica," I won’t give you anything, but you’ll owe me 2.95."
2,Joey, Done.
3,Phoebe, (entering) Hey. I need an atlas! I need an atlas!
4,Monica, Why? (in a motherlike tone) Do you have a report due?
5,Phoebe," I have a date with this diplomat I met while I was giving free massages
outside the UN and, I don’t know where his country is."
6,Monica," Okay, let’s start with the free messages outside the UN."
7,Phoebe," Oh!! That’s my new thing. I figure bodies at peace, make peace."
8,Monica," Wow! You might just get the first Nobel prize in rubbing. So what
country is this guy from?"
9,Phoebe, Ick-neck-tree-anis..... There’s a ‘g’ in there.
10,Monica, Where’s that?
11,Phoebe, In your atlas!
12,Monica, I don’t have an atlas.
13,Phoebe, Oh.
14,Monica," Oh, but wait I do have a globe."
15,Phoebe, Oh.
16,Monica, Hold on.
17,Joey, So Pheebs what’s this guy like?
18,Phoebe," Umm, well he’s very dashing, y'know, and umm, very, very
sophisticated, and he doesn’t speak any English, but according to his translator, he
totally gets me."
19,Monica," ‘Kay, here you go. (Hands her this tiny little globe.)"
20,Phoebe, What is this?
21,Monica," It’s a globe and, a pencil sharpener."
23,Chandler," (entering) Hey, does anybody need anything copied? I’m going down
to the Xerox place."
24,Monica," Oh, no thanks."
25,Chandler," Okay listen, just give me anything I can make two of."
26,Monica," Well, if you don’t have anything to copy, why are you going down
there?"
27,Joey," Yeah, are you just going down there to gawk at that hot girl with the
belly button ring again?"
28,Chandler, Yeah! You wanna come?
29,Joey, Yeah!
32,Chandler," Come on Chloe! Finish up with your customer first. Come on Chloe! Come
on Chloe!!"
34,Chandler, Uh-oh.
35,Joey," Uh, y'know what, we’re having second thoughts about our copying
needs. And we’ll need a little more time to think about it."
37,Chandler," (to Joey) Okay, that hurt us."
39,Chandler," Well ah, ........y'know."
41,Joey, Both of us? (points to Chandler and himself)
45,Joey, We’ll be there.
47,Chandler," All right, rock on. (Does the ‘Hang 10’ sign, then hides his
face in shame.)"
51,Phoebe," Me too. Although this city is my home, so. So that’s dumb what I
said, don’t tell him I said that. Umm, you make something up. (Mischa does so and
Sergei kisses her hand.) Nice, (to Mischa) thank you. This is me. Here."
54,Phoebe," (to Mischa) Thank you, very much! Oh! (to Sergei) Thank you!"
57,Phoebe," (to Mischa) Okay, y'know what, you don’t have to do that now.
(Mischa translates that to Sergei) No-no-no-no!! Not him, you don’t! (Mischa tells
Sergei he can proceed and steps away) Well the moment’s over."
59,Phoebe, Oh.
62,Phoebe, (pointing to the globe) See there it is right there.
63,Monica, Wow! It’s small.
64,Phoebe," Yeah. But Sergei said it took the Germans six weeks to get all the way
across it."
65,Monica," So you had fun, huh?"
66,Phoebe," Yeah. Except for, y'know when you’re on a date and you’re
getting along really great but the guy’s translator keeps getting in the way."
67,Monica, No.
68,Ross, (entering) Hey.
70,Ross," What is ah, Rach in her room?"
71,Monica," Oh no, she’s still at work, but she told me to tell you to call
her."
72,Ross," Oh what?! Is she gonna cancel on me again?! How can she do this?
Doesn’t she know it’s our anniversary?"
73,Monica," All right ah, Ross, this is the extent of my knowledge on the subject.
(holds up a notepad) Call Rachel."
74,Ross, What’s that on the bottom?
75,Monica," Oh that’s my doodle of a ladybug, with a top hat. (to Phoebe)
She’s fancy."
77,Rachel, (answering her phone at work) Hello.
78,Ross," Hey, honey."
79,Rachel," Oh, hi."
80,Ross," Hey, what’s going on?"
81,Rachel," Well, there was a disaster in shipping and I’ve got to get this
order in. Honey, I’m so sorry, but it looks like I’m gonna be here all night."
82,Ross," What, do you, well umm, oh how about I come up there?"
83,Rachel," No-no-no, no, honey please, I’ve got, I’ve just have so much
to deal with."
85,Phoebe," (to Monica) Anyway, I’m going out with Sergei again tonight, and
um, could you come and be the translator’s date? So that when we, it’s time for
our alone time, you two could split off. Y'know, he’s really, he’s kinda cute."
86,Monica," Yeah, well kinda cute, like really kinda cute, or kinda cute like your
friend Spackel Back Larry?"
87,Phoebe," Hey, don’t call him that! His name is Spackel Back Harry!"
89,Chandler," Hey, y'know what, maybe we should get going. I mean what time did
Chloe say we should be there?"
90,Joey," Uh, 1030."
91,Chandler, What time is it now?
92,Joey, 430.
93,Chandler," Yeah all right, so we’ll hang out."
94,Joey," Yeah. Hey, remember when she brought up that thing about the three of us?"
95,Chandler, Yes. Vividly.
96,Joey, She was kidding about that right?
97,Chandler," Yeah, I-I-I think so. (Pauses and thinks about it for a second) Yeah,
I-I think so..."
98,Joey," God, that would be weird it that situation presented itself tonight, huh?"
99,Chandler," Yeah. Yeah, I mean what, what would we do?"
100,Joey," Dude, I don’t know."
101,Chandler, She was kidding.
102,Joey, Yeah.
103,Chandler," She was.... But y'know what, just in case, maybe we should come up
with a set of ground rules."
104,Joey," Yeah, for sure. Okay. Probably want the first thing to be, never open your
eyes. Y'know, because you don’t want to be doing something and then look up and see
something you don’t want to be seeing."
105,Chandler," Yeah. Good call, nice one. Hold it!! Hold it! What if me eyes are
closed, and, and my hand is out there.... (holds his arm out and pretends to grab
something with his hand.)"
106,Joey," Ah!! Okay! Eyes open at all times! Oh, hey, how do we decide where we...
(clears throat) y'know each would, (clears throat again) y'know (pause) be?"
107,Chandler," Right. Right. Well ah, y'know we could flip for it."
108,Joey," Yeah, I guess, but what’s like heads and what’s tails?"
109,Chandler," Well it you don’t know that, then I don’t want to do this
with you."
111,Rachel," (on the phone) No, no, no, I’m looking at a purchase order right
here and it clearly states that we ordered the Rivera bikini in a variety of sizes and
colours. And.... (listens) What does it matter, what I’m wearing?! Can I please speak
to your supervisor? (listens) Thank you. (to Sophie) We’re holding."
112,Ross," (entering, carrying a basket) Hi!"
113,Rachel," (startled) Oh!! My God, what are you doing here?"
114,Ross," Well you said you couldn’t go out so.... (pulls the cover off of the
basket)"
116,Rachel," Ross honey, this is very nice, but, but I-I got a crisis."
117,Ross," Yeah, but I got cous-cous!"
118,Rachel," Honey, honey, I’m sorry, I know it’s our anniversary but I
told you on the phone I don’t have time to stop."
119,Ross," Okay, you don’t have to stop, I’m invisible, I’m not here.
(lights a candle)"
120,Rachel," But I don’t, hmm... (on phone) Oh, who approved that order?!
(listens) Well there is no Mark Robbinson in this office. (to Sophie) Get me Mark on the
phone!"
122,Ross, Yeah!!
123,Rachel," Well, let me just check that with what I got here, all right see 038 is
not the number for (Ross starts making a lot of noise with a handheld pepper grinder) this
store, 038 is Atlanta. And I...(stops and looks at Ross)"
124,Ross, (stopping grinding) Pepper?
125,Rachel, (angrily) None for me.
126,Ross," Okay sorry, whew."
127,Rachel," I’m sorry, as I was saying the store number is wrong, and I’m
sorry but that’s... (notices a fire that Ross’s candle has started) Oh my God!! "
128,Ross," (putting out the fire with a squeeze bottle of water) Okay, that’s a
fire. Oh yeah. Oh yeah."
129,Rachel," (on phone) Excuse me, I’m sorry, I’m gonna have to call you
back, I’ve got a Schemp in my office. (hangs up) (to Ross) What are you doing?"
130,Ross," I’m sorry. But ah, hey, oh, somebody’s off the phone, how
‘bout a glass of wine by the fire, I could get it going again."
131,Rachel," Ross you’re not listening to me, I don’t have time to stop."
132,Ross," Come on Rach, you don’t have what, ten minutes?"
133,Rachel, I don’t have ten minutes!!
134,Ross," What? (to Sophie) Sophie, does she have ten minutes?"
135,Rachel," Hey, Ross!!! I told you I don’t!"
136,Ross," Don’t yell at me okay, this is the most I’ve seen you all week."
137,Rachel," Look, I cannot do this right now, okay, I’ve got a deadline, would
you just go home, I’ll talk to you later. (storms out) "
138,Ross," Yeah, but wait..."
139,Rachel, Good bye!
143,Ross, Hey.
144,Rachel," Hi. Look um, about what happened earlier..."
145,Ross," No, hey, well, I-I completely understand. You were, you were stressed."
146,Rachel," (throws her stuff down) I was gonna give you a chance to apologise to
me."
147,Ross, For what? For letting you throw me out of your office?
148,Rachel," You had no right coming down to my office Ross. You do not bring
a picnic basket to somebody’s work! Unless maybe they were a park ranger!"
149,Ross," Yeah, well excuse me for wanting to be with my girlfriend on our
anniversary, boy what an ass am I. "
150,Rachel," But I told you, I didn’t have the time!"
151,Ross," Yeah, well you never have the time. I mean, I don’t feel like I even
have a girlfriend anymore, Rachel."
152,Rachel," Wh, Ross what do you want from me? You want me, you want me to quit my
job so you can feel like you have a girlfriend?"
153,Ross," No, but it’d be nice if you realised, it’s just a job!"
154,Rachel, Just a job!
155,Ross, Yes.
156,Rachel," Ross do you realise this is the first time in my life I’m doing
something I actually care about. This is the first time in my life I’m doing
something that I’m actually good at. I mean. if you don’t get that..."
157,Ross," No, hey, I get that, okay, I get that big time. And I’m happy for ya,
but I’m tired of having a relationship with your answering machine! Okay, I
don’t know what to do anymore."
158,Rachel, Well neither do I!
159,Ross, Is this about Mark?
160,Rachel, (shocked) Oh my God.
161,Ross," Okay, it’s not, it’s not."
162,Rachel," Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight over and over again,
Ross, no, you’re, you’re, you’re making this too hard."
163,Ross," Oh I’m, I’m making this too hard. Okay, what do you want me to
do."
164,Rachel," I don’t know, I don’t know. Urrrgh! Look, maybe we should take
a break."
165,Ross," Okay, okay, fine, you’re right. Let’s ah, let’s take a
break, (goes to the door) let’s cool off, okay, let’s get some frozen yogart, or
something.. (opens the door)"
166,Rachel, No. (Ross is standing in the doorway.) A break from us.
173,Ross," Oh, hi Chloe."
175,Chandler, And that’s the only colour that comes in.
178,Chandler," So, what are you doing here? I thought tonight was your big
anniversary dinner."
179,Ross," Yeah, little change in plans. Ahh, we’re gonna break-up instead."
182,Monica," Oh, and I can also speak a little French. Voulez-vous coucher avec moi
ce soir? (Mischa laughs) Why? What did I say?"
184,Monica, Oh my God! No wonder I get such great service at Cafe Maurice.
185,Phoebe," (laughing and banging her spoon on the table) Knock, knock, knock,
knock, hi. Um, could you please tell Sergei that um, I was fascinated by what Boutros
Boutros Gali said in the New York Times."
187,Phoebe, You didn’t say Boutros Boutros Gali.
191,Phoebe, Interesting.
193,Phoebe," Okay, ah, before you get all talky again, umm, could you also please
tell Sergei that I really like his suit."
196,Monica, I’m also thinking about opening up my own restaurant.
198,Phoebe," Monica, can I talk to you behind my menu, please. (Behind the menu) What
are you doing?"
199,Monica," Well, I was having a conversation."
200,Phoebe," Yeah but, Mischa is so interested in you, that Sergei and I haven’t
been able to say two words to each other."
201,Monica," What do you want me to do? Just sit here silently while you three have a
conversation?"
202,Phoebe, That would be great. Thank you.
204,Rachel, (jumping up to answer the phone) Hello!
206,Rachel, (disappointed) Oh.
208,Rachel," No! Sorry, I just thought you were somebody else. Hi!"
210,Rachel," Yeah. Well, umm....."
212,Rachel," (on the verge of tears) Yeah, I’m fine."
214,Rachel," No! Really, no, please, please, that’s, that’s okay."
216,Rachel," Oh, yeah, I’m not, I’m not hungry."
218,Rachel," Oh. Okay, bye."
220,Joey, So what are you gonna do?
221,Ross," What can I do? One person wants to break-up, you break-up."
222,Chandler," Hey, no way! Come on, this is you guys, call her and work it out."
223,Ross," Oh come on, we just had this huge fight, all right, don’t I have to
wait a while?"
224,Chandler," Hey, this isn’t like swimming after you eat, pick up the phone!!"
226,Chandler, Y'know that whole swimming thing is a myth.
227,Joey," Yeah, tell that to my Uncle Lenny."
228,Chandler, Why? What happened to him?
229,Joey," Nothing, he’s just really believes in that."
231,Rachel," Oh, and then, we got into this big, stupid fight. I just, it was awful.
I told him he treats me like a park ranger, or something, oh and then I told him I wanted
to take a break, I don’t want to take a break."
233,Rachel," No. (grabs an eggroll) And then I called him, and he wasn’t there."
235,Rachel," Oh, thank you that’s very helpful, I’m glad you came over."
237,Rachel, Hello.
238,Ross, Hi! It’s me.
239,Rachel," Hi! Oh, I’m so glad you called."
240,Ross," Really? I’ve been thinking, this is crazy, I mean don’t,
don’t you think we can work on this? "
242,Ross, Who’s that?
243,Rachel, Nobody.
246,Ross, Is that Mark?
247,Rachel," Umm, honey, look he just came over to...."
249,Ross," Yeah! Got it! (slams the phone down, and walks back to the bar.)"
251,Ross," Ah, that’s okay, thanks."
253,Ross," Look, I don’t feel like dancing, I feel like having a drink. Okay?"
257,Monica, Oh. (to Phoebe) Can I have a tissue?
258,Phoebe," Oh, yeah, sure. I just hope you, hope you don’t accidentally suck
it up through your nose and choke on it."
261,Phoebe," Well, tell him, apology accepted."
264,Phoebe," Excuse me, but umm, isn’t he paying for your dinner?"
265,Monica," Hey, the man’s dog just died."
268,Monica," It will be my pleasure. (to Phoebe) My guy has diplomatic coupons. Your
guy can’t even say coupons. (they leave)"
270,Phoebe," Plate! Yes, plate."
272,Phoebe," See, we don’t need them."
274,Phoebe, Yeah.
276,Ross, (to Chloe) I like this song.
278,Ross," Oh, no, no."
281,Rachel," (picks up the phone and calls Ross) Oh, be home, be home, be home, be
home, be home, be home. Be home. Be home, be home, be home. Oh, you’re not home."
290,Phoebe, Ameri-can.
292,Phoebe," Ameri-can. Y'know it’s a very hard language. Let’s do
it again."
2,Ross," I mean, I don’t feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore."
3,Rachel," You want me to just quit my job so that you can feel like you’ve
got a girlfriend?"
4,Ross, Is this about Mark?
5,Rachel, (shocked) Oh my God.
6,Ross," Okay, it’s not, it’s not."
7,Rachel," Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight with you Ross! Look,
urrgh, maybe we should take a break."
8,Ross," Fine, you’re right. Let’s ah, let’s take a break, (goes to
the door) let’s cool off, okay, let’s get some frozen yoghurt, or something..
(opens the door)"
9,Rachel, No. A break from us.
12,Rachel," Then, we had this big, stupid fight, and I said I wanted to take a
break, I don’t want to take a break."
13,Ross," (on the phone) I’ve been thinking, this is crazy, I mean don’t,
don’t you think we can work on this? "
15,Ross, Who’s that?
16,Rachel, Nobody.
17,Ross, Is that Mark?
18,Rachel," Umm, honey, look he just came over to...."
19,Ross, Yeah! Got it! (slams down the phone)
25,Monica, Hey.
26,Rachel, Hey.
27,Monica, How’s the big anniversary dinner?
28,Rachel," Well, we never actually got to dinner."
29,Monica," Ohhh, nice."
30,Rachel," No, we kinda broke up instead."
31,Monica," What?! (She accidentally starts the blender without the lid on it and
fruit flies everywhere.)"
32,Rachel," (looking up at the ceiling) God, Monica it’s on the ceiling."
33,Monica," That’s okay, this is more important than fruit (pause) (angrily) on
my ceiling! You broke up?!"
34,Rachel," Yeah, but it’s okay, because when Ross left Mark came over."
35,Monica, Oh no!! 
36,Rachel, No.
37,Monica," Rachel, you and Mark?!"
38,Rachel," No, no-no, it’s okay, calm down. Mark and I talked, and I realised
how much I love your stupid brother, and, yeah, we got our problems, but I really want to
make it work."
44,Rachel," (on answering machine) Hi, it’s me. I’ve been trying to reach
you all night. I feel awful. Please, Ross, you gotta know there is nothing between me and
Mark. This whole break-up thing is just stupid. "
45,Ross, Yeah!!
46,Rachel," Eh, I’m just so sorry I put you through it. And, I y'know, I
don’t want to get back together over a machine."
47,Ross, Na-huh.
48,Rachel," So, I love you."
49,Ross, I love you.
50,Rachel," And y'know what, I’m gonna, I’m gonna go to bed now, but ah,
on my way to work tomorrow morning, I’m gonna stop by around 830."
51,Ross, Okay. (Ross starts frantically looking for a clock.)
52,Rachel, Bye.
54,Ross," Chloe, Chloe how’s it coming?!!"
56,Ross," Umm, oh, hey, I don’t know. How about a big one?"
58,Ross," Well then a small one!! Listen, let’s, we kinda have to get going!"
60,Ross," You, you sure you need shoes? (Chloe nods her head) Okay. (reaches down
and picks up a shoe)"
62,Ross," Yeah, y'know the ah, the girlfriend I told you about last night?
(He’s frantically throwing the cushions off of the couch looking for her other shoe)
Well it turns out she ah, she wants to get back together with me. Oh, I found it!! "
64,Ross, Yeah! 
66,Ross," Yes, yes I am, one of the many things I’m feeling. Well.... (picks up
her coat)"
68,Ross," Oh, thank you. (She goes to kiss him, but he holds her coat up between
their faces to stop her.) Hey, hey. (opens the door, sees Rachel, and hides Chloe behind
the door) Rachel!!!!"
69,Rachel," Hi. Ohhh, you got my message."
70,Ross," Yeah, oh hey, you are right on time."
71,Rachel, So what do you say? Can I be your girlfriend again?
72,Ross," Yes, you can, very much."
74,Ross, (seeing the thumbs up) Ahhhh!! (Hugs Rachel tighter.)
76,Phoebe, Hey!
77,Monica, Hey.
78,Phoebe," Hey, why are you mopping your ceiling?"
79,Monica," Oh, there’s banana on it."
80,Phoebe," Wow, I have the spirit of an old Indian women living in mine."
81,Monica, So then you know? (Phoebe nods her head)
82,Phoebe," The mailman was downstairs, so I brought up your mail."
83,Monica," Oh, good. Thanks."
84,Phoebe, Now what is Fabutec?
85,Monica," Okay, all right don’t judge me to much. Okay? Um, but I saw this
info-mercial, and um, I swear to you I have never-ever bought anything on TV before,
except for this mop. But there was this stuff on leg waxing, it just, it looked so
amazing...."
86,Phoebe, Waxine!!
87,Monica, Yes! Have you seen it?
88,Phoebe," Oh, it’s incredible! I so want to be a Waxine girl."
89,Monica, I know!!
90,Phoebe," God. Do think it really doesn’t hurt? ‘Cause how can they do
that?"
91,Monica," Hello! Organic substances recently discovered in the depths of the rain
forest!"
92,Phoebe, They have the best stuff in there.
94,Chandler, Oh my God! Oh my God!
95,Joey," Yeah. We figured when we couldn’t find you, you’d gone home to
make up with Rachel. Which is probably what you shoulda done. Huh?"
96,Ross," You think?! God, I, ah, I’m in hell. I mean what, what am I gonna do?
Rachel’s all like, ‘I love you and, and let’s work on this.’ And all I
can think about is, ‘What is she gonna do? What is she gonna say?’ when I tell
her what I did."
97,Chandler," Well, before we answer that, I think we should address the more
important question. How dumb are you?"
98,Ross," What?! Look, we’re trying to rebuild a relationship here, right. How
am I supposed to do that here, without being totally honest with each other?"
99,Joey," Look, Ross look, I’m on board about this totally honesty thing, I am,
just not about stuff that’s gonna get you in trouble."
100,Chandler," He’s right. Nobody’s gonna benefit, and you’re just
gonna hurt her."
101,Joey," Yeah, and there won’t be a relationship left to rebuild."
102,Ross," Yeah, but don’t you think...."
103,Chandler," All right look, if you absolutely have to tell her, at least wait
until the timing’s right. And that’s what deathbeds are for."
104,Ross," Yeah, okay. (he plops down into one of the leather chairs, with the
footrest extended.)"
105,Joey," All right, okay, now, we just have to make sure she doesn’t find out
some other way. (spins the chair around so that Ross is facing him) Did you think about
the trail?"
106,Ross, What trail?
107,Joey," (stomps on the footrest which pops Ross up into a sitting position) The
trail from the woman you did it with to the woman you hope never finds out who did it!
(slapping his hands with each word) You always have to think about the trail!"
108,Ross," Oh, I-I don’t think there’s any trail."
109,Chandler," Okay, okay-okay, ah, Chloe works with that guy Issac. Issac’s
sister is Jasmine. And Jasmine works at that message place with Phoebe. And Phoebe’s
friends with Rachel. And that’s the trail, I did it!"
111,Phoebe," (reading from the instructions) After applying the Waxine and linen
strips to leg number one, "
112,Monica, Did that!
113,Phoebe," Grasp one of the linen strips by its ‘easy grab tab’ and pull
it off in one quick pain free motion."
114,Monica, Okay. (Does so.) Ow!!!!! Ow-oh-oh!
115,Phoebe, Was it not pain-free?
116,Monica," No. It was painful. Oh my God , they should call it Pain-zine, now with
a little wax."
117,Phoebe," Huh, well, the girls in the satin nighties on the commercial don’t
seem to think it’s that bad."
118,Monica," That’s because their nerves are probably deadened from being so
stupid. But hey, y'know if you don’t believe me, please, by my guest."
119,Phoebe, (Removing one of the strips) Ow-ow-ow-ow! Oh my God!!!
120,Monica," Now, are you glad we didn’t start with the bikini strips?"
122,Ross, (entering) Chloe? Hi.. 
124,Ross, You took my watch?
126,Ross," Just you keep it, listen did you, did you tell anyone about us?"
128,Ross," Exactly. So you didn’t, didn’t mention anything to Issac right?"
130,Ross," You tell, of course you do. Issac. Issac. Hey, Issac. Issac, hi! Y'know we
haven’t actually met..."
132,Ross," Yes, I suppose I am a dog. But Issac, see I-I happen to have a girlfriend."
134,Ross," Yeah, that’s the one. Listen, I don’t want to hurt her."
136,Ross," Yeah. Listen, can you keep this information to yourself?"
138,Ross," Actually, no, we’re not."
140,Ross," No, we’re not."
142,Ross," No, we’re not!!"
144,Ross, Right.
146,Ross, Fine. I just need to know that you’re not gonna tell your sister.
149,Ross, (entering out of breath) Jasmine? 
151,Ross," We met at Phoebe’s birthday party, I’m, I’m Ross Geller."
153,Ross," Yes, I did."
155,Ross, Very bad.
157,Ross," I’m agreeing with you. Did you, listen, did you happen to tell Phoebe
yet?"
159,Ross," Okay, Jasmine, please, please don’t. I love my girlfriend very much,
and I want more than anything to just work it out with her. Okay?"
161,Ross," Thank you, thank you."
163,Ross, (angrily) Who’s your roommate?
165,Ross," Gunther! Gunther. Gunther, please tell me you didn’t say anything to
Rachel about me and the girl from the Xerox place."
170,Monica, Ow!
171,Phoebe, Oh!!
172,Monica, Ow!! Ow!!
173,Phoebe, Ow!!!
176,Phoebe, We’re all right.
177,Monica," It’s okay, it’s okay."
178,Phoebe, We’re all right.
179,Monica, We were just waxing our legs.
180,Chandler, Off?!!
181,Phoebe," For your information, this happens to be a pain like no man will ever
experience."
182,Chandler," Yeah, well I don’t think you can make that statement, unless
you’ve been kicked in an area that God only meant to be treated nicely."
183,Joey," Yeah, I-I think that women just have a lower threshold of pain than men,
that’s all. I mean, come on, it’s just a little wax."
184,Phoebe," Oh yeah, come here. (Puts a little wax on Joey’s arm and puts a
strip on it.)"
185,Chandler," Oh, that’s mature."
186,Joey," Okay, fine, so now what, I just pull it off?"
187,Phoebe, Uh-huh.
188,Monica, That’s right.
191,Ross," (forcing the door open) Come on, Rachel, come on! Talk to me! Please!!"
193,Rachel, I can’t talk to you. I can’t even look at you right now!
194,Monica, What?
195,Chandler," Nothing, nothing."
196,Monica, (going over to listen at the door) Rachel said everything was okay.
197,Phoebe," (to Joey) What, what are they talking about?"
198,Ross, Rachel?
200,Rachel, Just get away from me!
201,Ross," No, it was a mistake! I made a mistake! Okay?"
202,Rachel, A mistake?! What were you trying to put it in? Her purse?!
204,Phoebe, Whe-where did he put it?!
206,Rachel," Ross, you had sex with another woman!"
208,Monica, Oh my God.
209,Phoebe," Oh, I knew something had to be wrong, because my fingernails did not
grow at all yesterday."
210,Chandler," Yeah, well, I guess they had a fight, and he got drunk...."
211,Monica," Oh!! (hits Chandler and Joey in the head) You guys knew about this and
you didn’t tell us?!"
212,Chandler," (to Joey) He has sex, and we get hit in our heads."
214,Rachel," (opening the door) Y'know what, I want you to leave! Get outta here! "
215,Ross, No!!
216,Rachel, Just get out! Now!!
217,Ross, No!! No!! I wanna stay. I wanna talk about this.
218,Rachel, Okay! All right! How was she?
220,Chandler, Uh-oh.
222,Ross, What?
223,Rachel, Was she good?
225,Joey, Don’t answer that.
227,Rachel," Come on Ross! You said you wanted to talk about it, let’s talk
about it!! How was she?"
228,Ross, She was...
230,Joey, Awful! Horrible!
231,Chandler, She was not good. Not good.
232,Joey, She was nothing compared to you.
234,Ross," She, she was different."
236,Joey, Ewwwww!
237,Chandler, Uh-oh.
239,Rachel, Good different?
240,Ross, Nobody likes change.
242,Ross," What? Okay, okay, okay, okay."
244,Phoebe, Should we do something?
245,Chandler," Yeah, never cheat on Rachel."
247,Ross," I’m sorry, okay, I’m sorry. I wa-I was disgusted with myself,
and this morning I was so, I was so upset and then I got your message and I was so happy,
and all I wanted was to get her out of my apartment as fast as possible."
248,Rachel," Whoa!! Whoa, whoa, wait a minute. What time did your little friend
leave? (Ross can’t answer that) Oh my God. She was there? She was still there? She
was in there, when I was in there?!"
250,Ross," Listen. Oh hey, hey, the important thing was that she meant, she meant
nothing to me!"
251,Rachel, And yet she was worth jeopardising our relationship!! 
253,Ross," Look, I didn’t think there was a relationship to jeopardise. I
thought we were broken up. "
254,Rachel, We were on a break!
255,Ross," That, for all I knew would, could last forever. That to me is a break-up."
256,Rachel, You think you’re gonna get out of this on a technicality?
257,Ross," Look, I’m not trying to get out of anything, okay. I thought our
relationship was dead!"
258,Rachel," Well, you sure had a hell of a time at the wake!"
260,Joey," Y'know what, I don’t think we should listen to this anymore. (Goes to
open the door)"
261,Monica," (stopping him) What, what are you doing? You can’t go out there."
262,Joey, Why not?! (to Chandler) I’m hungry.
263,Monica, Because they’ll know we’ve been listening.
265,Rachel, God! And to have to hear about it from Gunther!!
266,Ross," Come on! Like I wanted him to tell you, I ran all over the place trying to
make sure that didn’t happen!"
267,Rachel," Oh, that is so sweet. I think I’m falling in love with you all over
again."
269,Chandler," Y'know what, I think we can go out there. I mean they have more
important things to worry about."
270,Joey," Yeah, we’ll be fine."
272,Ross," Look Rachel, I wanted to tell you, I thought I should, I-I did, and then
Chandler and Joey convinced me not to."
274,Chandler," (handing Monica the wax) Wax the door shut, we’re never leaving,
ever."
276,Phoebe," Hi, it’s Phoebe. Listen someone’s gonna have to take my 900
with Mr. Rehack, ‘cause it’s like 915 now, and I’m not there."
278,Ross," Don’t you realise none of this would’ve ever happened if I
didn’t think at that same moment you weren’t having sex with Mark?"
279,Rachel," All right. Let’s say I had slept with Mark. Would you have been
able to forgive me?"
280,Ross, (pause) Yes I would.
281,Rachel," You’d be okay if you knew that Mark had kissed me, and been naked
with me, and made love to me?"
282,Ross, (less sure) Yes.
283,Rachel," You knew that our hot, sweaty, writhing bodies were...."
284,Ross," (covering his ears and screaming) La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la! Okay,
okay, yeah, I would have been devastated but, I would still want to be with you. Because
it’s, I mean it’s you."
288,Ross," What? Come on Rach, tell me what you’re thinking?"
289,Rachel," I’m thinking, I’m gonna order a pizza."
290,Ross," Order a pizza like, ‘I forgive you?’"
293,Joey," Oh man, pizza? I like pizza. (makes like he is trying to send a telepathic
message to Rachel) Put olives on the pizza."
294,Phoebe, We could eat the wax! It’s organic.
295,Chandler," Oh great, food with hair on it."
296,Phoebe," No, not the used wax."
297,Chandler, Because that would be crazy?
299,Ross," Hey, can I, can I get in on that? Because I’m kinda hungry myself."
300,Rachel," Fine. (on phone) Hi! Yes, I’d like to order a large pizza."
301,Ross, No anchovies.
302,Rachel," With ah, extra anchovies."
303,Ross," That’s okay, I’ll just pick ‘em off."
304,Rachel," Yeah, and could you please chop some up and just put it right there in
the sauce?"
306,Ross," You can have the last piece, if you want."
307,Rachel," Well, I should think so. You slept with someone."
309,Phoebe," They’re gonna get through this, aren’t they?"
310,Chandler," Yeah, come on, it’s Ross and Rachel, they’ve got too."
311,Monica, What if they don’t?
313,Joey, You think I need a new walk?
314,Chandler, What?
315,Joey," Well y'know, I’ve been walking the same way since high school.
Y'know, y'know how some guys they walk into a room and everybody takes notice. I think I
need a ‘take notice’ walk."
316,Chandler, Are you actually saying these words?
318,Ross," What, now you’re not even taking to me? (moves over to the coffee
table) Look Rachel, I-I’m sorry, okay, I’m sorry, I was out of my mind. I
thought I’d lost you, I didn’t know what to do. Come on! Come on, how insane
must I have been to do something like this? Huh? I-I don’t cheat right, I,
that’s not me, I’m not Joey!"
320,Joey," Whoa-ho-ho! (He looks at Chandler, who gives him a ‘come on’
look.) Yeah, okay."
321,Monica," Hey. It’s three in the morning. They don’t know that I’ve
come home yet. You notice how neither one of them are wondering where I am."
322,Phoebe," Yeah, y'know, people can be so self-involved."
324,Ross," Y'know what, y'know what, I’m-I’m not the one that wanted that,
that break, okay. You’re the one that bailed on us. You’re the one that, that
ran when things got just a little rough!"
325,Rachel, That’s....
326,Ross, That’s what?!
327,Rachel, That is neither here nor there.
328,Ross," Okay, well here we are. Now we’re in a tough spot again, Rach. What
do you want to do? How do you want to handle it? Huh? Do you wanna fight for us? Or, do
you wanna bail? (sits down next to her) Look, I, (on the verge of tears) I did a terrible,
stupid, stupid thing. Okay? And I’m sorry, I wish I could take it back, but I
can’t. (We see Monica and Phoebe are almost in tears.) I just can’t see us
throwing away something we know is so damn good. Rachel, I love you so much."
330,Rachel," No Ross!! (stands up and moves away from him) Don’t! You can’t
just kiss me and think you’re gonna make it all go away, okay? It doesn’t work
that way. It doesn’t just make it better. Okay?"
331,Ross," Okay, okay, okay."
332,Rachel, (softly) I think you should go.
333,Ross, What?
334,Rachel, (softly) I really think you need to go now.
335,Ross," (moving over to stand in front of her) Okay, okay. This morning you said
there was nothing so big that we couldn’t work past it together..."
336,Rachel," Yeah, what the hell did I know!"
337,Ross," Look, look, there’s got to be a way we can work past this. Okay,
(takes a hold of one of her arms.) I can’t imagine, I can’t imagine my life
without you. (Both of them are starting to cry.) Without, without these arms, and your
face, and this heart. Your good heart Rach, (drops to his knees and hugs her around her
waist) and, and...."
338,Rachel," (crying) No. I can’t, you’re a totally different person to me
now. I used to think of you as somebody that would never, ever hurt me, ever. God, and now
I just can’t stop picturing with her, I can’t, (Ross stands up and backs away)
it doesn’t matter what you say, or what you do, Ross. It’s just changed,
everything. Forever."
340,Ross," (crying) Yeah, but this can’t be it, I mean."
342,Rachel, Then how come it is?
345,Phoebe, They’ve been quiet for a long time.
346,Joey, Maybe she killed him?
347,Chandler, Let’s go.
349,Chandler, (to Joey) Is that your new walk?
350,Joey," (whispering) No, I really have to pee."
0,Joey, Can I see the comics?
1,Chandler, This is the New York Times.
2,Joey," Okay, may I see the comics?"
4,Monica, Guys. I thought you were taking Ross to the game?
5,Chandler, We are. He’s meeting us here.
6,Monica, No! Rachel is meeting us here.
7,Phoebe," Oh come on, they can be in the same room."
8,Joey," Yeah, you shoulda been there last night."
9,Phoebe, Why? What happened now?
10,Joey," Well Ross was hangin’ out over at our place, Rachel comes over to
borrow some moisturiser from Chandler...."
11,Chandler," Yeah y-you, how hard is it to say something? Rachel came over to
borrow something."
12,Joey, Anyway! Her and Ross just started yelling at each other.
13,Phoebe," Wait. Why was he yelling at her? He’s the one who slept with
someone else. "
14,Joey," Well, I guess he says that because they were on a break when it happened,
that she should of forgiven him by now."
15,Phoebe," Whoa!! He is soo unreasonable! God, although I think I understand what
he means. Oh my God, this is like 60 Minutes, okay, when, when, at first
you’re really mad at that pharmaceutical company for making the drug and then y'know
you just feel bad for the people because they needed to make their hair grow."
16,Chandler," Y'know what this is like? This is like when my parents got divorced.
Man, I hope Ross doesn’t try to kidnap me after Cub Scouts."
17,Phoebe," Y'know I had a dream where Ross and Rachel were still together, they
never broke up. And we were all just like hanging out, and everyone was happy...."
18,Joey, I had the same dream!
19,Phoebe," Yeah, and nobody slept with that Xerox girl. "
20,Joey," Oh, I had the opposite dream."
21,Chandler," Y'know what maybe it’s gonna be okay, I mean it’s been a
week."
22,Joey," Yeah, I mean it’s never taken me a week to get over a relationship."
23,Monica," It’s never taken you more than a shower to get over a
relationship."
25,Monica," (seeing her) Okay, let’s go!! Let’s hit the road!!"
26,Rachel, Hey!
27,Monica, Let’s get the show on it! 
28,Rachel," Okay, let me just get a cup of coffee."
29,Monica," Oh Rachel, I know the best coffee house and it’s sooo close."
30,Rachel, Closer than here?
31,Phoebe," (turning around and picking a cup off of a table) Oh, hey, look, I found
coffee! (handing her the cup) Okay, let’s skedaddle."
32,Rachel," Wait, I’m not just gonna drink somebody’s old coffee."
33,Phoebe," Okay, your highness."
35,Phoebe," (in a deep voice, imitating Ross) Um, Rachel I’m really sorry.
(imitating Rachel) That’s okay, do you wanna get back together? (imitating Ross)
Yeah, okay. (in her normal voice) Did anyone else hear that?!"
38,Rachel, (softly) Is he here?
39,Chandler, No.
40,Rachel, Oh. (smiles) Here’s your moisturiser. Hi! 
42,Rachel," You guys are gonna love meee! Okay, check it out, Thursday night, five
tickets, Calvin Klein lingerie show, and you guys are coming with me. (they’re
all silent and look away) Okay, I said that out loud right?"
43,Chandler," Yes, yes, it’s just that we ah, we kinda all ready, made plans
with Ross."
44,Rachel," Oh, well okay. Well, there you go."
45,Phoebe," No, it’s just that he got this new like home theater dealie, and he
wants y'know, us to check it out."
46,Rachel, Hm-mm.
47,Chandler," Yeah, he’s really excited about it too, he even recorded show
times on his answering machine."
48,Rachel, Ohh!
49,Monica, We’re sorry honey.
50,Rachel," Oh, it’s okay. (starts to leave)"
51,Joey," Rach, it’s, it’s ah, it’s not that we don’t want to,
really. (quietly) Are we talking models in their underwear?"
52,Rachel, And heels.
53,Joey," (He turns around to Chandler looking for approval to go with Rachel,
Chandler mouths ‘Come on!’) (turning back to Rachel) Ross, did ask us first, and
we set that night aside."
54,Rachel," No, hey, come on, if he asked you first, that’s only fair. (leaves)"
56,Phoebe," Ohhh boy, do I feel bad."
57,Joey, Oh yeah.
58,Monica, Very bad.
60,Phoebe, Chandler what are you doing?!
61,Monica, Chandler!!
62,Chandler, (jumps back and points at the cigarette) Oh my God!
63,Joey, You’re smoking again?!
64,Chandler," Well, actually, yesterday I was smoking again. Today, I’m,
I’m smoking still."
65,Phoebe, Why would you start again after chewing all that quitting gum?
66,Chandler," Look, I’m telling you this is just like my parents divorce, which
is when I started smoking in the first place."
67,Monica, Weren’t you nine?!
68,Chandler," Yeahhh. I’m tellin’ ya something, that ah, first smoke after
nap time...."
70,Chandler," Oh that’s great, with my luck, that’s gonna be him."
71,Phoebe," Him? Him, Ross?"
72,Chandler," Nope, hymn 253, His Eyes Are On The Sparrow! When my parents got
divorced is when I started using humour as a defence mechanism. (answers the door and
it’s Rachel again.)"
73,Rachel," Hi! Uhh, do you guys have plans for the weekend? Because I have my
sister on hold, and she said that we could use her cabin for the weekend and go skiing.
Huh? I’m asking you first, right?!. I mean I’m playing by the rules."
75,Rachel, Chandler! You’re smoking? What are you doing?!
76,Chandler," Hey, shut up!! You’re not my real Mom!!"
78,Joey," (obviously cold) Hey, can you close that window Chandler? My nipples can
cut glass over here!"
79,Phoebe, Wait. Really?! ‘Cause mine get me out of tickets.
80,Ross," Look, you guys I just wanna say, I really, really appreciate you spending
this time with me. It’s been a pretty hard time right now, so I just wanna say
thanks."
81,Chandler, Can somebody else hug him? I have to stay by the window.
82,Ross," Oh hey, hey, huh, how about this weekend we have a laser disc marathon
okay, and maybe a tournament on my new dart board? Huh, huh, what do you think? (in an
Irish accent) Two days of darts, it’ll be great!"
83,Joey, It’ll be great for next weekend.
84,Ross," No, no, no, this weekend guys!"
85,Joey," It’ll be great for next weekend. I mean, (in an Irish accent)
it’ll be grrreat."
86,Ross, What’s going on?
87,Phoebe," Well, we were um, sorta invited to go skiing, y'know Rachel’s
sister’s cabin. (Chandler goes back to the window to smoke again.)"
88,Ross," So, for the whole weekend?"
89,Monica," We’re really sorry, but um, she did ask us first."
90,Ross," Yeah, that’s okay, I mean if you guys all have to go away for
the first weekend I’m alone by myself, y'know then I totally, totally understand."
91,Phoebe," Y'know what, I can stay, I’m gonna stay. ‘Cause the last time
I went skiing I was to afraid to jump off the chair lift, I just went around and around."
92,Joey," Uh, Pheebs we kinda need you to drive us all up there in your
grandmother’s cab, but y'know what, I’ll stay."
93,Monica, Noo! I’ll stay. He’s my brother.
94,Ross, What a pity stay?
95,Monica, No! We’re gonna have fun. We can make fudge!
96,Ross," Pity food? Y'know what that’s okay, all right, I don’t need any
of you to stay, okay nobody stays."
97,Chandler," Well, then, I might as well offer to stay."
99,Joey," (to Chandler and Monica) Hey, does anybody else feel bad about Ross?"
100,Monica, Why? Do you think he’s still mad at us?
101,Chandler," (to Joey) Well he’s probably mad after you called him this
morning to borrow his goggles."
102,Joey, What? Mine aren’t tinted.
104,Phoebe, Chandler!!
105,Chandler, What?
106,Phoebe, What does the sign say?
107,Chandler, Beam me up Jesus.
108,Phoebe," No, the ‘No Smoking’ sign. There’s no smoking in my
Grandmother’s cab."
109,Chandler," Okay, well, then, I-I have to go to the bathroom."
111,Phoebe, Please!
112,Monica, No Chandler no! No unscheduled stops. You can go when we stop for gas.
113,Chandler," Oh, come on, there’s a rest stop right up there! Come on, I
really have to goooooooooo."
114,Joey," Oh, now I have to go!!"
116,Chandler," Here we go. Okay, brace yourselves."
117,Monica, What?
119,Rachel, Okay.
120,Monica, Ow!
122,Phoebe," (to Rachel, who’s staying in the cab.) Aren’t you gonna go?"
123,Rachel, No. Thank you.
124,Monica," (getting out) No, Rachel never pees in public restrooms."
125,Rachel," Well, they never have any paper in there y'know. So my rule is ‘no
tissue, no tuschy.’ (Phoebe laughs and gets out.) Well, if everybody’s going.
(She gets out and starts to close the door.)"
126,Phoebe," No, y'know what don’t close it (Rachel slams the door shut locking
themselves out.) ‘cause the... keys...are in there."
127,Chandler," Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no!!"
128,Joey, What’s going on?
129,Chandler, (to Joey) My lighter’s in there! (points to the cab)
132,Chandler, Damn! (stands up) The tailpipe’s not hot enough to light this!
133,Joey," Relax okay, I-I-I can get this open. Anybody have a coat hanger?"
134,Chandler," Oh I do! Op, no, wait a minute, I took it out of my shirt when I put
it on this morning."
135,Monica," So, if you’re parents hadn’t got divorced, you’d be able
to answer a question like a normal person?"
136,Joey," Look, I just need a wire something to jimmy it. Oh hey, one of you guys
give me the underwire from your bra!"
137,Monica, What?!
138,Rachel, What?!
139,Joey, Come on! Who has the biggest boobs?
140,Monica, Please!!
141,Joey," Whoever has the biggest boobs, has the biggest bra, therefore has the
biggest wire."
143,Joey," If you wanna get back in the car, we need the wire, your call."
144,Phoebe," Okay, Monica’s are the biggest."
145,Monica," These tiny, little non-breasts?! Please, it’s gotta be Rachel."
146,Rachel," What, no, no, no, mine are deceptively small I mean, I-I-I actually
sometimes, st-stuff my bra."
147,Monica," All right then, your bra would still be big."
148,Rachel," No, I stuff outside the bra."
149,Chandler," Ladies, ladies, let’s just compromise okay? Phoebe, Rachel take
off Monica’s bra."
150,Phoebe," All right, forget it, nevermind, you can have mine."
152,Rachel," (seeing him) Chandler, what are you doing? There is a trash can right
there."
153,Chandler," Well, I thought if I littered, that crying Indian might come by and
save us."
154,Phoebe," (finishing removing her bra) Okay, there."
155,Joey," Thank you Phoebe, that is very, very generous."
156,Chandler," Okay, now let’s decide who has the nicest ass."
157,Joey, (opening the door) And there you go!
160,Monica, Chandler!!
161,Chandler, At least let me smoke it to the good part.
163,Phoebe," Okay. (The car moves a few feet and sputters to a stop.) Oh, no!"
164,Rachel," What, what’s it, what’s going on?"
165,Phoebe," Yeah, this has happened before."
166,Rachel, So you know how to fix it?
167,Phoebe, Yep. Put more gas in.
170,Ross, (entering) Hey.
172,Ross," Well, oh just ah, I was just wondering, when you and I split up, did you
get the tape that was half the last episode of M*A*S*H and half the hostages
coming home?"
174,Ross, Where’s Ben?
176,Ross," Ahh. (notices the table) Ooh, is this a ah, is this a bad time?"
178,Ross," Oh! I thought you guys got married in uh, January?"
180,Ross, Ah! (realises) Oh.
182,Ross," Umm, candles, champagne, yeah anniversaries are great. ‘Cause you
know love lasts forever, y'know. Nothing like it in this lifetime, money in the bank, so
Rachel and I broke up."
184,Ross," Yeah, well."
186,Ross," Oh yeah, I’d love that."
188,Ross," I guess it all started when Rachel got this new job. (he sits down at the
table.)"
190,Phoebe," Okay, yeah. (to Monica and Rachel) Triple A can pick us up."
191,Rachel, Great!
192,Phoebe," Yeah, what town are we near?"
193,Monica," Freemont. West-Westmont, ah Westburg?"
194,Phoebe," (to Monica) Then why are you answering? Do you at least know what route
we’re on?"
195,Rachel," Yeah, we are definitely on Route 27."
196,Phoebe," Okay. (on phone) We are at a rest stop on Route 27. Okay. (to Rachel)
There is no Route 27. (listens) (to Rachel) Okay, either 93 or 76?"
197,Rachel," I don’t know, I’m sorry, I always slept in the back when we
drove up here."
198,Phoebe," Okay. (on phone) Hey, can you send somebody up and down 76 and check
every rest stop, and, and also 93? (listens) Okay! (hangs up) Yeah, no they don’t do
that."
199,Rachel," Ugh, okay, well somebody will come and save us."
200,Monica," Who? I mean have you seen a car come by here in the last hour and a
half? I think we should call Ross, maybe he can get a car and come pick us up."
201,Rachel," No! No, I am not getting in a car with Ross, we will just have to live
here! "
202,Phoebe, But if...
203,Rachel," No you guys, I am not getting in a car with him, you’ll have to
think of something else."
204,Phoebe," Oh good, oh Joey and Chandler are back."
206,Monica, So the going for help went well?
207,Joey," Oh yeah, Smokey Joe here got half way to the highway and collapsed."
208,Chandler," I have the lung capacity of a two year old. (starts to light another
cigarette.)"
209,Monica, Then why are you smoking?
210,Chandler, Well it’s very unsettling.
212,Ross," ....right? Right? I mean it’s pretty unbelievable y'know, I mean they
just took off, took off without even looking back. Y'know I don’t, I don’t need
them, huh, I’ve got you guys now as friends, you and Susan."
215,Ross," (looking at the page) 717? (to Carol) Where’s 717? (He gets up to
return the page, Carol starts to take the last of the food into the kitchen, but Ross
grabs the last piece.) Hey, you’ve have more of these for Susan right?"
218,Phoebe," (answering the phone) (whispering) Ross, thank God."
219,Ross," Pheebs? What, why are you whispering?"
220,Phoebe, I ate a bug.
222,Monica," (running over to stop Rachel) Hey Rach, the tampons here are only a
penny. Let’s stock up. (takes her into the bathroom)"
223,Phoebe," Listen Ross, we ran out of gas, and we don’t know where we are, so
we can’t get a tow truck."
224,Ross," Oh, now you want a favour?"
225,Phoebe," Yes, please."
226,Ross," Well, oh, I’m sorry your car broke down Pheebs, but I’m a little
too busy with some of my real friends right now, but please call to let me know you got
home safely okay?"
228,Ross," No, I’m not gonna pick them up."
230,Ross," No, Rachel doesn’t want me to...."
232,Ross," Yeah, you’re right."
234,Ross," We were on a break!!! Okay!! (grabs the phone) We were, we were..., (calms
down) yeah. Where are you? I’ll find you. (hangs up)"
236,Ross," Oh, you-you’re-you’re one to talk."
238,Joey," Okay, done."
239,Monica, (reading the sign) What’s ‘pleh’?
240,Joey," That’s ‘help’ spelled backwards so that the helicopters can
read it from the air!"
241,Monica, Huh. What’s doofus spelled backwards?
243,Rachel," (all excited) Op, op, car! Car!! (sees it’s Ross) Ugh!!!"
244,Phoebe," Oh, it’s Ross on one of his drives!"
246,Phoebe, Hi!
247,Rachel, What is he doing here?!
248,Ross," He is saving your butt, ah, unless of course I’m stepping on
some toes here, in which case I can just mosey on, I’ve got plenty of people to help
on the Interstate."
250,Rachel, All right!! Fine! Fine.
252,Joey, Arrrghh!!
253,Chandler," Oh no, now it’s not gonna make any sense!"
254,Phoebe," (to Chandler and Monica) You guys, what, what do we do about Ross who
drove all the way up here? What do we do? Just like send him back and we’re then
gonna go skiing?"
255,Chandler," Oh, this is horrible, it’s just horrible."
256,Joey," Guys, do you think we should ask Ross to come along?"
257,Monica," I know, what about Rachel? I mean how are we even gonna ask her?"
258,Rachel, Ask me what?
259,Monica," Umm, if ah, it might be okay if Ross came skiing?"
261,Rachel, You guys are unbelievable. No! He cannot come.
262,Ross, Excuse me?
263,Chandler, It’s horrible.
264,Ross," (sarcastic) Oh please, can’t I come to your special, magical cabin?"
265,Rachel, Why would you even want to come Ross? You’re a horrible skier.
266,Ross," Oh-oh, hitting me where it hurts, my ski skills."
267,Monica, Here we go again.
268,Joey," I-I can’t handle this, you guys."
269,Chandler," Y'know what, I can handle it, handle’s my middle name. Actually
it’s the ah, middle part of my first name."
270,Ross," All right Pheebs, your cab’s ready."
271,Rachel," All right, let’s go!"
272,Ross, You’re welcome.
273,Rachel," Oh, I’m sorry, were you speaking to me or sleeping with someone
else?"
274,Ross, We were on a break!
275,Rachel," Y'know Ross why don’t you put that on your answering
machine!"
276,Ross," Hey-hey, it’s valid okay? And I’m not the only one who thinks
so, Monica agrees with me."
277,Rachel, (to Monica) What?!
278,Monica, (shyly) I don’t know.
279,Ross, That’s what you said last night.
280,Monica," What I said was, was that I understood. Joey’s the one who agreed
with you!"
281,Ross, Okay.
282,Rachel, Really Joey?
283,Joey, (pause) What?
284,Phoebe," Y'know what, but there is, there is no right or wrong, here."
285,Rachel," No, I think it’s very obvious who’s wrong here."
286,Ross, Obviously not to Joey.
288,Joey, (pause) What?
290,Ross," (to Rachel) Look both, Joey and Monica feel the same way that I do.
No-no-no-no."
291,Chandler," Guys, guys, guess who I am?! (starts dancing around in an effort to
stop the fighting.)"
293,Phoebe," Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!! Hey!!! (they all stop fighting, Chandler continues
to dance.) Look what you’re doing to Chandler!! (Chandler finally stops) (to Ross and
Rachel) Yeah, look, we know this is really, really hard for you guys. Okay? (Ross starts
to leave) You don’t, all right you don’t have to love each other, okay? You
don’t, you don’t even have to like each other much right now. But please, you
have to figure out a way to be around each other."
294,Joey," Yeah, and not put us in the middle."
295,Phoebe," Yeah, otherwise, I mean that’s, that’s, that’s just it
for us hanging out together. Y'know is that what you want? (they both look away) Can you
be civil?"
296,Rachel, Yeah.
297,Ross, I can.
298,Phoebe," Okay. Good, all right, let’s get back in the car, ‘cause
it’s freezing, and my chest is unsupported."
299,Joey," Oh what, wait, wait a second, I mean, what are we doing? Who’s going
with who?"
300,Ross," Look, you guys, you guys should go. (Joey tries to say something, but Ross
cuts him off.) No, I’m, you, you planned this all out, and I don’t want to ruin
it, so you guys should just go."
301,Joey," Come on man, you drove all the way up here."
302,Ross," No, no, really, I’ve got to take the car back anyway, I’m
spending all day tomorrow with Ben, It’s fine, no guilt I promise."
303,Rachel, Thank you.
304,Monica," All right, we’ll call you when we get back."
305,Ross, Okay.
306,Phoebe, Maybe we can like go to a movie or something. 
307,Ross, Okay.
308,Phoebe," Or, or the rodeo!!"
309,Ross, That would be great.
310,Phoebe, Okay!
311,Chandler, I was being Shelly Winters from The Poseidon Adventure.
312,Ross, I know!
314,Phoebe, Bye!!!
319,Ross, (entering) Hi! Sorry I’m late. Were you sleeping?
321,Ross," Oh, great! Listen, oh I had to get you a whole new battery. I got you the
best one I could, ‘cause that’s not where you want to skimp."
323,Ross," Yeah, well it came to about $112, but what the hell, just call it an even
110?"
325,Ross, Okay.
327,Ross," So they ah, they all took off, it was pretty hard watching them go,
y'know?"
329,Ross, (outside the door) So I’m gonna take off then!
0,Monica, (to Joey) What’s so funny?
1,Joey," Oh, nothing, no. It’s an acting exercise, I’m practising my fake
laugh."
2,Monica, Oh. (she laughs)
3,Joey, What-what’s so funny?
6,Chandler, Oh come on man! At least let me finish this last one.
8,Chandler, Okay.
11,Chandler," No-no, why don’t you hang on to that one."
13,Chandler," Okay, that’s like the least fun game ever."
14,Rachel," Well, I’m really sick of your smoking, so I brought something that
is going to help you quit. (hands him an audio cassette)"
15,Chandler," Oh. (takes the cassette and puts it on his arm like the stop smoking
patch, and it falls off.) Nope, that patch is no good. (Joey and Monica both do their fake
laughs.)"
16,Rachel," Come on, it’s a hypnosis tape. This woman at work used it for two
weeks straight and she hasn’t smoked since."
17,Ross, Pffhah.
18,Rachel, (to Ross) What’s your problem?
19,Ross," Nothing, it’s just that hypnosis is beyond crap."
20,Rachel," Ross, I watched you get hypnotised in Atlantic City."
21,Ross," Hey, that guy did not hypnotise me! Okay."
22,Rachel," Oh right, ‘cause you always pull your pants down at the count of
three and play Wipe-out on your butt cheeks."
23,Phoebe," All right, y'know forget hypnosis. The way to quit smoking is you have
to dance naked in a field of heather, and then bath in the sweat of six healthy young men."
24,Chandler, Or what my Father called Thursday night.
27,Ross, Here you go.
28,Rachel," Oh, y'know what, I didn’t want cinnamon on this."
29,Ross," Sorry. (To remedy that, Ross scoops the cinnamon off of the top with his
hand.)"
31,Phoebe, Oh my God!! 
33,Phoebe, Frank! Hi!
35,Phoebe, What are you doing here?
37,Phoebe, What happened?
39,Phoebe," But, also, what happened between you and your Mom?"
41,Phoebe, Your getting married?!
44,Phoebe, My little brother’s getting married!!
46,Phoebe, Do I?
48,Phoebe," Yeah, I do, yeah."
50,Chandler," Y'know, I would’ve bet good money that he’d be the first one
of us to get married."
51,Phoebe," Yeah, isn’t it fantastic?"
52,Monica," Yeah, ah, but Pheebs don’t you think he’s a little young to
get married?"
53,Phoebe," What, he’s 18."
54,Ross," Exactly, it’ll be illegal for him to drink at his own bachelor party."
55,Joey," Yeah, or-or to get a hooker."
56,Chandler, Always illegal Joe.
59,Phoebe," Yeah, I’m a big surprise."
61,Monica," So, um, how-how did you guys meet?"
66,Chandler," If that doesn’t keep kids in school, what will?"
67,Ross, And so now you guys are gonna be married?
70,Rachel, Oh my God!! Great!
71,Phoebe," Wow, kids. Frank, are you sure you’re ready for that?"
74,Phoebe, Oh good! Okay. ‘Cause you were acting like you didn’t.
80,Monica," And y'know what, I just realised, in the last year I’ve only gone
out with two guys, Richard and Julio. You gotta help me out here, you gotta set me up, you
gotta get me back in the game."
81,Rachel," Well, that shouldn’t be a problem. I mean I work in fashion and all
I meet are eligible straight men."
82,Monica," (to a customer) Pete, can I get you something else?"
84,Monica, Haven’t you and I covered that topic?
86,Monica," Aww, the only reason you want to go out with me because my blond wig,
and the big boobs, and the fact that I serve you food."
88,Rachel," (laughs) Well, I mean, are you sure you want to go out with her? I mean
that ain’t a pretty picture in the morning, y’know what I mean. That wig all in
disarray, and boobs flung over the night stand, y'know. "
89,Monica," I mean really, think about it."
92,Phoebe," No, I know, I know, that this is Frank’s life, (walks behind them,
they turn around in the leather chairs to face her) y'know. Y'know, I don’t want to
be all judgmental, y'know, but this is sick, it’s sick and wrong!"
93,Ross," Pheebs, what, is it the age thing?"
94,Phoebe," No-no, oh, I’m fine with the age thing y'know, until it starts
sticking it’s tongue down my little brother’s throat! "
95,Joey," Pheebs, he seems to enjoy it."
96,Phoebe," But, I mean, do you think he’s gonna enjoy it when he’s up to
his elbows in the diapers from all the babies they have to have right away?! This is not
fair to Frank, (she walks behind them again, and hey again turn to follow her) and
it-it’s not fair to the babies, and y'know what, it’s not good home economics."
97,Joey," Well, have-have you told him how you feel?"
98,Phoebe, Yes. Not out loud.
99,Ross," Pheebs, if you don’t tell him, soon he’s gonna be married, and
then you’re gonna hate yourself."
100,Phoebe," Yeah, but if I do tell him, then he’s gonna hate myself. I mean
look at him and his Mom, I can’t. (pause) But, you guys can, please you gotta talk
him out of it."
102,Phoebe," Come on, you guys, you have nothing to lose, I have everything to lose.
Do you want me to lose everything? Everything?!"
104,Phoebe," Okay, I’m gonna go get Frank. (exits)"
105,Joey," So, we’re walking down the street and I turn to you and I say,
“Hey, let’s go hang out at Totally Nude Nudes,” remember? And then, and
then, you turn to me and say, “Nah, let’s just hang out at your place.”
Well, that was a nice move dumb ass. "
107,Rachel, I think you should definitely go out with this guy.
108,Monica," Nah, he doesn’t do anything for me."
109,Rachel," Monica, last Saturday night, what happened on Walker Texas Ranger?"
110,Monica," Well, umm, Walker was looking for this big bus load of kids….
(realises) All right, I get your point."
111,Rachel, All right.
112,Chandler," (entering, carrying a briefcase) Hi."
113,Monica, Hey.
114,Chandler," Y'know, I forgot the combination to this about a year ago? I just
carry it around. Do you have any Chap Stick?"
115,Monica," Uh, yeah."
116,Rachel," Hey, how are those tapes working out for ya?"
117,Chandler," Y'know what, pretty good."
118,Rachel, Yeah?
119,Chandler," Good! I haven’t smoked yet today, I feel great, and-and-and
confident, that is a stunning blouse."
120,Rachel, Thank you.
121,Monica, Here you go.
122,Chandler, Thanks
123,Rachel," Hey Mon, let’s give Pete a chance Come on, he was funny, he seems
really nice, and that check thing was adorable."
124,Chandler, What check thing?
125,Monica," As a joke, this customer at work who has a crush on me gave me a $20,000
tip. His number is on the check, he just did so I’d call him."
126,Chandler," (reading the check) Pete Becker. Pete… (quickly grabs a magazine
and opens it up to show her a picture) (pointing to the picture) Is this him?"
127,Monica, That’s Bill Clinton.
128,Chandler, Who’s he huggin’?
129,Monica, Oh my God! That’s Pete! But why is Bill huggin’ Pete?
130,Chandler," This guy invented Moss 865! Every office in the world uses that
program!"
131,Rachel, We use it!!
132,Chandler, There you go!!
133,Rachel," Oh my God, Monica’s gonna go out with a millionaire. "
134,Monica, I’m not gonna go out with him.
135,Rachel," Oh my God, I can’t believe this is a real $20,000 check, oh this is
just so exciting."
136,Monica, Or incredibly offensive.
137,Rachel," Oh yeah, sure, that too."
139,Chandler, (to the girls who are staring at him) What?
141,Ross, All we’re saying is don’t rush into anything.
142,Joey," Yeah, come on, think about it. You’re 18, okay, she’s 44, when
you’re 36, she’s gonna be 88."
144,Joey," Look, the point is, there’s a lot of women out there you haven’t
even had sex with yet!"
145,Ross," Yeah, he-he’s right, he’s right. This is your time y'know, yeah,
you’re young, you’re-you’re weird, chicks dig that."
147,Joey," Yeah, in a poem maybe."
148,Ross," No the man’s right, that’s what I had with Rachel."
150,Ross," No, I ah, I slept with someone else."
152,Ross, It didn’t.
154,Joey," Now, wh-what, what is that like?"
156,Ross," Yeah, yeah."
157,Joey, (to Ross) Why can’t I find that?
158,Ross," Don’t ask me, I had it and I blew it!"
159,Joey," Well, I want it!"
161,Joey," I don’t know, maybe I can’t. I mean, maybe there’s
something wrong with me."
162,Ross," Oh, no! No!"
164,Joey, Then you hold on to it!!
166,Joey," All right, congratulations you lucky bastard! (hugs him)"
168,Phoebe, (to Joey) You’re Frank’s best man?!
169,Joey," I couldn’t help it, there love is so pure."
170,Phoebe," Well then, (to Ross) what about you?! Huh?!"
171,Ross, I’m the ring bearer.
175,Phoebe," Hi! Oh, Alice, hi! Thanks. I’m so glad you could come, ‘cause
I’ve got a real umm, Home Ec emergency. (Points to the table cloth, which has a huge
mustard stain on it.)"
177,Phoebe," Yeah, I know. It’s a real mustard-tastrophe. Can you help me?"
179,Phoebe," Y'know what, forget it. It’s ruined. "
181,Phoebe," Or instead, maybe you could just not marry my brother Frank."
188,Monica, What the hell is this? (holding up the check)
190,Monica," Seriously, what is this supposed to mean?"
192,Monica," You’re supposed to double the tax. Not double the tax of Romania. I
mean, what’s-what’s the deal? Are you, are you trying to buy me? Is this the way
you get girls to go out with you?"
195,Monica, What?!
197,Monica," Okay, umm, you’re a loon."
199,Monica, I don’t know.
201,Monica, ‘Cause I don’t want to encourage this kind of behaviour.
205,Phoebe," Okay. Whoa, sorry. Why were you just like all in the dark?"
207,Phoebe," Oh, yeah, sure. So, how was your day?"
209,Phoebe," What umm, what happened?"
211,Phoebe," Oh no. Did umm, did she say why?"
213,Phoebe," Yeah, yeah, no, I don’t, I don’t know. But, y'know what, maybe
it’s just all for the best?"
215,Phoebe," Oh, sweetie, oh. (hugs him)"
217,Phoebe," Uh, well I can tell you why. It’s, it’s because of me. But,
y'know what, I only did it because I love you. Okay?"
219,Phoebe," Umm, well I, I kinda had a little chat with Alice, and I sort of made
her see why you two shouldn’t be together, y'know. And you’re gonna see it to,
one day, you really, really will."
221,Phoebe, Okay.
223,Phoebe," Okay, but."
226,Rachel, Oh my God! The millionaire’s here!
227,Chandler, (in a feminine way) Oh my God! (and he jumps all around)
228,Monica," Guys, please, I’m just gonna have dinner with him. Okay?"
229,Chandler," Okay, okay, just because he buys you dinner, does not mean you owe him
anything."
230,Monica, I know!!
231,Chandler," Okay, then get the lobster!"
232,Monica, (opening the door) (to Pete) Hey!
234,Rachel, Hi!!
235,Joey, Hey!
236,Ross, Hi!
238,Joey," Hey, how much cash do you got in your pocket right now?"
239,Monica," And that’s why, I’m not inviting you in for a drink. (starts
to leave) Bye."
241,Rachel, Just one drink?!
242,Monica," (in the hallway) So, where do you want to go?"
244,Monica," Oh, that’s sounds great."
249,Monica," Oh come on, it’s only fair, you paid for the flight. Now is, is
that enough lire?"
251,Monica," Why, how much is that?"
254,Joey, Every night!! 
258,Phoebe," Hey, Frank. Look, okay, I know that you think I did like this totally
evil thing, but I so didn’t. There’s someone here who can explain this better
than I can."
262,Phoebe," Yeah, but not just that."
264,Phoebe, None the less.
266,Phoebe," That’s right, exactly. (sees them) All right, it’s a good bye
kiss, that’s good. (Frank picks Alice up and they move to the couch) Bye-bye. (They
both lie down on the couch and start to make out.) Okay, no, the important thing is that
you see what I’m saying, y'know, just y'know, this is clearly wrong. (They ignore
her) Okay, I’ve decided I’m gonna let this happen! Okay, can I just get my
purse? (She reaches in and Alice moans) Okay, all right, good. (leaves)."
270,Joey," (He’s recorded his voice on the tape) Joey’s your best friEnd.
You want to make him a cheese sandwich everyday. (he laughs) And you also want to buy him
hundreds of dollars worth of pants. "
1,Rachel, Thank you.
4,Rachel," Hi! All right, let’s go shoppin’!!"
6,Rachel," Oh, okay."
9,Rachel, Wow! Umm....
15,Monica," Oh, this is so great."
17,Monica," All right then. (He leans in to kiss her goodnight, but she quickly
kisses him on the cheek and pats his shoulder.) Bye."
19,Monica," Hello, people who do not live here."
21,Monica, I gave you a key for emergencies!
22,Phoebe, We were out of Doritos.
23,Ross," Hey, how’d the date go with Mr. Millionaire?"
24,Chandler," Mr. Millionaire, new from Snooty Playthings! Third wife sold
separately."
25,Monica," He’s great! I mean we have such a good time together! He’s so
funny, and sooo sweet, and I’m not attracted to him at all!!"
26,Ross, Still?!
27,Monica," Noo!! It’s driving me crazy. I mean every other way he’s like
the perfect guy, he has everything. Plus! He actually has everything."
28,Chandler, Life-sized Imperial Storm Troopers from Sharper Image?
29,Monica, Two.
30,Chandler, Wow!! Can Joey and I put them on and fight?
31,Joey," (entering, dancing and singing) Oh mommie, oh daddie, I am a big old
baddie! Oh mommie, oh daddie, I am a big old baddie! (He dances around the dinner table
and exits)"
32,Ross, I guess he musta gotten the part in that play.
34,Chandler," Yeah, either that, or Gloria Estefan was right, eventually, the rhythm
is going to get you."
37,Joey," Good. (He sets his stuff down and starts talking to Kate, another cast
member.) Hey."
39,Joey," Oh, so you’re playing Adrienne, huh?"
41,Joey," Oh, no. Ah, I playing your husband, Victor. I’m Joey Tribianni."
44,Joey," So the ah, play’s pretty great, huh?"
46,Joey," Oh, forget about it. She rocks!"
48,Joey," Dr. Drake Remoray. Days of Our Lives. Voted most datable
neurosurgeon by Teen Beat."
50,Joey," Hey, I’ve done plays before. I’m a serious actor."
52,Joey," See, I actually can pour milk, but I got you believing that I
couldn’t. Now, see, that’s acting."
54,Joey," Yeah, that was real."
56,Phoebe, Wow! I cannot believe Mark asked you out.
57,Rachel, I know.
58,Phoebe," What, so what are you gonna tell him?"
59,Rachel," Well, I told him I would think about it, but I’m gonna tell him no."
60,Phoebe, Huh.
62,Rachel," I mean I think I’d say no to anybody right now. (Hearing this
Gunther swoops back to cleaning tables.) Oh, but it was so strange. I mean I’m
standing there with this charming, cute guy, who’s asking me to go out with him,
which I’m allowed to do, and I felt guilty. Y'know, like I’d be cheating on Ross
or something."
63,Phoebe," Wow. So, okay, maybe that means that, you’re not over Ross yet and
you have issues with your father."
64,Rachel, I don’t have any issues with my Father.
65,Phoebe," Okay, so it’s probably just the Ross thing then."
67,Joey," I hate this woman!! I hate her! She told everyone in the company about
that info-mercial, and now they all keep asking me to open their drinks. Okay, and
whenever I can’t do it, they’re all like-like laughing at me."
68,Ross, (entering) Hello.
70,Ross, So Rachel called. Wants to see me. Going over in a minute.
71,Joey," Wow, what-what do you think she wants?"
72,Ross," Well, maybe the crazy fog has lifted and she realises that life without
me.... a-sucks."
73,Chandler," It’s possible. You are very loveable, I’d miss you if I
broke up with you. (Ross glares at him) I was just trying to be supportive."
74,Ross, Then be supportive like a guy.
75,Chandler," (in a deep voice) If I broke up with you, I’d miss you."
77,Ross, Hi.
78,Rachel, Hi!
79,Ross," You ah, wanted to see me?"
80,Rachel," Yeah. Ahh, here’s a box of your stuff. (hands him a box)"
81,Ross, What?!
82,Rachel," Oh, y'know, it’s just like hats, and a shirt, and CD’s, just
sort of stuff that you’ve left here."
83,Ross, What are you doing? Are you trying to hurt me? Or something?
84,Rachel," No. Ross, it, it just seems that y'know it’s time we-we y'know,
move on. I mean, I mean don’t’ you think?"
85,Ross, Yes. 
86,Rachel, Yeah?
87,Ross," Yes, I do."
88,Rachel, Good.
89,Ross," Yeah, I-I really do. (takes a dinosaur mug out of the box) Hey! This-this
was a gift?!"
90,Rachel," Ross, you got that for free from the museum gift shop."
91,Ross, It’s still a gift! I got it from the gift shop!
92,Rachel," Okay, all right, give me the mug! I’ll keep the mug."
93,Ross," No!! Y'know-y'know don’t do me any favours. In fact, where,
where’s the rest of my stuff?! Huh? Like-like my umm, (picks up a book) Hey, this
book is mine!! And-and-and, and that T-shirt you sleep in? I’d like that back too.
Yes, I do."
94,Rachel," You know how much I love that T-shirt! You never even where that
T-shirt!"
95,Ross," I’m just trying to help you, move on."
96,Rachel," Oh, you are a petty man. You are a petty, petty...."
97,Ross, Petty...
98,Rachel, Petty... (goes into her room)
99,Ross, Petty...
100,Rachel, Petty...
101,Ross, Petty...
102,Rachel, Small...
103,Ross," Small... (Rachel comes back into the living room and catches Ross mocking
her.)"
104,Rachel, You are so just doing this out of spite.
105,Ross," Awwwahuh, no, no, no!!"
106,Rachel, Huh?
107,Ross," I’m-I’m gonna wear this all the time! I love this shirt!! (he
kisses the shirt)"
108,Rachel," You have not worn that T-shirt since you were 15!! It doesn’t even
fit you anymore!"
109,Ross," Oh, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah..."
110,Rachel, (imitating him) yeah-yeah-yeah!!
111,Ross," Oh-oh, okay, okay! (He quickly takes off his sweater in order to put on
the T-shirt. It’s an old ‘Frankie says relax’ T-shirt, that barely fits
him. Rachel nods her head in approval of the new look.) If you don’t mind I’m
gonna the rest of my stuff, and relax, in my favourite shirt. (Starts to leave) You have a
pleasant evening. (He exits and leaves the door open.)"
113,Phoebe," So, you’re like a zillionaire? (Pete smiles and nods)"
114,Chandler, And you’re our age. You’re our age.
115,Phoebe," Y'know what, you should like, you should buy a state and then just name
it after yourself."
117,Phoebe," Yeah, or, or, or, Mississ-Pete."
118,Joey," Oh, oh, I got it! Pete-Chicago."
119,Chandler, That’s not a state Joe.
120,Joey," Oh, and Mississ-Pete is?"
123,Chandler, You’re our age!
125,Monica," Absolutely! (He goes to kiss her, but she stops him and rubs his head
and says...) Now get out of here you!! (Pete leaves) (to the gang) Okay, I’m running
out of places I can touch him! Look, is there something wrong with me? I mean why am I
only attracted to guys where there’s no future? Either they’re too old, or
they’re too young, and then there’s Pete who’s-who’s crazy about me,
and who’s absolutely perfect for me, and there’s like zip going on! I mean,
seriously, does it sound like something’s wrong with me?!"
126,Phoebe," Yeah, kinda."
129,Joey," Well, why don’t you tell me what you’re supposed to be! Huh?
Because I sure as hell can’t figure it out! I talk to you and nothin’. You look
at me, and it’s nothin’. (He kisses her) Nothing."
135,Joey, Yeah.
137,Joey," Oh, hey, how about this one. Ah, it’s says so in the script! Y'know
ah, I-I don’t know why my character likes you either, I mean it says in the script
here that you’re a bitch."
139,Joey, It does in mine!
141,Chandler," I can blow dry it. I can put gel on it. It doesn’t matter, I
still wind up with this little (pats the flat spot on the back of his head) cowlicky thing
on the middle part of my head. It’s so annoying. Does it bug you?"
142,Ross, You bug me.
144,Chandler, Is there any chance you didn’t see that?
147,Chandler," Ross! You gotta stop! Okay?! You can’t just stare through the
peep hole for three hours! You’re gonna get peep eye!"
148,Ross," I knew it! I knew it! I always knew she liked him! Y'know, she’d say
no, but here we are! Right? We just broke up, first thing she does!"
149,Chandler, You didn’t just break up.
150,Ross," Hey, it’s been like three weeks!"
151,Chandler," You slept with somebody three hours after you thought you broke up. I
mean bullets have left guns slower!"
152,Ross," Here they come, here they come. Oh-ho, if she kisses him goodnight,
I’m gonna kill myself, I swear. I can’t, I can’t watch this. (turns away,
then quickly turns to look again) Come on, date over! Date over! Uh-oh, here we go,
she’s going in."
153,Chandler, Okay.
154,Ross," She’s going in. Wait! He’s going in! He’s going in!! The
door’s closed! I, I can’t see anything but the door closed!!"
155,Chandler, And the inventor of the door rests happily in his grave.
156,Ross," Okay, I have to do something. I mean, I have, I have to stop it!"
157,Chandler, Stop what?!
158,Ross," I don’t know, but I ah, I have the feeling that my being there will
do it. I’ll go over and I will borrow something. Juice!! I need juice!!"
160,Chandler, No!! You can’t!! 
161,Ross," Look, they must be stopped!"
162,Chandler," I am your friend, and I am not gonna let you do this!!
(Ross is now dragging Chandler and the foosball table to the door) You are surprisingly
strong!"
163,Ross, I need juice! People need juice!!
164,Chandler, Look man!
165,Ross, People need juice!
166,Chandler," Listen to me!! (Chandler turns him around and closes and holds the
door shut with his feet.) "
167,Ross," Juice, I need..."
168,Chandler," She’s moving on! Okay, if it’s not this guy, it’s gonna
be somebody else! And unless you’re thinking about subletting my peep hole, you
are going to have to get used to the fact that the relationship is over! Okay, man?
It’s over."
169,Ross," Yeah, okay. "
170,Chandler, Okay. 
171,Ross, It’s just I miss her so much.
172,Chandler, I know. (He rubs Ross’s head) 
175,Rachel," Oh. That’s so Monica can keep track. That way if one on them is
missing, she can be like, ‘Where’s number 27?!’"
177,Rachel, Y'know what?
179,Rachel, I can’t do this.
181,Rachel," Well, oh, Mark, I’m doing this for the wrong reasons, y'know?
I’m just doing it to get back at Ross. I’m sorry, it’s not very fair to
you."
183,Rachel, Oh God. I’m sorry about this.
185,Rachel, You sure?
190,Monica, Sure.
192,Monica," (looks around) Well, with all these doctors and nurses, I’m gonna
say, midget rodeo."
194,Monica," Okay. Umm, y'know, I don’t think, I don’t think I told you
this, but umm, I just got out of a really serious relationship."
196,Monica," So I did tell you. Okay, y'know, that really isn’t the thing. Umm,
the thing is that, right now I’m just in a place in my life where I need to focus on
me. Y'know what I mean?"
198,Monica, I so wanna be attracted to you.
200,Monica, I’m sorry.
202,Monica, It’s not?
204,Monica," Well, um, look I-I don’t want this to come our wrong, but ah, you
seem awfully confident for a guy I just told I wasn’t attracted too."
210,Chandler," I don’t think this town is big enough for both of us to relax in.
(He blows on his hand) Draw!! (He quickly pulls the lever to raise the foot rest, like a
gunfighter in a Western.) "
212,Chandler," (to Joey) I wasn’t doing anything. (Joey starts angrily throwing
his stuff down.) Uh-oh, what did she do now?"
213,Joey," Just because she went to Yale drama, she thinks she’s like the
greatest actress since, since, sliced bread!"
214,Chandler," Ah, Sliced Bread, a wonderful Lady MacBeth."
215,Joey," God, I just, I hate her! I hate her!! With her, ‘Oh, I’m so
talented.’ and ‘Oh, I’m so pretty,’ and ‘Ooh, I smell so
good.’"
216,Chandler, I think somebody has a crush on somebody.
217,Joey," Hey, Chandler, can we please stay focused on my problem here?! Y'know?"
218,Chandler," I’m talking about you. You big, big freak."
219,Joey," Oh. (realises) Ohh. Ohh, you’re out of your mind."
220,Chandler," Hey, you have nothing but talk about her for the last 48 hours! If you
were in a school yard you’d be pulling her pigtails and pushing her down now!"
221,Joey," Oh, yeah?! Then how come I keep thinking about her in all these sexual
scenarios and stuff huh?!"
224,Joey," Well, why don’t you tell me what you’re supposed to be! Huh?
Because I sure as hell can’t figure it out! I talk to you and it’s nothin’.
You look at me, and nothin’. (He kisses her, more passionately this time) Nothing."
227,Joey, Better?
229,Joey," Ah, Kate? "
231,Joey," You ah, you forgot your shoes."
233,Joey," Hey, listen you ah...."
235,Joey, ...feel like getting a cup of coffee?
243,Joey," Yeah, yeah sure, goodnight."
245,Phoebe," (to Chandler) Hey! (Chandler looks up, startled) Why isn’t it
Spiderman? Y’know like Goldman, Silverman..."
246,Chandler, ‘Cause it’s-it’s not his last name.
247,Phoebe, It isn’t?
248,Chandler," No, it’s not like, like Phil Spiderman. He’s a spider, man.
Y'know like ah, like Goldman is a last name, but there’s no Gold Man."
249,Phoebe," Oh, okay. There should be Gold Man!"
250,Rachel, (entering) Hey!
251,Monica," Hey, Rach, how was work?"
252,Rachel," Oh, great. Although I did sit down where there wasn’t a chair."
253,Monica," By the way, Ross dropped by a box of your stuff."
254,Rachel," Oh, well, I guess I had that one coming. I’m just gonna throw it
out, it’s probably just a bunch of shampoo and... (she opens the box and stops)"
255,Monica, Something wrong?
256,Rachel," (She takes the T-shirt out of the box and holds it to her chest and take
a deep breath.) No. Nothing. (She smiles and goes into her room.)"
259,Chandler," So, ahh, what kind of powers would Gold Man have?"
260,Phoebe," Okay well, he would turn things to gold."
261,Chandler, What about things that are already gold?
262,Phoebe," Ahh, his work is done."
263,Chandler," Okay, let’s play my game now."
264,Phoebe," Okay. All right you yellow-bellied-lilly-livered-DRAW!! (they both kick
up the foot rests like an old fashioned gun fight.)"
0,Chandler," Wait a minute, wait. You’re telling me this actress person is the
only woman you ever wanted who didn’t want you back?!"
1,Joey, Yeah! Oh my God! (to Chandler) Is this what it’s like to be you?
2,Monica," Wow, you’re really crazy about her, huh?"
3,Joey," Oh, you have no idea. And-and when we’re on stage I get to-to kiss
her and-and touch her, but then she goes home with the director, and it’s like
somebody’s ripping out my heart!"
4,Phoebe," Oh, it’s so great to see you feeling like this!"
5,Ross, (entering) Hey!
7,Ross," Monica, uh Dad called this morning and ah, Aunt Silvia passed away."
8,Monica," Yes!! Yes! Yeah, yeah, yeah!"
9,Ross, We were all pretty shaken up about it.
10,Phoebe," Wait, am I missing something though? ‘Cause I thought death was
something that’s supposed to be sad, in a way."
11,Ross," Well ah, Aunt Silvia was, well not a nice person."
12,Monica," Oh, she was a cruel, cranky, old bitch! (Ross gives her a look) (to
Ross) And I’m sorry she died. Did Dad say I get the dollhouse?"
13,Ross, You get the dollhouse.
14,Monica, I get the dollhouse!
15,Phoebe," Wow, a house for dolls, that is so cool! When I was kid, I had a barrel."
16,Joey," Uh, Pheebs, you had a barrel for a dollhouse?"
17,Phoebe," No, just a barrel."
18,Monica," Y'know what, you can play with my dollhouse."
19,Phoebe, Really?! Really?!
20,Monica," Any time you want. Y'know, when I was younger, all I wanted to do was to
play with this dollhouse, but no!! It was to be looked at, but never played with."
21,Chandler, My Grandmother used to say that exact same thing to me.
24,Rachel," Hey, Sophie!"
26,Chandler, Hey.
28,Rachel," Thanks for lunch, Chandler. Y'know, you didn’t have to walk me all
the way back up here."
29,Chandler," Oh, that’s-that’s okay, no problem. (He starts to look
around her office.)"
30,Rachel," Honey um, honey, you do realise that we don’t keep the women’s
lingerie here in the office?"
31,Chandler," Yes, I realise that."
32,Rachel, Summer catalogue! (hands him the catalogue)
33,Chandler, That’s the stuff! (quickly grabs it)
36,Rachel," (introduces them) Joanna, this is my friend Chandler Bing (to Chandler)
Joanna."
38,Chandler," Thanks, it’s ah, Gaelic, for ‘Thy turkey’s done.’
So ah, I’m gonna go, nice, nice meeting you."
40,Rachel," Bye, Chandler."
42,Rachel," Oh, nothing, he’s just goofy like that, I actually, hardly notice
it anymore."
44,Rachel," No!! No! He’s not married, or involved, with anyone!"
46,Rachel," Well, I’ll ask him for you, if you want me too?"
51,Monica," Look at it! Ohhh! Wallpaper’s a little faded, that’s okay.
Carpet’s a little loose. Hardwood floors!!"
52,Phoebe, (entering) Hey!
53,Chandler, Hello.
54,Phoebe, Oh! Ooh! Oh Monica! It’s so beautiful.
55,Monica, I know!!!
56,Phoebe," So, I’m here, ready to play."
57,Monica, Okay.
58,Phoebe," I brought a bunch of stuff for the house, so check it out. Ha-ha. (She
removes this large ceramic dog that comes up to the second floor and places it next to the
house.)"
59,Monica, What’s this?
60,Phoebe," That’s a dog, every house should have a dog."
61,Monica, Not one that can pee on the roof.
62,Phoebe," Well, maybe it’s so big because the house was built on radioactive
waste."
63,Chandler, (holding a tissue) And is this in case the house sneezes?
64,Phoebe," No, no, that’s the ghost for the attic."
65,Monica, I don’t want a ghost.
66,Phoebe," Well, nobody wants a ghost. But you’ve got one, because the house
is sitting on an ancient Indian burial ground."
67,Ross," Wait a minute, the house was built on radioactive waste, and an ancient
Indian burial ground? That would never happen."
68,Phoebe," Okay, obviously you don’t know much about the U.S. government."
69,Rachel, (entering) Hey!
71,Rachel, I need to talk to you!
72,Ross," Sure, what’s up?"
73,Rachel," Oh, sorry. I meant Chandler."
74,Ross, I-I know. Well if something comes up... (walks away)
75,Chandler," Oh, I'm glad you guys are past that little awkward phase."
76,Rachel," Okay, my boss, Joanna, when you left, she started asking questions about
you..."
77,Chandler," Oh-ho, liked what she saw, huh? Dug my action, did she? Checkin’
out the Chan-Chan man!"
78,Rachel," (looks at him) That was (pause) surreal. Okay, what do think? Are you
interested at all?"
79,Chandler," Yeah, she seemed cool, attractive. I’ll do it."
80,Rachel," Oh thank you, Chandler, this is so great, she’s gonna love me."
81,Phoebe," (holding a dinosaur) Okay, dinosaur attack!! Quick, everybody into the
house!! Ahh-ahh! (the dinosaur starts attacking the house. She starts to bark like a dog.)
Roof! Rrroof-roof-roof!"
82,Monica," Okay, Phoebe, y'know what? That-that’s it, that’s it, all
right? No dinosaurs, no ghosts, no giant dogs, okay? They’re not the right size,
they’re not Victorian, and they just don’t go."
83,Phoebe," Okay, (starts to pack up her stuff) fine. Come dinosaur, we’re not
welcome in the house of no imagination."
84,Ross," Uh, Pheebs, while we’re hovering around the subject. I just have to
say dinosaurs, they-they don’t go, rrroof!"
85,Phoebe, The little ones do.
87,Joey," Hey, Kate!"
89,Joey," Listen, I ah, went to that restaurant that you were talking about last
week..."
91,Joey," (to himself) And I ate the food, I had the fish, it was good, yeah. It was
good, yeah..."
93,Joey," Oh, hey! Joey Tribbiani."
95,Joey," (looks at her, shocked) What?!"
97,Joey," Get out of here, really?!"
99,Joey, Yeah? 
101,Joey, They gave me the shaft all right.
103,Joey," Well Ahh, (he sees Kate and the director kissing) yeah! Yeah, sure, a
drink sounds great."
105,Joey, All right.
108,Phoebe, Hey! 
110,Phoebe," Look everybody, look at my new dollhouse!!"
111,Rachel, Wow!!
112,Phoebe," Look, look! (She lifts up the roof, and the front panel falls revealing
the interior.)"
113,Ross," Hey, what’s this?!"
114,Phoebe," Oh, okay, it’s the slide instead of stairs. Watch this. (She slides
a doll down the slide)"
115,Monica," It’s very interesting, Phoebe."
116,Rachel, What’s this?
117,Phoebe," The Licorice Room, you can eat all the furniture. And, when guests come
over, they can stay on the tootsie roll-away bed."
118,Ross, This is the coolest house ever!!
120,Phoebe," Hey, does anybody want to join me in the aroma room? (lights some
incense)"
121,Rachel, All right!
122,Ross, I would!
123,Monica," Hey, guys, guys, did you see my new, china cabinet?!"
125,Phoebe," Watch, watch. (She turns a strand of Christmas lights strung around the
house.)"
127,Phoebe," And, and! (She turns on a bubble maker.)"
129,Chandler," (entering) Hey, my Father’s house does that!"
130,Rachel," (to Chandler) O-o-o-okay, how did it go? Tell me everything."
131,Chandler," Well, the movie was great, dinner was great, and there’s nothing
like a cool, crisp New York evening. "
132,Rachel, Hmm.
133,Chandler," Of course, I didn’t get to enjoy any of that, because
Joanna’s such a big, dull dud!"
136,Rachel, What?!
138,Rachel," Oh, I...."
140,Rachel," Oh, I know..."
145,Joey," Come on baby, don’t go. Please? What do you say?"
148,Joey, (to Kate) That guy’s like a cartoon. What do you see in him anyway?
150,Joey," Hey, I’m not interested in her sweater! It’s what’s
underneath her sweater that counts. And besides, since ah, since when do you care who
I’m going out with?"
152,Joey, Do you want me to want you to care?
154,Joey, What?
157,Joey," Come on baby, don’t go. Please? What do you say?"
162,Joey," Hey, it’s gonna be all right."
164,Joey, What?
166,Joey," Oh, yeah, with the mug painting. Yeah. I was so listening to that. But ah,
y'know what, I think I kinda need to work on my stuff tonight."
168,Joey, Okay. (he gives her a peck on the cheek)
170,Joey, Okay.
172,Joey," (to Kate) Ah, are you okay?"
174,Joey, I don’t know.
176,Joey, How do you mean?
178,Joey, Maybe he could slip her the tongue.
180,Joey," Yeah, yeah, and then Adrian, she maybe she could wrap her legs around his
waist."
182,Joey," And then, then he could use his teeth, his teeth to undo her dress, and,
and, and bite her!"
185,Joey, Something like that?
187,Joey, Yeah.
190,Joey, (to Ross) Hey.
191,Ross, Hi.
192,Joey, (to Monica) Hey. 
194,Ross, Hi.
195,Joey, Hey.
197,Ross, It’s a little early to be drinkin’.
198,Joey," No-no, things ah, finally happened with Kate."
199,Ross, Ohhhhh!
200,Monica, You’re kidding?! That’s great!
201,Joey," Oh, it was so amazing. After the (pause) love making..."
202,Monica, Oh my.
203,Joey," Yep. I just, I just watched her sleep for like hours, just breathing in
and breathing out. And then I knew she was dreaming ‘cause, ‘cause her eyes keep
going like this. (He closes his eyes and moves them around, kinda like he’s been
processed by the devil, or something.)"
204,Chandler," (entering with Rachel) I’m telling ya, Joanna’s got it all
wrong. Okay? All I said was, ‘This was fun. Let’s do it again sometime.
I’ll give you a call.’"
205,Rachel," Ohh, gee. I wonder why she thinks you’re going to call her?"
206,Chandler, That’s what you say at the end of a date.
207,Rachel," You can’t just say, ‘Nice to meet you, good night?’"
208,Chandler," To her face? Look it’s the end of the date, I’m standing
there, I know all she’s waiting for is for me to say ‘I’ll call her’
and it’s just y'know, comes out. I can’t help it, it’s a compulsion."
209,Monica," Come on Rach, when a guy says he’s going to call, it doesn’t
mean he’s going to call. Hasn’t it ever happened to you?"
210,Rachel," Well, they always called."
211,Monica," Hmm, bite me."
214,Rachel, No. Sorry.
218,Rachel," Okay, okay. Umm, well ah, maybe he, maybe he feels awkward because you
are my boss."
220,Rachel, Well...
222,Rachel, No. I...
225,Rachel, (grabbing the magazine out of his hands) Call her! Call her now!
226,Chandler," Multiple, so many paper cuts."
227,Rachel," Why hasn’t he called Rachel? Why? Why? I don’t understand.
Why? He said he’ll call. Why? Why? Chandler I’m telling you she has flipped out,
she’s gone crazy!"
228,Chandler," (sarcastic) Oh, well give me the phone then."
229,Rachel," Come on, this isn’t funny. She thinks it’s my fault that you
haven’t called her. You have to call her!"
230,Chandler," Look, you can’t call somebody after this long just to say,
‘In case you didn’t notice, I don’t like you!’"
231,Rachel, Well then you’re going to have to take her out again.
232,Chandler," Nooo!! She’s really dull! And she gets this gross mascara goop
thing in the corner of her eye!"
233,Rachel," I don’t care! I don’t care! You are going to have to take her
out again and end it, and end it in way that she knows it’s actually ended. And, I
don’t care how hard it is for you, do not tell her that you will call her again!"
234,Chandler," All right! Fine! But it’s just a lunch date, no more than an
hour! And from now on I get my own dates, I don’t want you setting me up with anybody
ever again!"
235,Rachel, That’s fine!
236,Chandler," That’s just a lot of big talk, y'know."
237,Rachel, I know.
239,Ross, Mon?
240,Monica, (from the bathroom) I’m in the shower!
242,Ross," Oh, fire! There, there’s a fire! Fire!!"
245,Joey, Hey.
247,Joey," So I ah, talked to Lauren, kinda told her how things were with us. Did you
ah, did you talk to Marshall?"
249,Joey," Y'know, about what happened with us."
251,Joey," What are you talking about? It was a big deal. I mean, come on you
can’t tell me last night didn’t mean something to you. I-I was there,
you’re not that good an actress."
253,Joey, Nooo.
256,Joey," Hi, Lauren."
259,Ross," Sorry I ah, I scared you in there."
260,Monica," Oh, that’s okay. By the way, I was just checking the shower
massager."
261,Ross, Yeah.
262,Phoebe, (entering) Hey!
263,Monica," (runs over to her) I tried to reach you at work. There’s....been a
fire."
264,Phoebe," What?! Oh my... (sees the remains of the house) Oh my God!! What
happened?!"
265,Ross," Well, we believe it originated here. (He uses a pointer and points to the
point of origin.) In the Aroma Room."
266,Phoebe, All right. Did everyone get out okay?
267,Monica," Well, the giraffe’s okay. And so is the pirate."
268,Phoebe," Ohh. What is this? (She sees a tissue covering something, and moves to
remove it.)"
269,Ross," No Phoebe, don’t look! You don’t want to see what’s under
there!!"
270,Phoebe," (She pauses to ready herself, and removes the tissue.) Ohh, the-the
Foster puppets! "
273,Chandler," It’s not a big deal. It’s, just it’s right here,
(points to his eye) and it’s all the time."
275,Chandler," (He looks over at Rachel, who nods her head) Yes, this, this was
pleasant."
278,Chandler," The food there was, was great."
280,Chandler, So take care.
282,Chandler," Well, this was great. I’ll give you a call. We should do it again
sometime. (Rachel is disappointed) "
284,Rachel, Sophie’s desk.
286,Rachel, (whispering) Chandler!! Are you gonna call her!
287,Chandler, Noo! 
288,Rachel, Chandler!!
289,Chandler," Look, I’m sorry. Okay? I’m weak, and pathetic, and sorry."
290,Rachel," Okay, you are going to tell her and you’re going to tell her now.
(She grabs his nipple and starts to twist it.)"
291,Chandler, Ahhhh—I’m not going to call you.
293,Chandler," I’m sorry. I’m-I’m-I’m sorry that I said I was
going to when I’m not. Look, this has nothing to do with you, y'know? And this
isn’t Rachel’s fault. It’s me. I have serious, serious problems when it
comes to women. I have issues with commitment, intimacy, (pause) mascara goop. And
I’m really sorry, it’s just that this is not, this isn’t going to work out."
295,Chandler," Yeah, o-okay."
297,Chandler," Well this is great! I’ll give you a call! We should do it again
sometime!"
301,Joey," (on phone) Well, so anyway Beth, what I’m saying is I should’ve
considered your feelings before I went home with you that night. I’ve ah, I’ve
recently learned what’s it like to be on your side of it, and I’m sorry. So, do
you think you can forgive me? (listens) Great. Thanks. Okay, bye. (He sits down and
crosses out something, and dials the phone again.) Hello, Jennifer? (listens) Oh hi, Mrs.
Loreo, is Jennifer there? (listens) Oh, she’s not home huh? (listens) Well ah,
actually I kinda need to talk to you too."
0,Rachel, So who’s idea was it to put everybody in the diner on skates?
1,Monica," Oh, some idiot customer put a suggestion in the suggestion box."
2,Phoebe," Oh my God, they took my idea!"
3,Monica, That was you?!
4,Phoebe," Yeah! Okay, here you go. (rolls her back to Rachel)"
7,Phoebe," Oh my God, are you guys okay?"
9,Joey," (leaving Central Perk and seeing Monica laying on top of Rachel who is
moaning in pain.) Oh my."
13,Chandler, (sporting a goatee) Hey.
14,Joey, Hey. Y'know with that goatee you kinda look like Satan.
15,Chandler," Oh, so that’s why the priest threw holy water on me.
(there’s no reaction from Joey) Okay, listen, you have to cheer up! Okay? You
should come out with Ross and me, I mean anything is better than sitting around here
crying all day about Kate."
16,Joey," Hey I was crying because, because nobody believed Quincy’s theory.
Okay?"
17,Ross, (entering) Hey!
18,Chandler, Hey.
19,Ross, (triumphantly) I’m gonna be on TV!!
20,Chandler, No way!
21,Ross," Yeah! They’re putting together this panel to talk about these fossils
they just found in Peru and The Discovery Channel’s gonna film it!"
22,Chandler, Oh my God! Who’s gonna watch that?!
23,Ross, Thanks. You ready to go?
24,Chandler, Yeah. (they start to leave)
25,Joey, Saw a girl with that vest.
26,Chandler, Thanks. (He takes off the vest and throws it on the floor.)
28,Joey," (on phone) Yeah, hi. You guys got any of those baby chicks? ‘Cause I
was watching this ah, commercial on TV and man, those guys are cute!"
31,Monica," Hi! Hey, Pete you’re back! Hey, check this out. (She starts to
skate over to him)"
34,Monica," Wow! You’re a lot sturdier that Chandler. He crumpled like a piece
of paper. So how was you’re trip?"
36,Monica," Oh, what’d ya bring me?! (She opens the gift) Awww, hotel
toiletries from Japan. Oh, these are gonna go in my permanent collection. You want some
coffee?"
39,Monica, (popping back up) Regular or decaf?
41,Monica, Okay. (hands him a cup)
43,Monica, So what did you do today Pete?
45,Monica, What?! Oh.(She turns around quickly and falls)
47,Monica, Can you believe he just offered me a restaurant?
48,Rachel, What a jerk! You want me to kick his ass?
49,Monica," I mean this has been like my dream since I got my first Easy Bake Oven
and opened Easy Monica’s Bakery. I mean I would kill for this job. I mean I can
totally do this job, and God knows I paid my dues. (She removes her fake breasts) But
Pete’s just doing this because he has a crush on me."
50,Rachel, And you’re still not attracted to him at all?
51,Monica," Hmm, no. I mean how can I accept a restaurant from him? I-I-I-I
can’t. I couldn’t even accept a necklace from Stu Vincent in the seventh grade."
52,Rachel," Yeah, but Mon that’s totally different. He was you’re health
teacher."
53,Monica," Oh, please. "
55,Monica, What? Honey.
56,Rachel," Oh, I am, my side still hurts from when you crashed into me yesterday."
57,Monica," Oh God, I’m so sorry."
58,Rachel, I know. 
60,Rachel, Ow!!
61,Monica, Oh God!
62,Ross," (entering, wearing a white suit with a little red bow tie) Hey, you guys!
Guess what?"
63,Rachel, (looking at the outfit) Got a job on a river boat?
64,Ross," Y'know what I didn’t wear this suit for a year because you hated it.
Well, guess what? You’re not my girlfriend anymore so..."
65,Rachel," Oh I see, so this suit is making a point."
66,Ross, Right.
67,Rachel," Now that you’re on you’re own, you’re free to look as
stupid as you like."
68,Ross, (to Monica) You like it right?
69,Monica," Oh absolutely. I like it even more on you than I did on Colonel Sanders.
(Ross starts to leave) Ross! Ross! I’m kidding!"
70,Rachel," Yeah, come here!"
71,Monica, What-what was it you were gonna tell us? 
72,Rachel, Yeah. Oh! Was how you invented the cotton gin?!
73,Ross," Okay, good bye! (leaves)"
75,Chandler," So um, after you put the suggestion in the box, how long did it take
for the roller skating thing to happen."
76,Phoebe," Umm, oh, about three months."
77,Chandler," Okay, so I guess that’s about ah, two weeks before the topless
thing kicks in."
78,Joey, (entering carrying a box) Hey!!
79,Chandler, Hey!
80,Joey, I got you something! Open it! Open it!
81,Chandler, Okay. (He opens it and it’s a baby chick) It’s a chicken.
82,Joey," It’s cute, huh?"
83,Phoebe," Whoa-whoa-whoa, you guys, do you know anything about chicks?"
84,Chandler, Fowl? No. Women? Nooo.
85,Phoebe," Okay, well they are a huge responsibility, especially at this age. They
require constant care. They-they need just the right food, and lot’s and lot’s
of love."
86,Joey," Oh, well no problem there. (He picks up the chick, hugs it really tight,
and talks to it like it’s a little baby.)"
87,Chandler, Easy Lenny.
90,Monica, Okay. Here’s the thing.
92,Monica," I can’t do it. I’m sorry, I wish I could, but umm, see you
have these feelings for me...."
94,Monica, Huh?
96,Monica, Oh?
98,Monica," Oh, that’s great! I mean I’m-I’m sorry, but I’m so
happy for you. And now I can work for you!"
100,Monica," Oh my God! Oh, this is incredible! Ohh! (she rolls over and kisses him
on the cheek) All right, y'know what? I’m just gonna roll right into that office
and-and quit!"
102,Monica, Okay. (she gets ready to go) Can you give me a little push?
104,Monica," (rolling towards the office) I’m quitting!! Woo-hoo! (She rolls
through a doorway and out of sight. We then hear a big crash, and see Monica roll past the
door the other way.) I’m okay!! I’m all right!!"
105,Phoebe," (to Pete) Wow! That’s exciting, you went to Japan, made up a woman."
107,Phoebe," I’m just saying, this woman, I mean she’s fictitious. No?"
109,Phoebe," ‘Cause you’re still into Monica. So you told her there was
somebody else so she would agree to work with you, so ‘cause you figure oh if you
spent a lot of time together, maybe something might happen, and..."
111,Phoebe," Yeah, no, I’m fairly intuitive and psychic. It’s a substantial
gift."
113,Phoebe," Absolutely, oh I promise. Tell her what?"
115,Phoebe," No I’m serious. I mean I’m intuitive, but my memory sucks."
117,Chandler," Okay, but this is the last time. (singing) With a chick-chick here,
and a chick-chick there. Here a chick, there a chick, everywhere a chick-chick-(Joey
enters)-chickeeeen."
118,Joey, Hey.
119,Chandler, Hey.
120,Joey, How’s she doing?
121,Chandler, She?
122,Joey," Well yeah, don’t-don’t you think it’s a she?"
123,Chandler," I don’t know. (He picks the chick up and turns it over, trying to
determine the sex of the chick, and blows on it.) I can’t tell, what ever it was went
back in too quickly."
124,Joey," Well, anyway, I got to go change, I’m ah, meeting some of the cast
for drinks."
125,Chandler, Excuse me?
126,Joey, What?
127,Chandler," I stayed home from work today while you were at rehearsal so somebody
could be here with our chick!"
128,Joey," Hey! Who was up from 2 o’clock this morning until 5 o’clock this
morning trying to get her back to sleep?"
129,Chandler, You don’t think I get up when you get up?
130,Joey," Ohhh, here it comes."
131,Chandler," Yes, here it comes! I’m stuck here all day, and then you come in
and spend two seconds with us and then expect to go off gallivanting with your friends?
Well I don’t think so mister!"
132,Joey, Hey!! I need to relax! Okay? I was working all day!
133,Chandler, And you don’t think taking care of our chick is work?
134,Joey," That’s not what I said. Okay, I just meant..."
135,Chandler," I know what you meant!! (pause) You notice that ever since we got this
chick, we’ve been fighting a lot more than we used too?"
136,Joey," I don’t know, maybe we weren’t ready to have a chick."
137,Chandler, I’ll take her back tomorrow.
138,Joey, Do you think we’ll get our three bucks back?
139,Ross, (entering carrying a garment bag) Hey!
140,Chandler, Hey!
141,Ross," (sees the chick) Ohhh, hey! All right, listen, I-I have that TV thing in
like two hours, and I need your help, okay? What do you think? (takes out two suits) This
blue suit, or this brown one?"
142,Joey," Well, the brown one brings out your eyes, but your butt looks great in the
blue one."
143,Ross, Really? (Joey gives him a ‘Like I would know’ look)
145,Rachel," (she reaches for the bottle) Oww! (She grabs the bottle, but has trouble
opening it. She pops the top off and aspirins fly all over the place as Ross enters.)"
146,Ross, Wow! That aspirin dance really works!
147,Rachel, (She bends over to try and pick up the aspirin) Oww!
148,Ross," Oh my God, is that still..."
149,Rachel," I’m fine, I’m fine."
150,Ross, No you’re not.
151,Rachel, Yes I am! 
152,Ross, Rach!
153,Rachel," Look, I’m fine. Watch. (She picks up an aspirin between her toes)
Look at that. (She lifts her leg to grab the aspirin with her hand and almost falls over.)
Whoa-whoa!"
154,Ross," (stopping her from falling) Okay, okay. Look, you have got to go to a
doctor! Okay?"
155,Rachel," No. I have got to get ready and go to a dinner at my bosses
house. It’s a very big deal, there’s a lot of people there I have to meet."
156,Ross," And I’m sure you’re gonna make a big impression. Hi! I’m
Rachel Green. It’s nice to meet you. (He lifts his leg and imitates shaking hands
with it, just like how Rachel was trying to pick up the aspirin with her feet.) Come on,
you probably have a broken rib!"
157,Rachel," Well, I will go to the hospital tomorrow, it’ll still be broken
then."
158,Ross, Rach...
159,Rachel," But y'know, I could use a hand getting ready."
160,Ross, Rachel...
161,Rachel," Look, either help me or go."
162,Ross, Fine. I’ll go.
163,Rachel," (with a hurt expression on her face) Okay, but before you go, could you
help me first?"
164,Ross, (He checks his watch) Sure. I’ll help you.
165,Chandler," (rushing in) Oh, good! Good! Do you guys know how to get a chick out
of a VCR?!"
168,Rachel," (She drops the brush) Y'know what? I cannot do this with my left hand!
Would you please, help me with this too?"
169,Ross," Ohh. (He drops the shoes, takes the brush from her, and licks the tip. He
doesn’t like how it tastes.)"
170,Rachel," (taking the brush back) Okay. Let’s use this brush. (Hands him
another one.)"
171,Ross, Okay. This stuff? 
172,Rachel, Yeah.
173,Ross, All right.
174,Rachel," Careful. Light. Okay, do you know how, just sweep it across the lid.
Okay? Just sweep it."
175,Ross, Oke-dokey. (He pokes her in the eye with the brush.)
176,Rachel, Oh-ho!
177,Ross, Sorry.
178,Rachel, Hey! That’s just poking me in the eye!
179,Ross," Sorry, I’m sorry. Close, close, close..."
180,Rachel," Okay, just sweep it."
181,Ross, I’m sweeping...
182,Rachel, Right.
183,Ross," Sweep, sweep....(He starts to paint it on her eye, making it look like she
has a black eye.)"
184,Rachel," Okay, now make it even, ‘cause we don’t..."
185,Ross, What? What?
186,Rachel," We don’t want it-it to be too much, we want it to be subtle."
188,Ross," No. No, y'know you don’t, you don’t wear enough of this. (Rachel
is shocked) What?"
189,Rachel," Since when, since when do you think I don’t wear enough of this?"
190,Ross," Well I, close your eyes, I just think you’re gonna like this a little
better, ‘cause, close-close... (He gets some more on the brush)"
191,Rachel, Blow it.
192,Ross," (blows it) Sorry. ‘Cause umm, I think this will make you a little
more sophisticated."
193,Rachel, Sophisticated like a hooker?
195,Monica, Hey!
196,Phoebe, Hey! 
197,Monica," Hey, guess what I’m doing tonight."
198,Phoebe, What?
199,Monica, I’m checking out the restaurant with Pete.
200,Phoebe," Ohh, Monica, I am so excited for you."
201,Monica, I know.
202,Phoebe," Ooh, I have to tell you something."
203,Monica, What?
204,Phoebe, But I can’t tell you.
205,Monica," Okay, but wouldn’t it be easier if you had to tell me something
that you could tell me."
206,Phoebe," Well, sure in a perfect world. But, no, I promised I wouldn’t tell,
and I swore to like all my gods."
207,Monica, Okay. Does it have to do with Ross and Rachel?
208,Phoebe, No.
209,Monica, Does it have to do with Joey?
210,Phoebe, No.
211,Monica," Does it have to do with-with Chandler and that sock that he keeps by his
bed?"
212,Phoebe," No, but let’s come back to that later!"
214,Ross," There you go! Good enough for your party, huh?"
216,Rachel, Sure.
217,Ross, Yep?
218,Rachel," Sure, I’ll just sit next to the trans-sexual from purchasing."
219,Ross," Okay, come on! All right, I gotta go! So good luck at the party. Okay?"
220,Rachel," Oh wait, Ross, would you just stay and help me get dressed?"
221,Ross," (checks his watch) Sure, okay."
222,Rachel," Okay. Okay, great! Umm, okay, just turn around."
223,Ross, What?
224,Rachel, I don’t want you to see me naked!
225,Ross," Rachel, I’ve seen you naked a million times. I ate hot fudge off you
naked. Remember, I-I sucked that mini-marshmallow out of your belly button?"
226,Rachel," Yeah, but that was different. Y’know? I mean, we were, we were
going out then, now I think it’s weird."
227,Ross," Rach, y'know I can see you naked any time I want."
228,Rachel, What?
229,Ross, All I have to do is close my eyes. See? (closes his eyes) Woo-hoo!!
230,Rachel, Ross! Stop that!
231,Ross," Ah, I’m sorry."
232,Rachel, Come on! I don’t want you thinking of me like that any more!
233,Ross," Ahh, sorry, nothing you can do about it. It’s one of my ah, rights as
the ex-boyfriend. (closes his eyes again) Oop, oh yeah!"
234,Rachel, Stop it! Cut it out! Cut it out!
235,Ross," Okay, okay, I’m sorry, it will never happen... (closes eyes) Uh-oh!
Wait a minute! Wait-wait, now there are a hundred of you and I’m the king. "
236,Rachel, Rosss...
237,Ross," Come on, would you grow up? It’s no big deal."
238,Rachel, All right. (She starts to take off her robe) Fine.
239,Ross, Yowzah!!!
240,Rachel," O-kay!! See what you did, I’m gonna be doing it by myself now.
Okay? "
241,Ross," Aww, come on."
242,Rachel, That’s it. (She crawls onto the bed) Ow!!! 
243,Ross, Oh my God!
244,Rachel, Oh-ow!
245,Ross, All right.
246,Rachel, Ow!
247,Ross, Look...
248,Rachel, Ow!
249,Ross, Okay.
250,Rachel, Ow!
251,Ross, Rach?
252,Rachel, Ow! Ow!
253,Ross, Easy. Easy. You have to go to the hospital. Okay?
254,Rachel," Okay, I do. "
255,Ross, Okay.
256,Rachel, I really do.
257,Ross," Okay, I’m gonna get your coat and then I’ll-I’ll put you in
a cab."
258,Rachel," Okay. Oh wait, wait-wait, you’re not gonna come with me?"
259,Ross, (He thinks about it) Of course I am. I just have to make a call.
260,Rachel, Okay.
261,Ross, Okay? (goes into the living room)
262,Rachel," Thank you. (She goes to take off her make-up and screams in pain)
Oww!!!! God!"
263,Ross," (rushing back in) What?! I wh-, what’s wrong?"
264,Rachel," I’m sorry, I just can’t go to the hospital lookin’ like
this."
266,Monica, Does it involve travel?
267,Phoebe, Noo!
268,Monica, Does it involve clogs?
269,Phoebe," Oh, wait, wait. Clogs, or claws?"
270,Monica, Clogs.
271,Phoebe, No.
272,Monica, Claws?!
273,Phoebe, No.
274,Monica," Okay, so it doesn’t involve Ross or Rachel or Chandler or Joey.
But, what about Pete?"
275,Phoebe, (Shaking her head yes) No!
276,Monica, What is it?! What about Pete?
277,Phoebe, I don’t know! (frantically points at Monica)
278,Monica," Okay, I feel like I’m talking to Lassie. All right, Phoebe would
you just tell me!"
279,Phoebe, I can’t!!
280,Monica," Okay, I gotta go. (gets up)"
281,Phoebe," I, but you’re so close! No!"
282,Monica," Okay, does it involve something to do with Pete’s computer company?"
283,Phoebe," Oh, just go. You’re never gonna get it!"
285,Chandler," I know. See, yes. That’s Yasmine Bleeth, she’s a completely
different kind of chick. I love you both. But in very different ways."
286,Joey, (entering) Hey!
287,Chandler, Hey!
288,Joey," (sees he’s watching Baywatch) Ohhh. (sees he still has the
chick) Ahh! What are you doing?! I thought you were gonna take her back to the store
today."
289,Chandler," I did! But the store wouldn’t take her back! So then I took her
to the shelter, and you know what I found out? "
291,Chandler," If they can’t find a home for her, they kill her! And I’m
not gonna let that happen to little Yasmine!"
292,Joey," Okay, good, good, good, ‘cause, good, ‘cause I was kinda having
second thoughts too. "
293,Chandler," Okay. And it’s not just chicks y'know? It’s all kinds of
other animals!"
294,Joey," That’s horrible! Well, you did the right thing man."
295,Chandler," Thanks, I’m glad you see it that way."
297,Chandler," Ohhh-hoo, funny story!"
299,Monica," I don’t believe this! Wow, look at this refrigerator! It’s
gigantic! I mean I could live in this thing! I’d be cold, but I’m always cold.
Oh my God, look at these spider burners! I love spider burners."
301,Monica," Oh, it is sooo perfect. Thank you so much. (runs over and hugs him)"
303,Monica, Did you just smell my hair?
305,Monica, Oh God.
307,Monica, You still have feelings for me don’t you?
309,Monica, Pete.
311,Monica," No, it’s not bad. It’s not bad at all. It’s-it’s
really nice."
313,Monica," You may be okay about getting hurt, but I am not okay with being the one
who hurts you. That’s why I can’t take this job."
315,Monica," And well, we probably shouldn’t see each other anymore. I’m
sorry."
317,Monica," Okay, bye. "
320,Monica," All right shut up for a second and let me just see something. (She
kisses him back on the lips) Oh, wow! (They then hug and kiss, very passionately.)"
322,Rachel," Okay, you’d tell me the truth. Right?"
323,Ross," Rach, you can’t look fat in an x-ray."
324,Rachel, Okay.
326,Chandler," Okay! Now you stay out here, and you think about what you did!!"
327,Ross, (to Chandler) That’s a duck.
328,Chandler," That’s a bad duck!!! (to Ross) How’d the thing go tonight,
Ross?"
329,Ross," Oh, it was, nah, well...."
330,Rachel, What thing? What thing?
331,Ross," Nothing, ah there was this thing at the museum. Come on. (they go into her
apartment) Easy."
332,Chandler," (to the duck) Okay, now when you come back I hope you remember that,
that chick is not a toy! (He goes back into the apartment)"
334,Rachel, What thing? What is this thing?
335,Ross," I was kinda, supposed to be on TV tonight for The Discovery Channel."
336,Rachel, Oh my God! 
337,Ross, Yeah.
338,Rachel," Ross, why didn’t you tell me that?"
339,Ross," Eh, ‘cause I knew that if I told you, you’d make me go, and I
knew you needed someone to be with you tonight. Come on. Come on."
340,Rachel, I cannot believe you.
341,Ross, What?
342,Rachel," That is the sweetest thing, I just...."
344,Ross, (breaking the silence) You should get some sleep.
345,Rachel, Okay.
346,Ross," So, I’ll umm..."
347,Rachel," Oh, I’m sorry I spoiled you’re evening."
348,Ross," No, that’s, no, as long as you’re okay. So I’ll ah,
I’ll see you tomorrow."
349,Rachel," Um-hmm, yeah."
351,Rachel, (After he closes the door) See ya.
353,Chandler, (coming out of his apartment and seeing Ross) What did you do?
356,Joey, What ‘cha doing?
357,Chandler, Having a swim.
358,Joey, What about the chick?
359,Chandler, Chicks don’t swim.
360,Joey, Are you sure?
361,Chandler, I don’t know. Should we try it?
362,Joey, Sure.
364,Chandler," See, I told you they don’t swim. (He goes to take it out)"
365,Joey, (stopping him) Wait. Give him a minute.
366,Chandler," Noo! (takes him out) Oh, it’s okay, it’s okay, baby, baby,
baby."
0,Rachel," Oh, Phoebe, are you still on hold? I was supposed to call my Dad back
like two hours ago."
1,Phoebe," Oh, yeah, he clipped on, he said call him as soon as you get a chance,
he’s at Flimby’s."
2,Rachel, What’s Flimby’s?
3,Phoebe," Oh, yeah, that’s the word I use when I can’t remember the real
thing."
4,Rachel, Okay. Hang up! That’s it! Come on!
5,Phoebe," No! Rachel, that’s what they want me to do. My warranty expires
tomorrow, if I don’t get through, they’re not gonna fix my crappy, broken phone
for free! We cannot let them win! It’s us versus them!"
6,Chandler, Ye-e-es!!
7,Joey, (entering) Hey.
9,Joey," Uh, listen I gotta double check for tickets tonight. Who-who got what?"
11,Monica," I need two. I’m bringing Pete. My boyfriend. I have a boyfriend
now!"
12,Joey," Two it is. Ross, how about you?"
13,Ross," Uh, yeah, I ah, I also need two."
14,Monica, Really? Who’s number two?
15,Chandler," Who’s number two? One of the more difficult games sewer workers
play."
16,Ross," Uh, no, it’s-it’s just this person."
17,Phoebe, Like a date type (looks at Rachel) person?
18,Ross," Yeah, kinda. It’s this woman from work. I hope that won’t be too
weird. Will it, Rach?"
19,Rachel," No. No, not at all, not at all. I actually was gonna bring someone
myself, so…"
20,Joey, But you said one.
21,Rachel," I meant, me plus one!"
22,Joey," Okay. (to Phoebe and Chandler) Did ah, you guys mean you plus one?"
23,Ross," All right, I’ll see you tonight."
24,Joey, Okay.
25,Rachel," Okay, bye-bye!"
26,Chandler, Bye!
27,Monica, Bye-bye!
29,Rachel," Okay, I need a date! (runs to her bedroom)"
30,Joey," Oh, hey, you guys are finally gonna get to meet Kate!"
32,Joey," (to Chandler) And I ah, borrowed some of your cologne. I hope she likes
it."
33,Monica," Joey, what are you doing?! It’s never gonna happen, she’s
seeing somebody."
34,Chandler," Yeah, and I don’t have any cologne."
35,Joey, The green bottle next to the shaving cream.
36,Chandler, Oh! Worm medicine for the duck.
40,Monica, (to Phoebe) Here you go. You can wear this. (hands her a sweater)
41,Phoebe, Thanks!
42,Monica, Uh-huh.
43,Phoebe," Okay. (on phone) Ooh, I’m setting the phone down. (does so) But
I’m still here! Just don’t go anywhere I’m still here. (starts to put on
the sweater) Don’t-don’t switch or anything, ‘cause I’m, I’m
right here. (She has pulled the sweater over her head, but her head is stuck in a sleeve.)
Just one sec. One sec! One second!! (She is now frantically trying to get the sweater on,
as Monica returns from the bathroom.) Wait! One second! Just…"
44,Monica, Phoebe?
45,Phoebe," What?! Monica, I’m scared!!"
46,Monica," All right. Honey, that’s-that’s a sleeve. Okay? "
47,Phoebe, Yeah.
48,Monica, And! We also have speaker phone. (She turns on the speaker phone.)
50,Monica," Okay, wait, you gotta hang up ‘cause we’re gonna be late."
53,Phoebe, Yes!! Yes!! I’m the next caller! You were gonna have me hang up.
54,Chandler," (entering, carrying the chick and duck) Hey! Can you take a duck and a
chick to the theatre? "
55,Monica, Of course not.
56,Phoebe, No.
57,Chandler, Okay. I just wanted them to hear it from somebody else.
59,Ross," Hey, hey Rach!"
60,Rachel," Oh, hi!"
61,Ross, Hi!
62,Rachel," How are you? (She goes to kiss him on the cheek, but stops because of
the dates and pats him on the shoulder.)"
63,Ross, Good.
64,Rachel, Hey.
65,Ross, So it’s looks like we’re the first ones here.
66,Rachel," Yeah, looks that way. First ones here! Wooo!!"
67,Ross, Yay!!
69,Rachel," Oh! Tommy, this is Ross. Ross, Tommy."
71,Ross," Hey. Oh, I’m sorry, this is Cailin."
73,Ross, And! Break!!
75,Rachel," Okay, uhh, I think I’m going to run to the ladies room."
79,Ross," Okay. (The girls leave.) (to Tommy) So uh, well, this-this is uh, this is
awkward."
81,Ross, Well y'know ‘cause Rachel and I used to go out.
83,Ross, Oh! Well then this is awkward. So what do you uh…
85,Ross, Oh! Yeah. 
87,Ross," Okay. (sees two people sitting in their seats.) Uh, huh. Excuse me,
I’m sorry, I-I think you may be in our seats."
91,Ross," (looking at ticket) Yep! Yeah, see this says D-13, and uh…"
96,Ross," No, I’m good. (He sits down, stunned.)"
98,Chandler, (seeing Joey) There he is!
99,Monica, There’s our star!
100,Joey," So, so, what’d ya think?"
101,Chandler, Almost as good as that play with the two naked girls on the see-saw.
102,Joey, I-I wasn’t in that.
103,Chandler, I know.
104,Joey," (sees Kate) Oh-oh, hey-hey, Kate! Listen I want you to meet everybody.
Everybody, this is Kate."
105,Monica, Hi!
107,Chandler, So that’s the girl you like.
108,Joey, Yeah.
109,Ross," (drags Chandler over to buffet table) I’m telling you, this guy
Rachel is with is crazy! Okay? He viscously screamed at total strangers! I think he’s
baaad news!"
110,Chandler," Wait a minute, wait a minute, you don’t like the guy
Rachel’s dating? Well, that’s odd."
112,Joey," Oh, hey, Lauren. Uh, you guys this is, this is Kate’s understudy,
Lauren."
113,Rachel," Oh, hi!"
115,Rachel," Hey. Gosh, you look soo familiar."
120,Monica," Yeah, and in the long version, I dump him for telling people the short
version."
123,Joey," Hey you guys, this is my agent, Estelle."
125,Joey," No, they-they weren’t in the play."
126,Rachel, We’re not actors.
128,Chandler, Could I borrow it?
131,Ross," Hi! Yeah! Tommy’s in line for the bathroom and someone just cut in
front of him, I think he’s gonna snap. (He’s watching very intently)"
133,Ross, Go? Why?
135,Ross," But-but Cailin, he definitely will scream."
137,Ross," Uh, oh-ho bye."
139,Joey, Yes!!! Ha-ha-ha!
142,Joey, Anyone mind if I save this?
144,Monica, Hey!
145,Rachel, Hey!
146,Phoebe," Oh, is the play over?"
147,Monica, Yeah. Where were you?
149,Monica, You were the next caller five hours ago. You must be going crazy.
150,Phoebe, Nah. I kept myself busy.
152,Phoebe," Oh, okay, yeah. (to Monica) I put your stuff in her room, and her stuff
in your room."
155,Joey, Hey! Are you okay?
157,Joey," Listen, drama critics they’re nothing but, but people who
couldn’t make it as actors. You know what you should do?"
161,Joey," Oh, classy. "
163,Joey," Wow! Yeah I ah, I gave up a job too."
165,Joey," Uh, de-clawing cats. Hey, tell ya what. Let me walk you home. We’ll
stop by every news stand and burn every copy of their Times and the Post."
167,Joey," Oh, you didn’t see the Post?"
169,Joey, No. Why?
172,Joey," Oh, absolutely! You’re talented and you’re good looking."
174,Joey, I know! That’s why they trashed me!
176,Joey," Whoa. Wait a minute, wait a minute."
178,Joey," I, I don’t get you. I mean first, you hate me. Then you sleep with
me. Then you want nothing to do with me, now you want me again."
180,Joey," Kate, do you even like me?"
182,Joey," Well so, how come you blew me off? Y'know? How come you were with him?"
184,Joey, Thanks.
186,Joey," (Checks to see if she’s drooling on his shirt.) Okay. Okay, okay,
hey. (Lays her down and covers her with a blanket.) There we go, let’s get your feet
up there. (Looks at her) Good night, Kate. Sweet dreams. (Picks up a garbage can) I’m
gonna put this can right here in case you have to hurl."
190,Monica," (entering from her bedroom) Pheebs, you’ve been up for 24 hours! Go
to sleep, honey. Th-this isn’t healthy."
191,Phoebe," No, no, I’m fine, and y’know why? ‘Cause of all the
riboflavin."
192,Joey," (entering, happily) Hey!"
193,Monica, Hey! Didn’t you have that outfit on last night?
194,Joey," Yeah! I stayed at Kate’s, but ah, nothing happened. Hey, Pheebs,
where were ya?"
195,Phoebe," I’m so, so, so sorry, Joey. I definitely am gonna see you’re
play. I swear you’re play is very important to us, thank you for your patience.
You’re play is the next play is the next play I’m gonna see."
196,Monica," Anyway, how did it go with Kate?"
197,Joey," Oh, it was great! Yeah, I-I walked her home, and it was amazing how much
we connected, y'know? Then ah, then she passed out, but then she woke up. Yeah? And we
stayed up all night talking, and now we’re like totally crazy about each other!"
198,Monica," Joey, you had the night! "
199,Joey, What?
200,Monica," When two people finally realise their feelings for each other, and-and
they talk for hours, and they-they learn all about the other person!"
201,Joey, You-you think?
202,Monica, Did you like learn about her family?
203,Joey," Two brothers, one died!"
204,Monica, Yes!!
205,Joey, Yeah?!
206,Monica," Oh! (They hug, triumphantly.)"
209,Chandler, Oh-ho-ho-ho. 
212,Rachel, What time is it?
213,Monica, One.
214,Ross, One.
215,Chandler, 715. (Monica looks at him) Watch doesn’t work.
216,Rachel," Tommy’s supposed to be here soon, we’re going to lunch."
217,Ross," Look. Look, I wasn’t going to say anything to you, but... All right,
I don’t think you should be seeing Tommy anymore."
218,Rachel, You don’t?!
219,Ross," No! The guy is mean. I mean really mean. I think you should stay away from
him."
220,Rachel," Umm, or, maybe, I should stay away from all men."
221,Ross," No, it’s not just ‘cause I’m jealous. (Both Monica and
Chandler give him a ‘Come on’ look) I mean I’m not, I’m not, I’m
not jealous, okay? It’s… Look, the guy, he screamed, he actually screamed at
this couple sitting in our seats."
222,Chandler," Yeah, and at the end of the play, he, he got up y'know, and he just
started like, (claps his hands) banging his hands together!"
223,Ross," Okay, fine, fine. You don’t want to believe me? No, that’s fine.
(starts to leave)"
224,Monica, We’re kidding!
225,Chandler," Ross, don’t. Ross!"
228,Ross," You don’t want to believe me, I’m Mr. Funny to you. Mr.
Funny… (turns around and almost spills his coffee on Tommy) "
230,Ross," Whoa, sorry Tommy."
232,Ross, Umm…
234,Ross," Okay, it’s coffee."
236,Ross, It’s-it’s hot…
239,Rachel, (not seeing Ross) What’s your favourite thing about summertime?
240,Monica," Umm, going to the beach. When it stays light real late."
241,Rachel, Yeah…
243,Rachel," Tommyyyy! Say, what’s your favourite thing about summer?"
245,Chandler," Ohh, that’s a good one."
248,Joey," Sorry! Sorry, I’m late; sorry, I’m late! My duck and my chick
and a fight, it-it was ugly."
252,Joey, (surprised it’s Lauren) (hugs her) (whispering) Where’s Kate?
254,Joey, (stunned) What?!
256,Joey," Oh, ahh, go to the window. I’m wanna run down to the truck and show
you something."
258,Joey," (grabs the window from the outside and sticks his head in) (whispering)
When is she leaving?"
260,Joey, (making like he is yelling up to the second floor) I’m coming up!
263,Phoebe," Oh, I… (starts jabbering incoherently)"
264,Chandler," Why don’t you use ours across the hall, ‘cause
she…has…problems."
265,Ross," (coming out of the kitchen with a cup of coffee, almost running into
Tommy) Oh-ho, whoa! Sorry, Tommy. I almost spilled this hot coffee on you."
267,Ross," No, but it’s-it’s-it’s hot!"
269,Rachel," Ross, would you just stop it! It’s getting really old."
270,Ross, I can’t believe no one believes me!
271,Phoebe," I do, I believe you."
272,Ross, You do Pheebs?
273,Phoebe," Yeah. But I also believed her (points to the phone) when she said I was
next."
277,Chandler, Step away from the duck.
282,Joey, Hey!
284,Joey, Wh-wh-what’s going on? Wh-what’s this about L.A.?
286,Joey," But, but wh-what about us?"
288,Joey," Well, so, stay for the museums! "
291,Joey," Well can you at least stay to the end of the play? I mean, I’ll go to
the airport with ya, I-I wanna say good bye."
295,Joey, (to Lauren) In a minute!!
298,Joey," Yeah, I guess it is. (sees Kate is watching, he turns Lauren so that he
can talk directly to Kate, but still look like he is talking to Lauren) Listen, I ah, I
gotta say good bye, and-and I gotta say it quick ‘cause this is killing me. One thing
you gotta know, is that I will never forget you. But, you’ve got things you have to
do now, and so do I. And so… I’m gonna get on this spaceship, (smoke starts
pouring in from the ceiling, and a ladder comes down, with flashing, colored lights on the
side of it) and I’m gonna go to Blargon 7 in search of alternative fuels. But when I
return, 200 years from now, you’ll be long gone. But I won’t have aged at all.
(gets on the ladder) So you tell your great-great-granddaughter to look me up, because
Adrienne, baby, I’m gonna want to meet her. "
303,Monica," Phoebe, it’s been two days."
304,Phoebe," Yeah, I know. Oh, good thing it’s one of those 801 numbers. Right?"
305,Ross," Phoebe, 800 is toll free, 801 is-is Utah."
306,Phoebe," No, no, no, oh no-no-no, it’s has to be 800. (picks up the
instruction manual to check the phone number) ‘Cause all those big companies have 800
numbers, every one. (Finds the number) Yeah, every big Utah-based company has one."
307,Rachel, Phoe-be!!
308,Phoebe," Sorry, I’m so sorry, I will pay you back."
309,Chandler," And yet, she’s still not hanging up the phone."
311,Phoebe," Fine! Fine! (slams the phone down, breaking it) Oh-oh!"
312,Monica, What?
313,Phoebe," Well, I think I broke it. But that’s all right, here’s the
number you can call."
314,Monica, (sarcastic) Oh.
0,Joey," Hey, wouldn't be cool if our duck and chick had a little baby? We could
call it Chuck."
1,Chandler, Or... Dick.
2,Ross, (entering) Hey.
4,Ross," Listen, I-I need a favor. Umm, I was in the shower, and as I was cleansing
myself, I ah, I-I, well I felt something."
5,Chandler, Was it like a sneeze only better?
6,Ross," No, no, I mean, I mean a thing on my body."
7,Joey, (with a disgusted look) What was it?
8,Ross," Well, I don't know, it's-it's kinda in a place that's not... It's not
visually accessible to me, and I was hoping maybe you guys could-could help me out.
(starts to take off his pants)"
10,Chandler, No!!
11,Ross," Come on you guys, it's no big deal! (He turns around and shows him his
thing.)"
12,Chandler, Whoa-heeeiiiiii-iiiii-ah!! (sees it) Huh.
13,Ross," Well what is it? Is it a mole? (He moves closer to them, and they jump
back.)"
14,Joey," No, it's too wrinkly to be a mole."
15,Ross," Well, eww. What? Is it a pimple?"
16,Chandler," No, it's... fancier than a pimple. Look Ross, why don't you just go
see a… "
17,Rachel," (entering, interrupting them) Hey guys! What's... (sees what they're
doing and stops, the guys are stunned)"
18,Chandler," Okay, well, it's definite, two more weeks of winter."
19,Ross, Ahhh.
20,Joey," Yeah, right."
24,Phoebe," (to her date) Okay, and then this is the coffee house. This is where I
play my music. (points to the stage)"
26,Phoebe," Yeah, and these are my friends. People. This is Vince, Vince the people."
27,Rachel, Hi!
28,Chandler, Hey!
30,Phoebe, Vince is a fireman.
31,Rachel, Wow! Have you ever rescued anyone from a burning building before?
33,Chandler," Well, y'know if Joey and I played with matches we could get you up to
an even hundred. "
35,Chandler," You're right, I know."
37,Phoebe, Okay. (watches him leave)
38,Rachel," Wow, he's cute, Pheebs! But I thought you just started dating that
Kindergarten teacher."
39,Phoebe," Oh, Jason? Yeah, uh-huh, we're seeing each other tonight."
40,Rachel, What-Pheebs?! Two dates in one day? That's so unlike you.
41,Phoebe," I know, I know! I'm like playing the field. Y'know? Like, juggling two
guys, I'm sowing my wild oats. Y'know? Y'know, this kind've like y'know oat-sowin',
field-playin' juggler."
42,Joey," So Pheebs, do they know about each other?"
43,Phoebe," Does a dog's lips move when he reads? (Joey makes an `I don't know'
face, and looks to Chandler and Rachel, who're also stumped) Okay, no they don't."
44,Ross, (entering) Hey guys!
45,Joey, Hey.
46,Rachel, Hi!
48,Joey, (going over to him) Well?!
49,Chandler," (joining them) Okay, how'd it go at the doctor's?"
50,Ross," Well, he said there's definitely nothing to worry about, it's totally
benign."
51,Joey, Well what is it?!
52,Ross," He couldn't even tell me! He said it was just some sort of skin...
abnormality. And the worst thing is he-he-he said, he said, without being able to identify
it, he was reluctant to remove it."
53,Chandler," Y'know what? You should go to my guy, because when I went in there
with my third nipple. He just lopped it right off. Y'know? So I guess I'm lucky. I mean
not as lucky as people who were born with two nipples."
54,Ross," At least they knew what yours was. Y'know, yours had a name."
55,Joey," Oh! Maybe they'll name yours after you! Y'know, they'll call it, The Ross.
And then people would be like, ""Awww, he's got a Ross."""
56,Ross," (sarcastic) Yeah, that'd be cool!"
58,Monica, Pete's breaking up with me.
60,Monica," I just checked my messages, and he said that when he gets back from
Atlanta, we need to talk."
61,Rachel, And?
62,Monica," Well that's it. People never say `We need to talk' unless it's something
bad."
63,Joey," Whoa, that doesn't necessarily mean that he's breaking up with you."
64,Monica, Really?!
65,Joey," Yeah, maybe he just cheated on you."
68,Phoebe," That is so great! Oh, I... (sees that a parked car near them has caught
on fire) Oh my God!"
70,Phoebe, (the fire has worsened) Oh my God!!!
72,Phoebe, (stopping him) No! No! 
74,Phoebe," Well, we don't n-n-n-n-need a fireman, we'd, we'd like a good mechanic.
(hears the sound of approaching sirens) Oh my God, here they come! Well, we gotta get out
of here!"
76,Phoebe," Well look, if I wanted to see a fireman, I would date one. Okay? (she
drags him away)"
78,Ross," Th-th-that's all it is, a third nipple. Y'know? Just your run-of-the-mill
third nipple. Y'know? You can take it off. Just slice that baby right off!"
80,Ross, Just showing you my run-of-the-mill-slice-it-right-off third nipple.
82,Ross, No?
84,Ross," Well then, what is it?!"
89,Monica," (starting to get up) I gotta go water Pete's plants. (stops) Y'know
what, if he's gonna break up with me, maybe I won't water his plants."
90,Chandler," Well, if he's gonna break up with you, maybe Joey and I should water
his plants. If y'know what I mean."
91,Joey," Or ha-ha, we could go over there and pee on them."
92,Phoebe," (entering with Rachel) …and I-I can't take it! Y'know? I'm just,
always afraid one of them is gonna catch me with the other one. It's making me crazy."
93,Rachel," Well honey, then why don't you break up with one of them?"
94,Phoebe, (disgusted) Uh.
95,Joey," Whoa-whoa-whoa. What ah, what happened to playing the field?"
96,Phoebe," Well, it just, it doesn't feel like playing anymore, it feels like work.
It's like I'm working in the field."
97,Rachel," So Pheebs, pick one of them."
98,Monica, Yeah. Which one do you like more?
99,Phoebe," Well, Vince is great, y'know `cause, he's like a guy, guy. Y'know? He's
so burly, he's sooo very burly. (giggles)"
100,Joey," Okay, good, so there you go. Go with Vince."
101,Phoebe," Yeah, but Jason's really sensitive."
102,Chandler," Well sensitive is important, pick him."
103,Phoebe, Yeah.
104,Joey," Oh sure, go with the sissy."
105,Phoebe, Jason is not a sissy!
106,Joey," Oh no-no-no-no, I meant Chandler."
108,Ross, Y'know I have dinner plans!!
113,Monica," Okay, this is the den. All right, check this out. Lights! (the lights
turn on automatically, but are very bright) Whoa! All right. Less lights! Bad lights!
Lights go away! (they dim) Oh, see you just need to find the right command."
114,Ross," Yes, and the dimmer switch."
115,Joey," Whoa! For a rich guy he's got, that's a pretty small TV."
116,Monica," No-no-no, that's a video-phone. But hey guys you're not supposed to be
here, so please, do not touch anything."
117,Chandler, (sitting down on the couch) I-kea! This is comfortable.
118,Rachel, (entering with Phoebe) This place is amazing.
119,Phoebe," God, that is the nicest kitchen."
120,Monica, I know.
121,Phoebe," No! But it's the nicest kitchen, the refrigerator told me to have a
great day."
122,Joey, Look at this! A millionaire's checkbook.
123,Monica," Joey, put that down! (the phone rings) Oh my God! It's Pete. Okay, get
out!! How the hell do you answer a video-phone! (steps in front of it, and automatically
answers it)"
125,Monica, I guess that's how.
127,Monica," Oh it’s umm, good! It's umm, it’s good, just here watering the
plants."
129,Rachel, (standing up) Ahh... Chandler's on the couch!!
132,Joey," Hi, how ya doing?"
133,Monica," Ahh, Pete, the other day when you said you needed to talk, umm, just so
I know, is it good news or bad news."
135,Monica," Oh no-no-no, it's still me."
137,Monica," Oh, oh, okay umm, so I'll see you soon."
139,Monica, I love you.
141,Monica," Okay. Well, it's good news. It's good news."
142,Chandler," So, what do you thing the good news is?"
143,Joey," (looking at the checkbook) Wow! Look at this! He wrote a check for 50,000
dollars to Hugo Ligrens Ring Design. (Monica is stunned) Oh, sorry, what do you think the
good news is?"
145,Monica, Oh my.
146,Rachel, Monica's gonna marry a millionaire!!!
147,Ross," Hey, you gotta get Mom on the phone. Call Mom! Call Mom!"
150,Monica, And that's Pete's Mom. 
154,Rachel," Mon you definitely have to make it a theme wedding, and the theme could
be, “Look how much money we’ve got!” Y'know, I mean you could put, you
could put money in-in the invitations! You-you could have like little money place
settings. And ah, you could start with a money salad! I mean it’ll be dry, but people
will like it."
155,Monica," Would you stop? We’ve only been going out a couple of weeks, I mean
we don’t even know if he’s gonna propose."
156,Chandler," Yes, but this is Pete. Okay? He’s not like other people, on your
first date he took you to Rome. For most guys that’s like a third or fourth date
kinda thing."
157,Monica," Well if-if that’s what it is, then it’s-it’s crazy."
158,Ross," Monica’s right. We’re talking about getting married here. Okay?
She-she can’t just rush into this."
159,Rachel," Oh please, what do you know! You married a lesbian!"
161,Phoebe, All right. I gotta go. I have break up with Vince.
162,Chandler," Oh, so you’re going with the teacher, huh?"
163,Phoebe," Yeah, I like Vince a lot, y'know? But, it’s just Jason’s so
sensitive, y'know? And in the long run, I think sensitive it’s just better than
having just like a really, really, really nice (pause) butt. (Her eyes glaze over thinking
about the butt.) (pause) Jason! Definitely Jason! Okay, wish me luck!"
166,Rachel," OH MY GOD!!! (She holds her hands up in triumph and the gang all look at
her.) Sorry, I was just imagining what it’d be like to catch the money bouquet. "
168,Phoebe," Excuse me. Umm, is Vince here?"
171,Phoebe, Wow! I didn’t know you guys actually used those. 
173,Phoebe," Umm, wow. This-this isn’t gonna be easy. Umm, I don’t think we
should see each other anymore."
175,Phoebe, I’m sorry.
177,Phoebe," Oh my God, I didn’t…"
179,Phoebe, (running after him) Wait-wait-wait! Wait!!
181,Phoebe," (to Ross) I’m telling you, if you want to take care of that thing,
you should go to my herbal guy."
182,Ross," Thank you, but I want to remove it Pheebs. I don’t want to make it
savory."
183,Monica," Y'know when girls sleep with guys with weird things on their body, they
tell their friends about it."
184,Ross, Gimme this. (Grabs the herbalist’s card and leaves.)
185,Rachel," (entering) Hi! Okay, don’t be mad at me, but I couldn’t
resist."
186,Monica, Brides magazines?
187,Rachel," Yes, and I know that you’d say no if he asked you, but I’m
sorry; how great would you look walking down the aisle in this Donna Carin. (shows her the
picture.)"
188,Phoebe," (gasps) Oh, you so would! Oh, you should get that anyway. (They both
look at her.) Like for clubbing. "
189,Monica," It is so weird, I know what I said, but uh, this morning, I was lying in
bed I was, I was imagining what it would be like to say yes. (Rachel slams the magazine
shut in amazement.) I know it’s a little sudden, and it’s a little rushed, and
it’s totally not like me to do something like this, but that doesn’t mean I
can’t. Right? I mean I’m-I’m crazy about Pete, and I know that we want the
same things, and when I thought about saying yes, it made me really happy."
190,Rachel, Oh my God. (starting to cry) 
191,Monica, I know. (pause) I need more pie. (goes and gets some)
192,Phoebe," Hey Mon umm, if you do get married, can I bring two guests?"
193,Rachel, You didn’t break up with that fireman?
194,Phoebe," No, that was my way of telling you. Well, it turns out he’s
incredibly sensitive, he keeps a journal and he paints. He even showed me charcoal
drawings that he drew of me."
195,Rachel, Wow!
196,Phoebe," Yeah, well he’d prefer water colors, but y'know, he has easy access
to a lot of charcoal."
197,Monica," So then, are you going to dump Jason?"
198,Phoebe," Well, yeah, because I have to break up with someone, and… Okay so
Jason is sensitive, (holds up one finger) but now so’s Vince (holds up one finger on
her other hand) Plus, Vince has the body y'know? (holds up two more fingers on the Vince
side) So… It’s really just about the math."
200,Phoebe, (knocks on the door) Jason?
204,Phoebe, Nah-ha!
207,Ross, Hi.
209,Ross," Listen, I got to tell you I’ve-I’ve never been to a guru before,
so..."
211,Ross, What’s a koondis?
213,Ross, I guess it’s worth a try.
215,Ross, What?! What?!
217,Ross, We?! We angered it?!
219,Ross, Oh God!
221,Ross, Ow!! 
223,Ross," What was, what was that?"
225,Ross, What?! How’s that?
227,Ross, Hey! (congratulates him)
230,Monica," Ooh, nice."
232,Monica," Oh, right! I completely forgot about that."
234,Monica, Yeah?
236,Monica, Wow.
238,Monica, What’s that?
240,Monica, Okay. (not sure of herself)
242,Monica, You wanna what?!
244,Monica, What are you talking about?
246,Monica, And I suppose you used a ring designer for that.
248,Monica, My parents will be so happy.
250,Phoebe," (singing) “Crazy underwear, creepin’ up my butt. (Jason
enters) Crazy underwear, always in a rut. Crazy under-(sees Jason)-wear…” (In
her head) Oh No! What is he doing here? All right, just keep playing, just keep
playing. You’ll get through this; you’ll be fine. (She tries to continue the
song, but she has lost the ability to pronounce words, and the lyrics come out as
gibberish.) (giving up on the song) Okay, thank you. And, as always no one talk to me
after the show."
253,Phoebe, Hey!
256,Phoebe," I don’t know, he just started kissing me. Get him! Get him, Vince!"
259,Phoebe," Yeah, okay, I’ve-I’ve been dating both of you, and it’s
been really horrible. ‘Cause y'know it’s been a lot of fun, for me. Umm, but I-I
like you both, and I, and I didn’t know how to chose, so... I’m sorry, I’m
just, I’m terrible, I’m a terrible person. I’m terrible."
262,Phoebe, Really?!
266,Phoebe," Well, this is none of my business. (starts to walk away)"
268,Phoebe," Well, I made you a candle light dinner in the park."
270,Phoebe," (to Vince) Well, that could’ve been really awkward."
272,Phoebe," Yeah, but I-I-I-I can do that for you, I’m gonna do that for you."
276,Chandler," (comforting the duck) Everything’s gonna be all right. Okay,
Dick?"
278,Joey," Yeah, yeah. He’s got a, he’s got a really bad cough, and our
vet, he can’t do anything about it. Is there something you can do?"
0,Chandler," Do you think that there’s a town in Missouri or some place called
Sample? And ah, as you’re driving into town there’s-there’s like a sign,
and it says “You’re in Sample.” (He says it like urine sample.)"
1,Monica, (entering) Hey.
3,Rachel, How’d it go with Pete?!
4,Joey, Tell us!
5,Monica," You’re not gonna believe this. Okay, so I go over..."
13,Monica," So guys, listen, I go over there, and umm..."
26,Phoebe," All right, so, so you went to Pete’s..."
27,Ross, What happened?
28,Monica, (Robin is speaking loudly again) I...
32,Monica, Forget it. (they all turn and listen to Billy and Robin)
38,Joey, (to Billy) So you’re the gynaecologist?
43,Phoebe," So Monica, what were you gonna tell us?"
44,Monica, (pause) I have no idea.
47,Rachel," So, come on, what was the big news Pete wanted to tell you Mon?! Or
should I say Mrs. Monica Becker?"
48,Phoebe," No-no-no oh, keep your name, don’t take his name."
49,Monica, He didn’t ask me to marry him.
51,Phoebe, Well then definately don’t take his name.
52,Monica," He wanted to tell me he’s gonna compete is some ultimate fighting
competition thingy."
54,Rachel, Why?! What is it?
55,Monica, I don’t know exactly. It’s-it’s sorta like wrestling.
56,Phoebe, (intrigued) Oh?!
57,Monica," Yeah, but without the costumes."
58,Phoebe, (disappointed) Oh.
59,Joey," And it’s not fake, it’s totally brutal."
60,Chandler," Yeah, it’s two guys in a ring, and the rules are
“They’re are no rules.”"
61,Monica," So you can like, bite, and pull people’s hair and stuff?"
62,Ross," Yeah, anything goes, except ah, eye gouging and fish hooking."
63,Monica, What’s fish hooking?
64,Ross," Huh, what’s fish hooking... (Joey sticks his finger in Ross’s
mouth and pulls on his cheek, y'know like when you hook a fish.) (to Joey, sarcastic)
Thanks man, that would have been really hard to describe. What is that taste?"
65,Joey," What? My hands are totally clean, I just gave the duck a bath."
68,Chandler," Yes, but there’s two in martini, soo everybody back to my
office."
70,Chandler," Oh it’s Bing, sir. I’m sorry , I was just ah..."
73,Ross," (on phone) That’s right, Ryder. Wynona Ryder for six. (listens) Thank
you. (hangs up) (to the gang) Yeah, we have the reservations."
74,Rachel, Yes!!
75,Chandler," All right buddy, way to go! (smacks him on the butt)"
76,Ross," (stunned) Dude, what are you doing?"
77,Chandler," Thank you! Today, my boss keep slapping my butt and he was acting like
it was no big deal."
78,Phoebe," Yeesh, what’d you do about it?"
79,Chandler," Well, I didn’t do anything. I didn’t want to be the guy who
has a problem with his boss slapping his bottom."
80,Monica," I gotta tell ya, I think it’s okay to be that guy."
81,Joey," Yeah, maybe it’s like y'know, that jock thing. Y'know how football
players pat each other after touchdowns. (pats Ross on the butt) "
83,Rachel," Y'know I don’t, I don’t understand guys, I mean I-I would
never congratulate Monica on a great stew by y'know, grabbin’ her boob."
84,Chandler," Yeah, I know, for a really great stew you just y'know, stick your head
in between ‘em."
85,Monica," Okay, can we please go eat?"
86,Joey, Yeah. What are we getting?
87,Monica, (to Chandler) Anything but stew.
88,Ross," All right so, Chandler, from now on, don’t give your boss a chance to
get you. Y'know just ah, don’t turn your back to him."
89,Joey," Yeah, or you can teach him a lesson. Y'know? What you could do is you
could rub something that really smells on your butt, all right? Then, when he goes to
smack ya, his hand will smell. (thinking aloud) Now what could you rub on your butt that
would smell bad?"
90,Chandler, (to Ross and Monica) What if Joey were president?
92,Phoebe," Umm, hey Rach, can I ask you something?"
93,Rachel, Yeah.
94,Phoebe," Okay, you can totally say no, but umm, would it be okay with you if I
set Ross up on a date?"
95,Rachel," Oh, ah with who?"
96,Phoebe," Umm, my friend, Bonnie. She just always thought Ross was really cute,
and now that you two aren’t together, she asked if I could set it up, but if
you’re not cool with it..."
97,Rachel," Oh-oh-oh, which one is Bonnie again?"
98,Phoebe," You remember her from my birthday party two years ago. She’s yeah,
like, average height, medium build, bald..."
99,Rachel, Oh! (laughs) That’s fine.
100,Phoebe," Great! Okay, good for you! (as they leave she slaps Rachel on the butt)"
105,Monica, (entering) Hi!
108,Monica," Hey, umm, so listen umm, my friends were telling me a little about this
ah, ultimate fighting thing and it, well it sounds really dangerous. I-I don’t want
you to get hurt, ‘cause I kinda like you."
110,Monica, Promise me you’ll be careful.
112,Monica," Hey, are we still on for tonight?"
114,Monica," Okay, good, ‘cause umm, well maybe we could have a little workout
of our own..."
116,Monica, How ‘bout just a boom?
118,Rachel," (to Phoebe) Well that was depressing, I think I just bought a soft
pretzel from one of the kids from Fame. Ready to go to the movies?"
119,Phoebe, Um-hmm. Oh wait! This is Bonnie. (who has hair by the way)
121,Rachel," This is Bonnie? (to Phoebe) This is Bonnie? (to Bonnie) You’re
Bonnie?"
123,Rachel," Oh no, I’m sorry, you look a lot different from the last time I-I
saw you."
125,Rachel," Oh, that must be it."
126,Phoebe, (to Bonnie) Well I hope you have fun tonight.
130,Rachel, (to Phoebe) You said she was bald.
131,Phoebe," Yeah, she was bald, she’s not now."
132,Rachel, How could you not tell me that she has hair?
133,Phoebe," I don’t know, I hardly ever say that about people."
134,Rachel," (looks in the window) Ohh, well, this is just perfect!"
135,Phoebe," Well I’m sorry, I thought you said it was okay."
136,Rachel," Yeah, I said what was okay when I thought she was some weird bald chick.
I mean, y'know, that girl has hair got all over head!"
137,Phoebe," Well, maybe it won’t work out. Maybe Ross won’t like her
personality."
138,Rachel," Why, does she have a bad personality?"
139,Phoebe," Oh no, Bonnie’s the best!"
142,Chandler, (to his co-workers) What is with him?
145,Chandler," Well, that’s not true, he-he smacked you once."
149,Chandler, No sir.
152,Ross, (walking up with this huge tub-o-popcorn and drink) Hey!
153,Monica," God Ross, what is that?"
154,Ross," Yeah, it’s the Ultimate Fighting Combo. Yeah, I saved thirty cents,
plus I get to keep the cup. Yay!!"
157,Monica," I love you, Pete!!!"
160,Monica, (going up to the ring) Pete! Pete!! That guy’s pretty huge!
162,Ross," Well, then that guy is in serious, serious trouble."
164,Ross, All right! You go get him! Let’s go!
171,Monica," Hey! (she sits down next to him) It’s me. Mon-i-ca! Can I just tell
you how proud I am of you."
173,Monica," I mean I-I thought you were nuts at first, but you-you did it. And now
you can just look back at this thing with no regrets."
175,Monica," Well, you’re not gonna get going are you?"
177,Monica," Well, no. But..."
179,Monica, That guy stood on your neck until you passed out!
181,Monica, You didn’t know that already?
183,Monica," Okay, just get a lot better. (pause) Fast."
185,Monica, Yeah. That-that was the problem.
187,Monica, (joining them) Hey.
188,Ross, Hey! How long until Pete’s fight?
189,Monica," Oh, about five minutes. Right now they’re interviewing his
opponent. Apparently he trains by going to Iran and pulling the arms off thieves."
190,Ross, Hot dog?
191,Monica," Four, please. (Ross looks at her) I’m really nervous. (Ross gives
her the four dogs) Thank you. (she grabs four buns, and heads back inside)"
192,Phoebe," So Ross, how umm, how did it go with Bonnie?"
193,Ross," What? Oh! I gotta tell you, I-I wasn’t expecting to like her at all,
I mean I actually wasn’t expecting to like anyone right now, but she’s really
terrific."
194,Phoebe," Ohh, that’s too bad!"
195,Ross," No, I-I’m saying I liked her."
196,Phoebe," Yeah, y'know what, there are other fish in the sea."
197,Ross," Pheebs, I think she’s great. Okay? We’re going out again."
198,Phoebe," Okay, I hear you! Are you capable of talking about any thing else?"
199,Chandler, (joining them) Hey! Which one’s my turkey burger?
200,Ross," Ahh, the one next to my foot. Sorry."
201,Joey," (sticking his head out the window) Hey, the fight’s starting!"
202,Ross," Okay, we’ll be right in. (to Chandler) So ah, did your boss try to
slap you again today?"
203,Chandler," Nine times! Okay, I had to put on lotion! But, it’s gonna be
okay, because as of tomorrow I’m conducting an experiment, and if all goes as
planned, my butt will be smack free."
204,Joey, (sticking his head out the window) Fight’s over!
207,Chandler," Excuse me, Doug? (no reaction) Hey there sports fan!!"
209,Chandler," No, I ah, I didn’t do them."
211,Chandler," No, no I just ah, didn’t do them. Instead, I ah, hung out with a
couple of friends and had a couple of beers so I certainly don’t deserve any praise,
verbal or otherwise."
213,Chandler, Doug!!
215,Chandler," I’m a little bit uncomfortable with the that way you express
yourself."
217,Chandler," No, no. It-it’s not about the swearing, it’s more about ah,
the way, that you ah, occasionally, concentrate, your enthusiasm on my buttock."
219,Chandler," Oh, and don’t get me wrong, I appreciate the sentiment. It’s
just that I, I have a rather, sensitive posterior, and ah, besides, it’s making all
the other guys jealous."
221,Chandler, Okay. (he starts to leave)
223,Chandler," Ahhhhh! (walks out, imitating shooting himself in the head)"
225,Phoebe," Okay. Would you rather live in the shirt pocket of a sweaty giant, or
inside his shower drain?"
226,Rachel," (seeing Ross and Bonnie inside Central Perk) Oh my God! Phoebe look,
it’s Ross and that girl."
228,Phoebe," No! No! Look at that! (drags her away from the window) It’s a line
of ants! They’re working as a team!"
229,Rachel, Phoebe! (goes back to the window)
230,Phoebe," (looking in the window) Right, oh yeah. Wow, oh, it looks like Ross is
breaking up with her. Uff, I hope he lets her down easy. Let’s go."
231,Rachel," Come on Phoebe, look at that! They are not breaking up, look at them.
Okay that’s, you know what that is? That is a, that is a second date, that’s
what that is! Look at that, she just put her hand on his thigh..."
232,Phoebe," Oh no! That really is nothing, she is very sexually aggressive."
233,Rachel," Ohh! (walking away from the window) Phoebe, this is all your fault! Now
he loves her, he’s gonna marry her, and this is all your fault."
234,Phoebe, You said it was okay!
235,Rachel, You said she was bald!!
236,Phoebe, What?! What-what-what-what-what?!!
237,Rachel," Phoebe, we can’t, we just can’t just let it happen! Okay, we
have to do something! We have to break them up! Okay? Just go in there and like, shave her
head! You owe me one bald girl!!"
238,Phoebe," Okay, first of all, breathe. Second of all, I don’t get it.
Aren’t you the one that decided that you didn’t want to be with Ross?"
239,Rachel, (quietly) Yes.
240,Phoebe, Well isn’t he your friend? Don’t you want him to be happy?
241,Rachel, Yes.
242,Phoebe, So?
243,Rachel," I just y'know, I didn’t expect him to be this happy so soon. Ufff.
Ooo-ooh! (sits down on the curb) "
244,Phoebe, (sits down next to her and hugs her) Oh no.
245,Rachel, What?
246,Phoebe," Oh, we killed them all."
247,Rachel, Oh! 
251,Monica, Please tell me you’re stopping now.
253,Monica, You are insane! You-you gotta give this up!
255,Monica," Sit down. All right? Please, just listen to me. You are terrible at
this! Okay? You are the worst ultimate fighter ever! Ever!! "
257,Monica," Well then, y'know what? I care about you to much to watch you hurt
yourself like this. So if you have to do this, then you’re gonna have to do it
without me."
259,Monica, Then I’ve gotta go. Bye. (kisses him and starts to walk out)
261,Monica, Yes?
265,Chandler," Thank you, sir."
268,Chandler," No. No, not at all, that’s-that’s ridiculous."
270,Chandler," Ye-ye-yeah, yes I do!"
275,Chandler," Run! Run you crazy, rich freak!"
276,Rachel," Oh, I can’t watch this. (turns her eyes away)"
277,Joey," Check it out, he’s winning! (to Monica) Pete’s winning!"
278,Monica, Really?!
279,Joey, No-o-o!!
282,Phoebe," Wait, if that’s his favourite area, why is he being so mean to it?"
283,Ross," Well, this is ironic. Of your last two boyfriends, Richard didn’t
want to have kids, and from the looks of it, now Pete can’t."
0,Chandler," (to Bonnie) So ah, your first sexual experience was with a woman?!"
2,Chandler," Tell it again. (pause, we see Rachel is not amused.) Seriously."
4,Rachel," (to Monica) I mean is that woman capable of talking about anything else
but sex?"
5,Joey," Yeah, sure. Well y'know, earlier she was talking about geography."
6,Monica," Joey, she was listing the countries she’s done it in."
7,Joey," Well, I think we all learned something."
8,Phoebe," (entering, hurridly) Hey, you guys! Look what I found! Look at this!
(She hands Chandler a picture) That’s my Mom’s writing! Look."
9,Chandler," (reading the back of the picture) Me and Frank and Phoebe, Graduation
1965."
10,Phoebe, Y'know what that means?
11,Joey, That you’re actually 50?
12,Phoebe," No-no, that’s not, that’s not me Phoebe, that’s
her pal Phoebe. According to her high school yearbook, they were like B.F.F. (Ross and
Bonnie look at her quizzically) Best Friends Forever."
14,Rachel, That is so cool.
15,Phoebe," I know! So this woman probably could like have all kinds of stories
about my parents, and she might even know like where my Dad is. So I looked her up, and
she lives out by the beach. So maybe this weekend we could go to the beach?"
18,Ross, That’s too bad.
19,Rachel," (sarcastic) Ohh, big, fat bummerrr."
20,Phoebe, So great! Okay! Tomorrow we’re gonna drive out to Montauk.
21,Joey," Hey, Bonnie had sex there!"
25,Monica," (watching a happy couple walk by, arm in arm) Would you look at them. Am
I ever gonna find a boyfriend again? I gonna die an old maid."
26,Chandler," You’re not gonna die an old maid, maybe an old spinster cook."
27,Monica, (sarcastic) Thanks!
28,Chandler," Hey now besides, if worst comes to worst, I’ll be your boyfriend."
30,Monica, Yeah right.
31,Chandler, Why is that so funny?
32,Monica, You made a joke right? So I laughed.
33,Chandler," Ha-ha-ha. A little to hard. What am I not ah, boyfriend material?"
34,Monica," Well, no. You’re Chandler. Y'know, Chandler! (hits him on the arm)"
35,Chandler," Okay, so we’ve established my name, and hit me. But theoretically
y'know, I mean say we weren’t friends, say it’s a blind date. I show up at your
door, and I’m like (in a fake voice) “Hey, nice to meet, ya. Hey, oh-hey.”"
36,Monica, Well I’d probably be scared of a guy using a fake voice.
37,Joey, (walking up carrying a brown paper bag) Hey!
38,Monica," Oh, hey! Oh good, you brought food!"
39,Joey," No, it’s just my luggage."
42,Joey, Woo-hoo! All right! Yeah!
43,Phoebe," Oh, I am having the best karma this week. First, I find this woman who
knew my parents, and then my client with the fuzzy back gives me his beach house."
44,Ross," Yeah? What about ah, that bike messenger you hit?"
45,Phoebe," Oh, I wasn’t talking about his karma."
46,Rachel, (approaching) Hey! 
47,Chandler, Hey!
48,Joey," Hey-hey, check out the hat!"
50,Chandler," What a minute, I know that hat! I was taken aboard that hat! They did
experiments on me! I can’t have children!!"
51,Monica," Seriously, where did you get the hat?"
52,Rachel, Ross gave it to me.
53,Ross," Yeah, I think she looks good."
54,Rachel," Ohh, thank you."
55,Chandler," Buy it for ya, or win it for ya?"
56,Rachel," Well excuse me, my fashion-impaired friends, I am here to tell you that
hats are back."
57,Phoebe," And this time, they’ve ganged up to form one giant, super hat."
59,Ross," Go, go, go!"
60,Rachel," Oh yeah, now everybody wants to be under this hat!"
62,Phoebe, Oy!!
63,Monica," What’s with all this sand? (picking a handful of sand off of the
floor, which is covered in sand)"
64,Phoebe," Oh, yeah, Bob said there might be flood damage."
65,Ross," Yeah, either that, or he has a really big cat."
68,Phoebe," (at the door) Knock, knock, knock."
70,Phoebe," (entering) Are you ah, Phoebe Abott?"
72,Phoebe," Hi Phoebe Abott, I’m your best friends daughter!"
74,Phoebe," No, I-I mean your-your old best friend, here. (hands her the picture)
Lily, from high school. Remember?"
76,Phoebe," (points to herself) Phoebe. (points to her) Phoebe. Phoebe, yeah. She
named me after you I guess."
78,Phoebe," Yes!! Yes! Yes! Yes!! That’s my Dad, that’s Frank! Yeah!
I’m sorry I’m getting all flingy."
80,Phoebe," No-no, sorry. Cookies are good, thanks. "
82,Phoebe," (goes and gets some cookies) Well, so, umm, anyway umm, I’ve been,
I’ve been looking for my Father, and umm, have you heard from him, or seen him?"
84,Phoebe," (disappointed) Oh, okay. Well, so tell me everything about my parents.
Everything."
86,Phoebe," Oh, what? What was it?"
88,Phoebe," (happily) Yeah, no, it was great."
90,Joey," (getting an idea) Hey, y'know what a really good rainy day game is?"
91,Monica, What?!
92,Joey," I mean naked game. Strip poker, we should totally play strip poker."
94,Monica, What are you crazy?!
95,Joey," Come on! When you go away, you-you have to play, it’s like a law!"
96,Rachel, (to Monica) Allll done!
97,Monica," Aww, thank you."
98,Rachel," Okay, who’s next?! (She looks around the room, and stops when she
comes to Ross.)"
99,Ross, No-o-o! (Rachel gives him a “Please?” look.) No way! 
100,Rachel," Come on, please?! I’m boredddd! You let me do it once before."
102,Ross," Yeah well, if ah, if that’s the rule this weekend... (She gets up)
No!"
103,Rachel, Yes! (she starts creeping up on him)
104,Ross, Get away!
105,Rachel, Just once! 
106,Ross, Stay away!
107,Rachel," Take it like a man, Ross!"
108,Ross," (he gets up and starts to run away from her) No! (in his escape attempt he
crushes Chandler’s sand castle) No!"
109,Rachel," Oh, come on!"
110,Chandler, Big bullies!!
112,Ross," Ow! Ow! Oh, no-no-no!"
114,Phoebe," (entering) Oh, hey!"
115,Chandler, Hey!
116,Ross, Hey!
117,Phoebe," Oh, so, how are we doing?"
118,Chandler, Bored and bored!
119,Joey," Hey, you know what naked card game is never boring?"
121,Monica, (to Phoebe) So what’s Phoebe like?
122,Phoebe," I’m kind, caring, and sweet. What’s Monica like?"
123,Monica," Ah no, the other Phoebe, the one you went to go see."
124,Phoebe," Ohh, I think she knows where my Dad is."
125,Joey, What?
126,Rachel, Really?!
127,Monica," Oh well, where is he?!"
128,Phoebe," She was acting, she was pretending like she hasn’t heard from him
on years, but I found this picture on her fridge, and look (shows Monica)! Isn’t this
what he would look like now?"
129,Monica, (gasps) Totally familiar. (Phoebe shows the rest of them.)
130,Rachel," Oh, yeah."
132,Monica," Well, why would she lie to you?"
133,Phoebe," I don’t know, but we’re having dinner tomorrow night, so I
figured, she’s gonna tell me then. Y'know maybe she just wanted to give him time to,
buy me presents, I don’t know! So, you’re all bored?"
135,Chandler, Yes!
136,Phoebe," All right, I’m gonna close my eyes and point to someone, and you,
whoever I point has to come up with something fun for us to do, and we have to do
it. "
137,Joey," Okay, all right. "
138,Phoebe, Okay.
139,Joey, Fan out! Fan out!
141,Phoebe," Okay. (Starts to spin) Ooh, y'know we could just do this. (She stops at
Chandler)"
142,Chandler," Okay, umm, we all have to play strip poker."
143,Joey, (jumping in triumph) OH YES!!!!!
145,Monica, Strip Happy Days Game?
146,Joey," Yeah, well, I couldn’t find any cards, so it was either this or Strip
Bag Of Old Knitting Stuff."
148,Ross," Okay, (reading the card) Fonzy gives you two thumbs up, collect two cool
points. Yeah."
149,Phoebe," Monica, if you get five cool points, you get to make somebody take off
one item of clothing. It hasn’t happened yet, but we’re all very excited."
150,Ross," Okay, come on! (blows on the dice) Daddy needs a new pair of
electromagnetic microscopes for the Prehistoric Forensics Department! (They all look at
him, and he shuts up and rolls the dice.) (he moves his piece) Okay. (reading a card) Take
Pinky Tuscadero up to Inspiration Point, collect three cool points!! Yeah! Which gives me
five, and let’s see who is gonna lose their clothes. Ummmm, I think I pick our strip
poker sponsor Mr. Joey Tribianni."
152,Joey," All right, relax. It’s just a shoe."
155,Rachel," (reading a card) Okay, your band is playing at Arnold’s, collect
three cool points. Which means, I have five, and that means I get Joey’s boxers!"
156,Joey, Fine. Gang up on me! I got you all right where I want you.
157,Phoebe," Come on, take ‘em off!!"
158,Joey," Actually, y'know it’s kinda cold, so how about I keep my boxers on,
and give you all a peek at the good stuff?"
159,Rachel," (getting up) All right, I’m gonna make more margaritas! (She pours
the rest of the pitcher into Ross’s glass.)"
160,Ross," Whoa, hey! What are doing? Trying to get me drunk?"
161,Rachel, I’m just making margaritas.
162,Ross, Okay.
163,Monica," I think I’ll help her out. (She gets up to go over and help Rachel,
and reveals she has no pants.) (to Rachel) What is going on here?"
164,Rachel, What?! 
165,Monica, You painting his toenails?
166,Rachel," Oh, come on!"
167,Monica, Chasing him all around the room?
168,Rachel," Monica, please?"
169,Monica, He’s totally flirting with you too.
170,Rachel," (pause) He is, isn’t he? I don’t know, I don’t know, I
mean maybe it’s just being here at the beach together or, I don’t know. But
it’s like something... (she’s interrupted by the sound of Bonnie entering)"
172,Ross, Hey! (Rachel is shocked) Hi Bonnie!
174,Ross, Oh.
176,Joey, We’re playing Strip Happy Days Game!
180,Chandler," So, you still don’t think I’m boyfriend material?"
181,Monica, Huh?
182,Chandler, I saw you checking me out during the game last night.
183,Monica, You didn’t even take off your pants.
184,Chandler," Yeah, well, lucky for you."
185,Monica, What?
186,Chandler, I don’t know.
187,Rachel, (entering) Well! Is everybody else having just the best time?!
188,Phoebe, Shhh! Shhhh! Joey’s asleep.
190,Phoebe," After he passed out, we put the sand around him to keep him warm."
191,Rachel," Well I assume the ah, happy couple isn’t up yet. Did you guys hear
them last night?"
192,Chandler," Oh, yeah, I don’t know what they were doing, but at one point sea
turtles actually came up to the house."
194,Ross, Good morning.
197,Rachel," Oh, great."
198,Monica, Like a log.
200,Rachel, I’m going for a walk.
202,Ross, (to Joey) Good morning. Nice breasts by the way.
206,Rachel," Oh, ah nothin’. I just felt like hangin’ out here and reading."
208,Rachel," Ohhhh, sorry I missed that."
210,Rachel, Ohh-ha-ha!
212,Rachel," Y'know, I gotta tell ya, I just loved your look when you were
bald."
214,Rachel, Ohh!
216,Rachel, Really?!
218,Rachel, I mean you definitely should do that.
220,Rachel, Yeah!
222,Rachel," Awww, stop. Come on. Now go shave that head!"
226,Joey," What’s the matter, Pheebs?"
227,Phoebe, She cancelled! My namesake cancelled on me!
228,Joey, What?!
229,Phoebe," Yeah, she clamed she had to go out of town suddenly. She’s avoiding
me, she doesn’t want to tell me where my Father is. She knows, and she won’t
tell me."
230,Rachel," Aww Pheebs, that sucks!"
231,Phoebe," Yeah, well, don’t “Aww Pheebs, that sucks!” me yet. (she
starts to leave)"
232,Chandler, Where ya going?
233,Phoebe," Well, she’s out of town so, there’s gotta be something in her
house that tells me where my Father is."
234,Ross," Uh, Pheebs, some people call that breaking and entering."
235,Phoebe," Well, are any of those people here?!"
237,Phoebe," Okay, look I-I-I do something nice, okay? I’ll-I’ll fill her
ice trays."
241,Ross," Wh-haa-haa! Look what ‘cha did! (Rachel has her hand over her mouth
to keep from laughing.)"
243,Ross," Nooo, but it, but it’s great."
245,Ross, Okay. (He gently touches it.) You can feel all the bones in your skull.
247,Ross, Hi.
248,Rachel, Hi!
249,Ross," I was having a little chat with ah, Bonnie, and ah, guess what, she-she
happened to bring up y'know, who was behind the um, whole head shaving idea, and now, who
was it? Oh, that’s right, that’s right, it was you!"
250,Rachel," That was her idea, I just gave her a nudge."
251,Ross, She said you gave her the razor!
253,Rachel, Hey!
255,Ross," Ahh, no, I’m good."
257,Ross," Okay, have fun! Wooo!!"
258,Rachel," Come on see, she doesn’t look that bad."
259,Ross," You can see the moonlight bouncing off her head! What the hell were you
thinking?!!"
260,Rachel, I don’t know.
261,Ross," You don’t know?! Rach, you balded my girlfriend!"
262,Rachel," All right! Ross, do you think it’s easy for me to see you with
somebody else?"
263,Ross," Y'know, hey! You’re the one who ended it, remember?"
264,Rachel," Yeah, because I was mad at you, not because I stopped loving you!"
265,Ross, You still love me?
266,Rachel, Noo.
267,Ross, You still love me.
268,Rachel," Oh, y-yeah, so, you-you love me!"
269,Ross," Noo, nnnnn. What does this mean? What do you, I mean do you wanna, get
back together?"
270,Rachel," Noo! Maybe! I, I don’t know. Ross, I still can’t forgive you
for what you did, I can’t, I just, but sometimes when I’m with you I just, I
feel so..."
271,Ross, What?!
272,Rachel," I just, I feel, I-I just..."
273,Ross, What?
274,Rachel, I feel...
276,Chandler," (to Joey) Noo!! I don’t care! I’m not, I’m not gonna
playing one-on-one strip poker with you for practice! "
278,Joey, But I made cards!!
279,Rachel, Well! Good night. (to Ross) I’m going upstairs.
282,Joey, (to Ross) Wanna play strip poker for practice?
285,Phoebe," Ow! My ass. Okay. Okay. (She manages to climb completely inside and the
window slams shut.) Oh, shhh!"
287,Phoebe," No! No!! It’s me! It’s me! I-I didn’t want to make any
noise!"
289,Phoebe, I’m sorry.
291,Phoebe," I-I, came to fill your ice cube trays."
293,Phoebe," Umm, okay, okay, look. I took this picture from your fridge. Okay,
because I know that this is my Father. Yeah, this is Frank Buffay and you are standing
right there next to him. Now, look I deserve to know where I came from. All right? So if
you can help me find my Father then you should! Otherwise, you’re just mean! (pause)
So, just tell me the truth!"
295,Phoebe, My Father is Chuck Magioni?
297,Phoebe, Oh.
299,Phoebe, Heh?
303,Joey," I’m telling ya, you guys are totally getting back together!"
304,Ross," That’s not true! Her, she doesn’t even know what she wants!
Rachel’s still mad about the whole thing."
305,Chandler," Okay, then you gotta back away, all right? You don’t need that
kind’ve hurt. Take it from a guy who’s never had a long term relationship......"
306,Ross," I know, but ahhhhhh!! I really wanna go up there and finish that kiss!"
308,Chandler, Ahhhh! (Steps away from her.)
310,Chandler," Oh, ahh, no thanks, I just had an M&M."
312,Ross, Good night.
314,Ross, Okey-dokey!
315,Chandler, There is not one hair on that head.
316,Ross," Hey, it’ll grow back, right? And she-she’s really fun, and
she’s cool, and-and I’m finally moving on. Y'know? I mean getting over Rachel
was so (makes an incoherent nasal sound), y'know? Y'know, and I’m finally feeling
sane again. And now if I go up there, and-and I kiss her, and, Gooood I wanna kiss her,
and-and-and it doesn’t work out, right? Do I really wanna put myself through that
again?"
317,Joey," So let me get this straight. If you go with Bonnie tonight, you’re
doing the smart, healthy thing and moving on."
318,Ross, Yeah.
319,Joey," Right, and you go with Rachel, Bonnie’s free tonight?"
321,Ross, (entering the bedroom) Hi. (closes the door)
324,Chandler, (in a fake voice) Hi there.
325,Monica, That’s that weird voice again.
326,Chandler," Okay! Okay! Let me try it again, you’re gonna wanna date this
next guy, I swear!"
328,Chandler," Hi! I’m Dorf! You’re date for the evening. (Monica walks
away in disgust) Oh come on! Dorf on dating, that’s good stuff!!"
2,Phoebe, Ehh?
4,Joey," (voice-over) Oh, and then Monica joked that she wouldn’t go out with
a guy like Chandler..."
5,Chandler," (to Monica) (in a funny voice) Hi there. (Monica turns her head away
in disgust)"
6,Joey," (voice-over) ...and he couldn’t let it go, and... I don’t really
know what happened with that either. "
8,Joey," (voice-over) Oh-oh! And then Ross’s new girlfriend, Bonnie, shows up
and Rachel convinced her to save her head. And then Ross and Rachel kiss, and now Ross has
to choose between Rachel and the bald girl and I don’t know what happened there
either... "
10,Joey," Y'know what, hold on, let me go get Chandler. (gets up and leaves.)"
12,Ross, (surprised) Hi!
15,Ross, Awww.
17,Rachel," Oh, you’re welcome a million."
19,Ross," Yeah. (closes the door, and goes over and kisses Rachel.)"
20,Rachel, (softly) Oh my God.
21,Ross, I know.
23,Ross," (stopping suddenly and getting up) Okay, I gotta go."
24,Rachel, Whoa! What?! Why?!
25,Ross," Well, I-I gotta go break up with Bonnie."
26,Rachel, Here?! Now?!
27,Ross," Well, yeah. I can’t-I can’t stay here all night, and if I go in
there she’s-she’s gonna wanna... do stuff."
28,Rachel," Well, can’t you tell her that you are not in the mood?"
29,Ross," No, she likes that. Yeah. Faking sleep doesn’t work either, I
can’t tell you how many mornings I woke up with her..."
30,Rachel, (interrupting) Whoa-ho.
31,Ross," Whoa-oh, okay! Yeah, why am I telling you that?"
32,Rachel, I don’t know.
34,Ross," Yeah, yeah. (opens the door) It wasn’t every morning."
35,Rachel," Oh, making it worse!"
36,Ross, Okay.
40,Phoebe," I-I mean I, well I think I can figure it out. I guess y'know I was born,
and everyone started lying their asses off!"
42,Phoebe, How close?
44,Phoebe, I don’t even know how that would work!
46,Phoebe, (interrupting) I’m not asking!
48,Phoebe," Yeah. Let’s see, my had Mom killed herself, and my Dad had run off,
and I was living in a Gremlin with a guy named Cindy who talked to his hand."
50,Phoebe," Yeah, well, everybody does! I’m a really cool person. And y'know
you had 29 years to find that out, but you didn’t even try! Y'know what, you walked
out on me, and I’m just, I’m gonna do the same thing to you."
52,Phoebe, I don’t ever want to see you again! 
54,Phoebe," (walking back in with her hand over her eyes.) Umm, where’s my
purse?"
56,Monica, (closing the fridge in disgust) Shoot! We’re out of soda.
57,Chandler," (jumping up) Oh, I’ll go out and get you some."
58,Monica, Really?!
59,Chandler," Nope! Because I’m not your boyfriend. (to Phoebe, who’s
entering) Hey Pheebs, how did it go?"
60,Phoebe," Well, umm, my Mom’s friend, Phoebe, is actually my birth Mom."
62,Chandler, I found a dried up seashores.
63,Monica," Sweety, what are you talking about?"
64,Phoebe," Oh, my new Mom, who-who’s a big, fat abandoner! (starts to go
upstairs)"
65,Joey," Whoa, wait, Pheebs, wait a second! Don’t you wanna stay here and talk
about it?"
66,Phoebe," No. I’m just, I wanna, I need to be alone."
68,Phoebe," (turning around, insistently) Monica!"
69,Monica, Oh.
71,Ross, It’s over.
72,Rachel," Oh, was it awful?"
73,Ross," Well, it was loong. I didn’t even realise how late it was, until I
noticed the 5 o’clock shadow on her head. (They both start to laugh, then stop
themselves quickly.) Anyway, she didn’t want to stay. I called a cab; she just left."
75,Rachel, I wrote you a letter.
76,Ross," Ohh! Thank you! I like mail. (He goes to kiss her again, but she turns
away.)"
77,Rachel," (handing him the letter) It’s just some things I’ve been
thinking about. Some things about us, and before we can even think about the two of us
getting back together, I just need to know how you feel about this stuff."
78,Ross," Okay. (He leans in to kiss her again, but she leans back preventing him
from making contact.) Wow, it’s-it’s 530 in the morning. (Rachel laughs) So,
I’d better get cracking on this baby."
79,Rachel," Well, I’ll be waiting for you, just come up when you’re done."
80,Ross," Okay, I’ll be up in, (looks at the letter) 18 pages. Front and back.
Very exciting."
82,Ross," Oh. (looks at his watch) Oh-oh. (takes a drink of coffee and resumes
reading the letter)"
83,Rachel," (coming down the stairs) Hey! (Ross jumps up, and quickly puts the
letter back together, pretending like he has just finished it.) What happened to you? Why
didn’t you come up?"
84,Ross, Done!
85,Rachel, You just finished?
86,Ross," Well, I wanted to be thorough. I mean this-this is clearly very, very
important to you, to us! And so I wanted to read every word carefully, twice!"
87,Rachel," So umm, does it?"
88,Ross, I’m sorry.
89,Rachel, Does it?
90,Ross," Does it? Does it? Yeah, I wanted to give that whole ‘Does it?’
part just another glance."
91,Rachel," What are you talking about, Ross, you just said that you read it twice!
Look, y'know what, either it does or it doesn’t, and if you have to even think
about it..."
92,Ross," (interrupting) No, Rach, no. I don’t, I don’t, I don’t have
to think about it, in fact, I’ve decided, I’ve decided that, that it.......does."
94,Rachel, Are you sure?
95,Ross," Oh, sure! I’m sure."
96,Rachel," I know. (Hugs him more violently this time and pushes him back away from
the letter.)"
98,Chandler," All right, there’s a nuclear holocaust, I’m the last man on
Earth. Would you go out with me?"
99,Monica, Ennnh.
100,Chandler, I’ve got canned goods.
101,Joey," (jumping up in a hole that he is digging, he is shoulder deep) Hey, you
guys! Take a look at this! (Chandler and Monica jump up and go over to the hole.) Check
this baby out, dug me a hole!"
102,Chandler," Excellent hole, Joe."
104,Joey, Oh no! No!! My hole!!
105,Monica, (screaming in pain) Ow!! Ow!!!
106,Joey, (climbing out of the hole) What?! What?!! What is it?!
107,Monica," Jellyfish sting! Oh, it hurts! It hurts!! It hurts!!"
108,Chandler," Well, can we help?! You want us to take you back to the house?!"
109,Monica, It’s like two miles!
110,Joey," Yeah, and I’m a little tired from digging the hole."
111,Monica, Oh damn the jellyfish. Damn all the jellyfish!
112,Chandler, We’ve got to do something!
113,Joey," Well, there’s really only one thing you can do."
114,Monica, What?! What is it?!
115,Joey, You’re gonna have to pee on it.
116,Monica, What?!! Gross!!
117,Joey," Don’t blame me, I saw it on The Discovery Channel."
118,Chandler," Y'know what, he’s right. There’s something like uh, ammonia
in that, that like kills the pain."
119,Monica, Well forget it! It doesn’t hurt that (tries to take a step) baaad!!!!
120,Joey, If you want some privacy you can use my hole.
122,Phoebe," Well, I’m ready to get the hell out of here! (Sees Ross and Rachel
cuddling on the couch.) Oh. Are you? Are you?!! (they nod ‘Yes.’) Ohh!
That’s so great!! Ooh, not for Bonnie. (they nod ‘No.’) But for you, yay!
Ohh."
124,Ross, Hey!
125,Rachel, How was the beach?
126,Monica," Nothing, I don’t know."
127,Ross, What happened?
128,Monica, Nothing. I’m gonna take a shower.
129,Chandler, Me too!!
130,Joey, Me too.
131,Phoebe," Okay, I’m gonna put this (her suitcase) in the car."
132,Rachel," Ooh, I have to go pack. (Gets up to do so.) It really does?"
133,Ross, It does. It really and truly does.
135,Ross, (finding the part) (looks up in disgust) It so does not!!!
138,Ross," She wants me to take responsibility for everything that went wrong
in our relationship. I mean she goes on for five pages about, about how I was unfaithful
to her! (Both Joey and Chandler shrug their shoulders as to say ”Well...”)
(yelling) WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!!!"
139,Chandler," Oh my God! If you say that one more time, I’m gonna break
up with you!"
140,Ross," Fine! Fine! But this break-up was not all my fault, and she, she says
here, (reading from the letter) “If you accept full responsibility...” (to
Chandler and Joey) Full responsibility! “...I can begin to trust you again. Does that
seem like something you can do. (yells at Joey) Does it?!!”"
141,Joey, No?
142,Chandler," Look, Ross, you have what you want, you’re back with Rachel. If
you bring this up now you’re gonna wreck the best thing that even happened to you."
143,Ross," (calming down) Yeah, I know. I mean, no, you’re right. Yeah I guess
I’ll let it go. But you-you understand how-how hard it is to forget about this."
144,Joey," Sure, it’s hard to forget! But that doesn’t mean you have to
talk about it! A lot of things happened on that trip that we should never, (to Chandler)
ever talk about."
145,Ross, What the hell happened on that beach?!
146,Joey," It’s between us and the sea, Ross!"
149,Phoebe," (to the person that answered the door) Hi, Ursula."
151,Phoebe," Okay, well umm, I know that we haven’t talked in a long time, but
umm okay, our Mom is not our birth Mom. This-this other lady is our birth Mom."
153,Phoebe, (shocked) You know her?!
155,Phoebe," There-there was a suicide note?! (Ursula nods ‘Yes.’) Well, do
you still have it?"
157,Phoebe, I can’t believe you didn’t tell me there was a suicide note!
159,Phoebe," I, umm, shut up!"
161,Phoebe," (reading from the note) “Good-bye Phoebe and Ursula. I’ll miss
you. P.S. Your Mom lives in Montauk.” You just wrote this!"
163,Phoebe, Noooo!!
166,Monica," Pass the cheese, please."
168,Monica," My God, you can’t even look at me! Can you?"
169,Joey, Nope.
171,Chandler, (jumping up) Hey! Phoebe! We can talk to Phoebe!!
172,Phoebe, No. I’m-I’m to depressed to talk.
173,Chandler, I’ll give you a thousand dollars to talk to us.
174,Ross," (coming back in with Rachel) Hey, you guys! What do you, what do you think
about making that beach trip an annual thing?"
176,Rachel," All right, that’s it, you guys! What happened out there?"
177,Monica," What? We took a walk, nothing happened. I can back with nothing all over
me."
179,Ross, What happened? Joey?
180,Joey, All right. (gets up) 
181,Monica," (stopping him) No! Joey, we swore we’d never tell!"
182,Chandler, (running over and joining Monica) They’ll never understand!
183,Joey," Well, we have to say something! We have to get it out! It’s eating me
alive!! Monica got stung by a jellyfish."
184,Monica," (interrupting) All right!! All right. (walks slowly into the living
room) I got stung. Stung bad. I couldn’t stand. I-I couldn’t walk."
185,Chandler," (following Monica) We were two miles from the house. Scared and alone.
We didn’t think we could make it. (He goes to put his hands on Monica’s
shoulders but for some reason can quite complete the action and pulls back.)"
186,Monica, I was in too much pain.
187,Joey, And I was tired from digging the huge hole!
188,Chandler, And then Joey remembered something.
189,Joey, I’d seen this thing on The Discovery Channel...
190,Ross," Wait a minute! I saw that! On The Discovery Channel, yeah! About
jellyfish and how if you... (stops suddenly and turns to look at Monica) Ewwww!! You peed
on yourself?!"
192,Monica," You can’t say that!! You-you don’t know!! I mean I thought I
was gonna pass out from the pain! Anyway I-I tried, but I-I couldn’t...bend that way.
So... (looks at Joey.)"
194,Joey," That’s right I stepped up! She’s my friend and she needed help!
And if I had too, I’d pee on anyone of you! Only, uhh, I couldn’t. I got the
stage fright. I wanted to help, but there was too much pressure. So-so I uh, I turned to
Chandler."
195,Chandler," (wails loudly into his hands) Joey kept screaming at me, “Do it
now! Do it!! Do it! Do it now!!” Sometimes late at night I can still here the
screaming."
196,Joey," (laughs) That’s ‘cause sometimes I just do it through my wall to
freak you out."
198,Phoebe," (singing) “...fuchsia and mauvvve. Those are the 66 colours of my
bedroommmm.” (applause) Thank you, thank you. Ohh, and I invite you to count the
colours in your bedroom. (Sees that Phoebe Sr. has entered, and to her) Except for you.
You go away."
200,Phoebe," Okay, bye."
202,Phoebe, No.
204,Phoebe," But, it’s not like we’re losing anything. Y'know?"
206,Phoebe," It’s not like we-we know each other or anything. Or that have anything
in common."
208,Phoebe, I-I like pizza!
210,Phoebe," Oh my God, so do I!"
212,Phoebe," Wait-wait-wait, wait! Puppies. Cute or ugly?"
214,Phoebe," Uh-huh, well! But umm, still I’m-I’m mad at you."
216,Phoebe," Well umm, do you wanna get something to eat? I’m kinda hungry."
218,Phoebe," All right, stop it. Now you’re just doing it to freak me out."
220,Rachel," Oh-hooo, I missed you."
221,Ross, I missed you too.
222,Rachel," Ooh, I was soo nervous about that letter. But the way you owned up to
everything, it just showed me how much you’ve grown. Y'know?"
223,Ross, (getting miffed) I suppose.
224,Rachel," You have! Ross, you should give yourself credit. I mean my Mom never
thought this would work out. It was all, “Once a cheater, always a cheater.”"
225,Ross, (getting angry) Umm-hmm.
226,Rachel," Ooh, I just wish we hadn’t lost those four months, but if time was
what you needed just to gain a little perspective..."
228,Ross, (yelling from the bedroom) WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!!!!!
229,Chandler, (entering with Joey) (to Monica) Coffee house?
230,Monica, You bet.
232,Ross," And for the record, it took two people to break up this
relationship!!"
233,Rachel," Yeah! You and that girl from that copy place, which yesterday you took
full responsibility for!!"
234,Ross," I didn’t know what I was taking full responsibility for! Okay?! I
didn’t finish the whole letter!"
235,Rachel, What?!!
236,Ross, I fell asleep!
237,Rachel, You fell asleep?!
238,Ross," It was 530 in the morning, and you had rambled on for 18 pages. Front and
back!! (they go into the living room, trapping Monica, Chandler, and Joey in the kitchen)
(to Rachel) Oh-oh-oh, and by the way, Y-O-U-apostrophe-R-E means ‘you are,’
Y-O-U-R means ‘your!’"
239,Rachel," Y'know I can’t believe I even thought about getting back
together again! We are so over!!"
240,Ross," (starts to cry) FINE BY ME!! (he opens the door and traps Chandler behind
it)"
241,Rachel," Oh, oh, and hey-hey-hey, those little spelling tips will come in handy
when you’re at home on Saturday nights playing Scrabble with Monica!!"
242,Monica, Hey!!
243,Rachel," (to Monica) Sorry!! (to Ross) I just feel bad about all that sleep
you’re gonna miss wishing you were with me!"
244,Ross," Oh, no-no-no don’t you worry about me falling asleep. I still have
your letter!!!"
245,Rachel," And hey! Just so you know, it’s not that common! It doesn’t
happen to every guy! And it is a big deal!!"
246,Chandler, I KNEW IT!!!!
249,Monica, (sets down some cards) Gin.
250,Chandler," We were playing Gin? Y'know if we were a couple, we could play this
game naked."
251,Monica, Will you stop!
252,Chandler, Okay. All right.
253,Monica," Okay, all right, I think you’re great, I think you’re sweet,
and you’re smart, and I love you. But you will always be the guy who peed on me."
0,Chandler, Wow! That ripped! That ripped real nice!
1,Joey," How many times do I have to tell you! Ya, turn and sliiiide! Y'know, turn
and slide."
2,Chandler," You don’t turn and slide, you throw it out! I’m tired of
having to get a tetanus shot every time I get dressed!"
3,Joey," Look, we’re not throwing it out! I built this thing with my own
hands!"
4,Chandler," All right, how about we, how ‘bout we sell it."
5,Joey," All right. But, you’re gonna have to tell them. (He opens the cabinet
to reveal the chick and the duck living inside with Christmas lights and a disco ball as
decorations.)"
6,Chandler," (nods his head) Do you mind if we stick you in another cabinet? (to
Joey) They seem all right with it!"
10,Monica, Yesss!!
11,Ross, Who’s Chip?
12,Monica, Shhh!
14,Monica," Chip, is Chip Matthews."
15,Ross, The guy who took Rachel to the prom? Why is he calling you?
16,Monica," ‘Cause I ran into him at the bank, he is still soo cute."
17,Ross," Monica, you’re so lucky! He’s like the most popular guy in
school!!"
18,Monica," I know!! (calls him) (on phone) Chip? Hi! It’s Monica. (listens)
‘Kay. (listens) ‘Kay. (listens) Okay. (listens) Okay, good-bye. (hangs up) Oh my
God, we just had the best conversation!! (goes into her room as Rachel enters)"
19,Ross, (to Rachel) I was just leaving.
20,Rachel," Good! ‘Cause I’ve got a product report to read, it’s like
eight pages, I hope I don’t fall asleep."
21,Ross, Why? Did you write it?
22,Rachel," (sees Chip’s phone number) Wow! Look at that, Chip Matthews called.
I wonder what he wants?"
23,Ross," Well ah, actually..."
24,Rachel," (interrupting) I bet he sensed that I was ready to have sex with another
guy."
25,Ross," Well, umm, why don’t you give him a call?"
26,Rachel, Okay. (picks up phone) Are you sure you wanna hear this?
27,Ross," Oh, I’m sure."
28,Rachel," (on phone) Chip! Hi, it’s Rachel. (listens) Rachel Green. Yeah,
umm, you left me a message. (listens) Yes you did, my roommate wrote it down. (listens)
Monica Geller. (listens) Ohh."
29,Ross," (whispering in her ear) Oh, that’s right! He called to ask out
Monica! That-that’s gotta be embarrassing! "
31,Phoebe," (screaming, angrily) ...DUMB, DRUNKEN, BITCH!!! (applause) (happily)
Thank you, thanks."
32,Ross," (reading the newspaper) Hey, here’s a question; where did you guys
get the finest oak East of the Mississippi?"
33,Chandler," Uh-huh, first you tell us where you got the prettiest lace in all the
land."
34,Ross, I’m reading your ad.
35,Joey," Looks good, uh?"
36,Ross, Yeah.
37,Chandler," (reading the ad) Stunning entertainment center. Fine, (pause) fine
Italian craftsmanship. (Joey is very proud of himself)"
38,Phoebe," Oh my God, you guys are selling the entertainment center?"
39,Rachel, Why? I love that thing.
40,Chandler, You want it?
42,Chandler," Ahh, Gepeto, $5,000 dollars? Are you insane?"
43,Joey," Hey, the ad alone cost 300 bucks!"
44,Chandler," All right look, I’m changing it to 50 bucks, or your best offer."
45,Joey, What kind of profit is that?! And you call yourself an accountant.
46,Chandler, (looks at him) Nooo.
47,Joey, Oh. What do you do?
48,Chandler, I can’t believe you don’t know what I do for a living!
49,Phoebe," Yeah, I actually don’t know..."
50,Ross," Good, so do I"
51,Rachel, Something to do with numbers?
53,Phoebe," Oh my God! No! Shoo! Kitty! No! No-no-no! Shoo! Come on, you! (goes over
and picks up the cat) Come on. Crazy. (looks into the cat’s eyes) Oh my God."
54,Rachel, What?
55,Phoebe, Nothing. Nothing.
56,Joey, What? What’s wrong?
57,Phoebe," I just, I just have this really strong feeling that this cat is my
Mother."
58,Rachel, You mean the mom you met in Montauk. She was a cat?!
59,Phoebe," No, no-no, she was a human lady. This is the spirit of my Mom
Lily, the one who killed herself."
60,Ross," Are you sure she’s in the cat, or have you been taking your
grandma’s glycoma medicine again?"
61,Phoebe," No Dr. Skeptismo! I’m sure. First of all, okay, there’s the
feeling. (Chandler shrugs) Okay, and for another, how about the fact that she went into my
guitar case which is lined with orange felt. (Rachel nods her head in unsure agreement) My
Mother’s favourite fish is Orange Roughy... (Joey thinks he understands, but then
nods that he has no clue.) Cats....like....fish! (Ross and Rachel are totally lost) (to
the cat) Hi, Mommy. (Rachel covers her mouth, in an “Oh my God.” gesture) Oh, I
haven’t seen this smile in 17 years!"
62,Joey," (to Chandler) Dude, Phoebe’s mom has got a huge peni..."
63,Chandler, (interrupting) Let it go!!
65,Monica, Hey!
66,Rachel," Umm, when were you gonna tell me that you’re going out with Chip
Matthews?"
67,Monica, Now? Is it okay if I go out with Chip Matthews?
68,Rachel," Nooo! It’s not okay! I can’t believe you would want to after
what he did to me!"
69,Monica," What, that little thing at the prom?"
70,Rachel," Monica! I couldn’t find him for two hours! He was having sex with
Amy Welch!"
71,Monica," Come on, that was back in high school! How could that still bother you?"
72,Rachel," I mean why, of all people would you want to go out with Chip?!"
73,Monica," Look, you and I went to different high schools..."
74,Rachel," Okay, that doesn’t help me, because we went to the same high
school."
75,Monica," You went to one where you were popular, and you got to ride off
Chip’s motorcycle, and wear his letterman jacket. I went to one where I wore a band
uniform they had to have specially made."
76,Rachel, (shocked) They had to have that specially made?!
77,Monica, It was a project for one of the Home Ec classes.
78,Rachel," (stunned) Oh my God, they told us that was for the mascot!"
79,Monica," Back then, I thought that I would never, ever get the chance to go out
with a Chip Matthews, and now he’s-he’s called me up and asked me out. And the
fat girl inside of me really wants to go. I-I owe her this. I never let her eat."
80,Rachel," Oh, you go out with him. (goes over and hugs her) "
81,Monica," Oh, really?!"
82,Rachel," Yeah. Just, if it’s possible, could you leave him somewhere and go
have sex with another guy?"
83,Monica, I’ll try.
85,Ross, So you guys having any luck getting rid of the entertainment center?
86,Joey," Well, there were a couple of calls last night, but ah, I don’t think
any of them are gonna work out."
87,Chandler," Yes, Joey has a very careful screening process. Apparently, not
everyone is qualified to own wood and nails."
88,Phoebe," (is struggling with the cat) Stop it! Stop it! She keeps squirming,
trying to get away! Just like when she was alive."
89,Ross," So Pheebs, how long is your mom gonna be with us?"
90,Phoebe," Well, I’m not sure. I mean, I guess until she y'know, gets used to
the fact that there’s y'know, a new mom. Y'know, I think she’s worried that
y'know, she’s gonna, she’s gonna be replaced. (to the cat, in a funny voice)
Well, that’s not gonna happen is it? Noo. (gets up) Okay, I have to return a call in
the other room."
91,Monica, Why can’t you use the phone in here?
92,Phoebe," Well, I’m returning a call from a certain mom at the B-E-A-C-H. I
just spelled the wrong word. (goes into Monica’s room)"
93,Ross," So, guys, am I crazy, or does Phoebe’s mom remind anyone of a cat?"
94,Monica," Ross, don’t start."
95,Ross," Come on, you-you can’t tell me you actually believe that-that
there’s a woman inside that cat!"
96,Rachel, I believe it.
97,Ross, No you don’t. 
98,Rachel," Yes, I do."
99,Ross," No you do—y'know what, you’re not gonna suck me into this."
100,Rachel," Oh sure I am, because you always have to be right."
101,Ross," I do not always have to be—okay, okay. (starts to leave)"
102,Rachel, Jurassic Park could happen.
106,Joey, Pretty nice?
107,Chandler," You’ll have to pardon my roommate, he wanted to marry this."
110,Chandler," Y'know, I, I really don’t think we need a canoe."
112,Chandler," All right, just, just take the entertainment center, and then when you
get home, throw the canoe away!"
114,Joey, (to Peter) Good for you!!
116,Rachel," (entering) You guys, you’re never gonna believe what I just found
tacked up on a telephone pole! (She’s holding a flyer.) Look kinda familiar?"
117,Ross," (taking the flyer) Apparently Phoebe’s mother also goes by the name
Julio."
118,Rachel," You guys, there’s a little girl in Soho looking for this cat. I
mean, you know what that means?!"
119,Joey," (looking at the flyer) Yeah-eah! 200 dollar reward, split five ways!!"
120,Rachel, Do we have to tell her?
121,Ross," Yes, we have to tell her!"
122,Monica," Oh, but it’s made her so happy."
123,Ross," (holds up a hand) Little girl misses her cat. (hold up the other hand)
Crazy lady thinks her mother is in a cat. (gets up) Okay, y'know what, I have to go have
dinner with my son, can I trust that when you see Phoebe, you will tell her."
125,Ross, Thank you.
126,Rachel, I hate when Ross is right!
127,Monica," He is right, isn’t he?"
128,Chandler," Y'know what, I think this might be one of the times he’s wrong."
130,Chandler," Oh-no, he’s right."
133,Phoebe," (entering, with Julio) Hi. (sits down in the chair)"
134,Monica, Hi!
136,Joey," Uh, Pheebs, about your mom..."
137,Phoebe, Yeah?
138,Joey, (pause) How’s that going?
139,Phoebe," So great. Oh, we took a nap today and my Mom fell asleep on my tummy and
purred."
140,Joey," That’s so sweet. (pause) I’m gonna get some coffee. (gets up and
leaves)"
141,Monica," (sliding into Joey’s place on the couch to try and talk to Phoebe)
Huh? What’d ya say Joe? I’ll be right there. (gets up and joins Joey)"
143,Rachel, Pheebs...
144,Phoebe," I just feel so, uhh....."
145,Rachel, All right!!
146,Chandler, I’m coming already!!
147,Rachel, Jeez!
150,Monica," (running from the bathroom to her room, wearing only a towel) Not yet!
Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! (gets to her room and
closes the door, as Rachel gets up to answer the door.)"
151,Rachel," Hello, Chip."
153,Rachel," I’m great! I’m great. I’ve got a great job at Bloomingdale’s,
have wonderful friends, and eventhough I’m not seeing anyone right now, I’ve
never felt better about myself."
155,Rachel," She’ll be out in a second. So, Chip, how’s umm, Amy Welch?"
158,Joey," This is the unit for you my friend. Sturdy construction, tons of storage
compartments, some big enough to fit a grown man."
160,Joey," Oh yeah! I got in there myself once. My roommate bet me five bucks that I
couldn’t, and then he stuck a board through the handles that locked me in. Yeah. It
was funny ‘til I started feeling like I was in a coffin."
162,Joey," Oh yeah? (opens up the center and takes out the stereo) If I can’t,
I’ll knock five bucks off the price off the unit."
164,Joey, Okay. (he gets in the unit and closes the door) See?! I told ya! 
166,Joey," Sometimes I get in here just to get away from it! Hey, a nickel!!"
169,Monica, Oh my God! You still have the Chipper!
171,Monica," That’s what we used to call your ah, your motorcycle in high
school. Y'know how a motorcycle is a Chopper, and you’re Chip. Nevermind."
173,Monica, Wow! A lipper from Chipper.
175,Monica," Umm. Well, there’s Rachel, and umm, I think that’s it. How
bout you?"
177,Monica, Is that all?
179,Monica," Ohh, how is he?"
181,Monica, Isn’t he an architect now?
184,Chandler, OH MY GOD!!!
185,Joey, (still trapped in the entertainment center) WHAT?!! 
186,Chandler, Are you all right?!
187,Joey, Yeah...
188,Chandler, (lets him out) What happened?!!
189,Joey," (getting out) Awww, man! He promised he wouldn’t take the chairs!!"
190,Chandler," What the hell happened?!! How were you locked in?!! And where the hell
is all of our stuff?!!"
191,Joey," Well, this guy came by to look at the unit and-and he said he didn’t
think big enough to fit a grown man!"
192,Chandler, So—You got in voluntarily?!
193,Joey," I was tryin’ to make a sale!! Oh, man, if I ever run into that guy
again, do you know what I’m gonna do?"
194,Chandler, BEND OVER?!!!
197,Monica," Look, not that I enjoy talking about people who I went to high school
with, ‘cause I do, but umm, maybe we could talk about something else? Like you, I
don’t even know where you work?"
199,Monica, I do?
201,Monica, You still work at the multiplex?
203,Monica," Thanks, I’m set. Do you still live with your parents?"
207,Rachel, Wow! They really got you guys. Your T.V. The chairs.
208,Phoebe," Oh yeah, your microwave. The stereo."
209,Joey," (looking through a deck of cards) Aww, man, he took the five of spades!!
Oh, no-no-no, here it is!"
210,Monica, (entering) Oh my God! What happened?
211,Chandler," Oh, umm, Joey was born, and then 28 years later, I was robbed!!"
212,Rachel," (to Monica) So, how was your date?"
213,Monica," Well, y'know how I always wanted to go out with Chip Matthews in high
school?"
214,Rachel, Um-hmm.
215,Monica," Well, tonight, I actually went out with Chip Matthews in high school."
216,Rachel," Oh honey, I’m sorry."
217,Monica," No, it’s okay, not only did I get to go out with Chip Matthews, I
got to dump Chip Matthews."
218,Rachel, Ohh! That’s so great!
219,Monica, I know!
220,Ross," (entering) Hey! So ah, what did the insurance company say?"
221,Chandler," Oh, they said uh, “You don’t have insurance here, so stop
calling us.”"
222,Ross," (seeing Phoebe still with cat) You didn’t tell her?! (They all kinda
shy away.) Okay, fine! Pheebs?"
223,Phoebe, Yeah? (sees Ross) Hi!
224,Ross," Hi! Listen uhh, this cat belongs to a little girl. There are flyers all
over the place."
225,Rachel," I’m sorry, sweetie. (shows her the flyer)"
226,Monica," Hey, we can take her back with you if you want."
227,Phoebe," Ohh. Um-hmm. But y'know, she choose to find me. I mean, I have to
respect her decision. Right?"
229,Ross," No! No! Look—Hey, enough is enough! Look, I am sorry that you feel
guilty or whatever about spending time with your new mom, but this is not your old mom.
This is a cat! Okay, Julio the cat! Not mom! Cat!"
230,Phoebe," (she turns around and puts the cat on the entertainment center) Ross,
how many parents have you lost?"
231,Ross, None.
232,Phoebe," Okay, then you don’t know what it feels like when one of them comes
back. Do you? I believe this is my Mother. Even if I’m wrong, who cares? Just be a
friend. Okay? Be supportive."
233,Ross, I’m sorry.
234,Phoebe, Okay.
235,Ross, I don’t know what to say.
236,Rachel, You could.... say you’re sorry to her mom.
237,Phoebe, I think she would like that.
238,Ross," (goes over to Julio) Come here, here, come here, come here, (pause) Mrs.
Buffay. Sorry, about what I said, umm, it was, it was insensitive of me to say that you
were just a cat. When clearly you are also the reincarnated spirit, of my friend’s
mother."
239,Phoebe, Thank you. We both forgive you.
240,Rachel," So honey, what are you gonna do about the little girl?"
241,Phoebe," Yeah, okay, listen, umm, Mom, I hope you know you still mean a lot to
me. And you’re welcome to come back anytime."
242,Chandler," Pheebs, if she could come back as a couch, we’d really appreciate
it. (Joey nods in agreement)"
243,Phoebe," Come on, Mom, I’ll take you home."
244,Rachel, I’ll go with you.
245,Monica, Me too. (they all leave)
246,Ross," Oh! Y'know, I’ve got an extra futon."
247,Joey," Dude, you don’t have to brag! We got nothing here!!"
0,Joey," Hey!! We are so in luck! Treeger said that we
could have all this cool stuff from the basement. Wait right there. (Goes back into the
hall)"
1,Chandler," Oh no-no-no, I’m, I’m paddling away!"
2,Joey, (Returning carrying a couple of rusted lawn chairs) Huh?!
3,Chandler, Wow! Really?! We get all this rusty crap for free?!
4,Joey," Uh-huh. This and a bunch of bubble wrap. And,
some of it is not even popped! "
6,Chandler, Could we be more white trash?
9,Monica, (Entering from her bedroom) How desperate am I?
10,Rachel," Oh! Good thing Chandler’s not here, he always wins at
this game."
11,Monica, I just told my Mom I’d cater a party for her.
12,Phoebe, How come?
13,Monica," Because I need the money, and I thought that it’d be a
great way to get rid of that last little schmidgen of self-respect."
14,Ross," Come on, I think this is a good thing. I don’t think Mom
would’ve hired you if she didn’t think you were good at what you do."
15,Monica," You don’t have to stick up for her. She can’t here
you."
17,Rachel," (entering) Hey! Umm, do you guys have any juice?"
18,Joey, Just pickle.
19,Chandler," Hey uh, Rach, funny story. I ah, bumped into Joanna on the
street yesterday."
20,Rachel," My boss, Joanna? Wow, that must’ve been awkward."
21,Chandler," Well, no, actually she uh, asked me if I wanted to get a
drink."
22,Rachel," (laughs) You ah, you didn’t say ‘Yes’ to that
did you?"
23,Chandler, (laughs) No. No!
25,Chandler," Well, not at first."
26,Rachel, What is she doing here?
28,Rachel," I don’t understand! Last time you went out with her you
said she was a ‘big, dull dud.’"
29,Chandler," Well, I think I judged her too quickly, and this time we
were able to take the relationship to the next level."
31,Rachel," Well, last time I almost got fired. You must end it, you must
end it now!"
32,Chandler," Oh, come on! It’s not like this is an everyday
occurrence for me! I mean usually I’m pretty much just in there by myself."
34,Rachel," Chandler!! (He turns around quickly) Promise me, you will end
it."
35,Chandler," Okay, I promise, I’ll end it."
36,Rachel, Thank you.
37,Chandler," I hope you know what I’m giving up for ya, because
she’s not just the boss in your office, if you know what I mean."
38,Joey," Yeah-eh-eah! (Rachel glares at him) Oh-oh, sorry, I-I knew what
he meant."
41,Monica," Doing great, the quiches are coming along."
43,Monica," Yeah, I thought it was cute."
45,Monica, Let me ask you a question.
47,Monica, Why did you hire me?
49,Monica," (to Phoebe) Oh my God! Did you hear that? She hired me because
she thinks I’m good."
50,Phoebe," Okay, I didn’t hear that."
51,Monica," Oh yeah, she didn’t hire me out of pity, it wasn’t
so she could pick on me in front of her friends, she actually thinks I’m good."
52,Phoebe," Wow! And hey, it’s cool if you’re a lesbian! (Gives
her a thumbs up)"
55,Joey, Uhhhh. (He’s not sure)
57,Joey," No! No. But ah, try the classifieds, people sell everything in
there."
61,Ross, …I’m telling you it’s totally unconstituional.
65,Monica," …I think he deserves a Nobel Prize. (Joey starts to nod
‘Yes.’)"
68,Chandler," …it was like the Algonquin kids table. (They all laugh,
but Joey only laughs not to be left out.)"
71,Joey, Yeah-well-yeah! Yeah-oh-yeah. Come on in.
73,Phoebe, That’s weird.
74,Monica, What?
75,Phoebe, Your nails.
76,Monica," Oh, I know, I never wear fake ones. I just did it so my Mom
wouldn’t give me grief about me biting them."
77,Phoebe," Oh, no, I meant that it’s weird that you only have nine
now."
78,Monica," (Looks at her nails) Oh my God. Wait a minute, I had them
put… (realises) Oh my God! It’s in the quiche! Oh My God!"
79,Phoebe," Okay, don’t panic. I’m gonna go to the store,
I’m gonna get you another set of nails, no one’s gonna know, and you’re
gonna look great. (She runs over to get her coat.) Oh! Oh, it’s ‘cause
they’re gonna eat—that’s the problem."
81,Monica," Okay ah, please don’t freak out. Umm, but ah,
there’s a blue fingernail in one of the quiche cups, and there’s no way to know
which one."
82,Phoebe, And! Whoever finds it wins the prize!
84,Monica, Then why are you laughing?
86,Monica, What? You bet I’d lose a nail?
88,Monica, Frozen lasagnas?
90,Monica," You bet that I’d screw up?! So all that stuff about
hiring me because I was good was…"
92,Monica," You promised Dr. Weinburg, you’d never use that phrase."
94,Monica," (laughs) That’s right. My Mom doesn’t have any faith
in me! Oh, that’s hilarious! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha."
95,Phoebe, I don’t get it.
97,Monica," (interrupting) No! You have lasagnas! (Storms out and an
awkward silence follows.)"
99,Phoebe," Op, the ruined quiches are ready."
101,Chandler, It just doesn’t…feel like we’re breaking up.
103,Chandler, Okay.
106,Chandler, Thanks.
108,Chandler, Okay. (Starts to button up his shirt)
110,Chandler, I’m getting dressed.
112,Chandler, When I walk outside naked people throw garbage at me.
114,Chandler, What is it?
116,Chandler," Ah-ha, you’re not the boss of me. (She kisses him)
Yeah, you are! (She handcuffs him to the chair) Ooh, saucy."
118,Chandler," You are, you’re gonna leave me like this?"
120,Chandler," Okay. But if you don’t come back soon, (She leaves and
closes the door) there’s pretty much nothing I can do about it!"
125,Rachel," That’s weird, she locked the door."
127,Rachel," Okay, swear you won’t tell, but when Mark left he gave me
a key to Joanna’s office. Do you wanna see the list?"
130,Chandler, Hi! (to Sophie) How are you?
134,Chandler," Hello, Joanna…(Realises he doesn’t know her last
name)…’s office."
136,Chandler, How little?!
138,Chandler," Look, this isn’t funny! You get back here right now!"
140,Chandler, Why not?!
142,Chandler, What?!
146,Rachel, (answering it) (angrily) What?!
147,Chandler," (in a serious, businesslike tone) Rachel, could I see you
for a moment?"
149,Chandler," Okay, here’s the situation. The keys to the cuffs are
on the back of the door. Could you be a doll and grab them and scoot on over and unlock
me? And on a totally different subject, that is a lovely pantsuit."
150,Rachel, You promised you would break up with her!
151,Chandler," I did break up with her! She just took it really, really
well!"
152,Rachel," And the fact that you were jeopardising my career never
entered your mind?!"
153,Chandler," It did enter my mind! But then something happened that made
it, shoot right out."
154,Rachel," Y'know what Chandler, you got yourself into those cuffs, you
get yourself out of them."
155,Chandler," No-no-no-no-no-no-no!! I can’t get myself right out of
them! You must have me confused with the Amazing Chandler!! Come on, you have to unlock
me, she could be gone for hours, and I’m cold, and (Stops and looks up the skirt on a
statue behind Joanna’s desk.)"
156,Rachel," Oh, Chandler!! All right, this is it! (Grabs the key) You
never see Joanna again!"
157,Chandler, Never!
158,Rachel, You never come into this office again!
159,Chandler, Fine!
160,Rachel, You give me back my Walkman!
161,Chandler, I—never borrowed your Walkman.
162,Rachel," Well, then I lost it. You buy me one!"
163,Chandler," You got it! Here we go! Come on! This is great! (Rachel goes
over and unlocks the handcuffs) Ahhh! (He starts rubbing his wrist)"
164,Rachel, Does it hurt?
165,Chandler," No, I just always see guys doing this when they get
handcuffs taken off them. (He runs over to where his pants are hanging) Hello sweet pants!"
166,Rachel, Wait a minute! What are you gonna tell Joanna?
167,Chandler, About what?
168,Rachel," When she sees that you’re gone, she’s gonna know
that I let you out, and that I was in here, and I’m gonna get fired!"
169,Chandler," I’ll make something up! I’m good at lying, I
actually did borrow your Walkman!"
170,Rachel," No, there’s nothing to make up, she’s gonna know
that I have a key to her office, I’ve got to get you locked up back the way you were!
(She tries to drag him over to the chair, but Chandler stops her.)"
171,Chandler," Oh-ho-ho, I don’t think so!"
173,Chandler," Well, this is much better."
176,Joey, He cut off his ear.
178,Joey, I’m out.
180,Joey," Wow! That’s pretty nice. I thought he cut off his ear
‘cause he sucked. What else you got in there?"
182,Joey," In the woods. No wait-wait, that’s the joke answer."
184,Joey, Spock’s birth control.
187,Phoebe, Hey!
188,Monica, Hi.
189,Phoebe," This used to be your room? (She nods ‘Yes’) Wow! You
must’ve been in really good shape as a kid."
190,Monica," Ohh, I’m such an idiot. I can’t believe I actually
thought she could change."
191,Phoebe," Well, who cares what your Mom thinks? So you pulled a Monica."
192,Monica," Oh good, I’m glad that’s catching on."
193,Phoebe," No but, why does that have to be a bad thing. Just change what
it means. Y'know? Go down there and prove your Mother wrong. Finish the job you were hired
to do, and we’ll call that pulling a Monica."
194,Monica, What?
195,Phoebe," Okay, umm, if a kid gets straight A’s, his parents would
say, ""Yeah, he pulled a Monica."" Y'know? Or a fireman saves a baby, and they go,
""Yeah I know, he pulled a Monica."" Or someone hits a homerun and the announcer
says, ""Yeah, that one’s outta here."" Though some things don’t change."
196,Monica," (getting up) All right, I’ll go down there. But, I’m
not gonna serve the lasagna. I’m gonna serve something I make."
198,Phoebe," Wow! My breasts are really strong. (She goes and joins
Monica.)"
200,Rachel," Chandler! Chandler, please, I have to get you locked up back
the way you were, I am sooo gonna lose my job, she’s very private about her office.
Now I know why."
201,Chandler," Hey, look, you’re in trouble either way! Okay? If she
comes back and sees me locked to this instead of the chair, she’s gonna know you were
in here. So you might as well just let me go."
202,Rachel, What if I clean your bathroom for a month?
203,Chandler," It still wouldn’t be clean. (Rachel makes an ‘Eww,
disgusting!’ face) All I want is my freedom."
204,Rachel, Foot rubs for a month!
205,Chandler, Freedom!
206,Rachel," I’ll take all of your photos and put them into photo
albums!"
207,Chandler," Freedom! I want my freedom! Why won’t you here me?!
(Opens the door) Sophie, help me! Help me!! (Sophie stands up)"
208,Rachel, Sophie sit!!
210,Rachel," No! God, would you just calm down!"
212,Chandler," I’m gonna say this for the last time. Would you please
just… (He moves his arm which opens the drawer and hits in the back of the head,
which proves his point.)"
214,Joey," Wow! There’s a lot I didn’t know about vomit. (The
duck comes to the door of the bathroom, quacking.) (To the duck) In a minute. (The duck
goes back into the bathroom.)"
216,Joey," Twelve hundred dollars? You think I have $1200? I’m home in
the middle of the day, and I got patio furniture in my living room. I guess there’s a
few things you don’t get from book learnin’."
218,Joey," How about zero down and zero a month for a long, long time?"
220,Joey," You wanna see what I got? (He gets up to empty out his pockets)
Okay? I’ve got a baby Tootsie Roll, a movie stub, keys, a Kleenex, a rock, and an
army man. Hey!"
222,Joey," And a 50. (The salesman stops suddenly) Huh, these must be
Chandler’s pants."
224,Joey," Oh, I-I think I’m gonna stick with the V, I wanna see how
this bad boy turns out."
226,Rachel," I ah, will buy and wrap all of your Christmas gifts."
227,Chandler, No!
228,Rachel," I ah… Oh! I’ll squeeze you fresh orange juice every
morning!"
229,Chandler, With extra pulp?
230,Rachel, (happily) Yeah!!
231,Chandler, No!
232,Rachel, D’oh!! (pause) I’ve got it!
233,Chandler, You don’t have it.
234,Rachel," I have so got it. There’s gonna be
rumours about this, there’s no way to stop it. Sophie knows, Monica and Phoebe know."
235,Chandler, How do Monica and Phoebe know?
236,Rachel," Oh, I called them. And when they ask me what I saw, I can be
very generous (Holds her hands far apart) or very (In a high pitched voice) stingy."
237,Chandler, (intrigued) Go on.
238,Rachel," I can make you a legend. I can make you this generation’s
Milton Berle."
239,Chandler, And Milton Berle has a…
240,Rachel," Ohh, not compared to you. (Chandler nods in agreement)"
242,Monica, Well?
243,Phoebe, They’re not even touching the lasagna!
244,Monica, Really?!
245,Phoebe," Oh, they love your casserole."
246,Monica, Yes!!
247,Phoebe," It’s hard to believe that just a little while ago this
was nothing but ingredients."
249,Monica, And you?
251,Monica," So if everyone liked it, and you liked it, that would make
this a success. Which would make you…"
253,Monica," Well, I was going for wrong, but we can use your word."
255,Monica, Wow!
256,Phoebe," Umm, you might even say that she pulled a Monica. (They both
look at her) (to Monica) She doesn’t know we switched it. (Monica nods her head
‘No.’)"
258,Monica," That really means a lot. Oh, and Mom, don’t bite your
nails."
260,Chandler, (hello) Hello.
262,Monica," (in a sexy voice) Hello, Chandler. (Phoebe has a huge smile on
her face.)"
263,Chandler, (to Rachel) I love you. (Kisses her on the forehead)
264,Joey, Wh-what’s going on?
265,Phoebe, Oh. 
267,Joey, No he doesn’t!
268,Chandler," (checks his watch) Two hours, that lasted!"
269,Rachel, So did you break up with Joanna?
270,Chandler, I think so.
271,Joey," Well, it’s good thing you got out when you did, before she
blew up like that Vesuvius."
272,Ross, The volcano?
273,Joey," Yeah. And speaking of volcanoes, man are they a violent igneous
rock formation."
274,Rachel, What?!
275,Joey," Oh yeah, lava spewing, hot ash, of course some are dormant."
276,Monica, Why are you talking about volcanoes all of the sudden?
277,Joey," Well, we can talk about something else. What do you want to talk
about? Vivisection? The Vasdeferens? The Vietnam War?"
278,Monica," Oh! Did anybody see that-that documentary on the Korean War?
(Joey is pissed)"
280,Phoebe," Oh God, Korea is such a beautiful country."
281,Ross, With such a sad history.
282,Chandler, Could there be more Kims?
287,Rachel, It’s me! Good morning!
289,Rachel," Yeah, sure. Umm, they didn’t have poppy seed bagels, so
I… (Enters Joanna’s office and sees her handcuffed to her chair wearing nothing
but a slip) Oh my word!"
291,Rachel," Oh, yeah! Yeah!"
294,Rachel, Okay.
0,Phoebe," Hey! New wallet, huh?"
1,Chandler," Yeah, it was time. The old condom ring in the leather just
doesn’t say ‘cool’ anymore."
2,Monica, Rachel!
3,Rachel, What?
4,Monica, You just put an empty carton back in the fridge!
5,Rachel," Oh yeah, I know, but the garbage was full."
6,Monica, Have you ever taken out the trash? (Hands her the garbage.)
7,Rachel," Well, I thought you liked doing it. (Rachel starts out the door
and stops.)"
8,Monica, Third door on the left.
9,Rachel, Right!
11,Rachel," Oh! Hey, Mr. Treeger."
15,Rachel," Ummm. Oh! I’m sorry. (She grabs the box and offers him a piece.)
It’s a little old but…"
17,Rachel, I’m sorry. I didn’t—I don’t come in here a lot.
19,Rachel, No.
21,Rachel, I didn’t… I never said that.
23,Rachel," (starting to cry) Okay, I’m sorry. (Runs out still carrying the
pizza box.)"
25,Monica," God! If you’re gonna cry about it! (She grabs the box and goes to
through it out.]"
28,Joey," Whoa-whoa, Treeger made you cry?"
29,Rachel, Yes! And he said really mean things that were only partly true. 
30,Joey, I’m gonna go down there and teach that guy a lesson.
31,Monica," Joey, please don’t do that. I think it’s best that we just
forget about it."
32,Rachel," That’s easy for you to say, you weren’t almost just killed."
33,Joey," All right that’s it, school is in session! (Exits and slams the
door.)"
34,Monica," (Picking up a card from Chandler’s wallet.) My God! Is this a gym
card?"
35,Chandler," Oh yeah, gym member. I try to go four times a week, but I’ve
missed the last 1200 times."
36,Ross, So why don’t you quit?
37,Chandler," You don’t think I’ve tried? You think I like having
50 dollars taken out of my bank account every month? No, they make you go all the way down
there! Then they use all of these phrases and peppiness to try and confuse you! Then they
bring out Maria."
38,Ross, Who is Maria?
39,Chandler," Oh Maria. You can’t say no to her, she’s like this lycra
spandex covered gym…treat."
40,Ross, You need me to go down there with you and hold your hand?
41,Chandler, No!
42,Ross, So you’re strong enough to face her on your own?
43,Chandler," Oh no, you’ll have to come."
46,Joey," Hey! You hold on pal! Now you made my friend, Rachel, cry. So now,
you’re gonna go up there and apologize to her, unless you want me to call the
landlord."
48,Joey," Have you heard about a little something called, Not Making Girls Cry."
50,Joey, I have actually not heard of that.
52,Joey," Why don’t you tell me something I don’t know! (He storms out,
and once Treeger closes the door behind him, Joey makes an ‘Oops!’ have.)"
54,Phoebe," Oh please, somebody tell me I don’t have to go to work today!"
55,Monica, What’s the matter?
56,Phoebe," Oh, my first massage today is this incredibly gorgeous guy, and every
time I see him I just want to do things to him that I’m not allowed to charge for."
57,Monica, So do them for free.
58,Phoebe," Oh no, it is forbidden! No-no, Mrs. Potter fires people for fooling
around with clients. And it’s against my oath as a masseuse."
59,Ross, They make you take an oath?
60,Phoebe," No, I made myself take an oath. Yeah, no fooling around with clients and
umm, always be prepared. Yeah, that one’s actually from the Boy Scouts, but it just
makes good sense."
61,Chandler, Why don’t you just give him to somebody else?
62,Phoebe," No, I can handle it. No, I’m a professional. (She starts to leave)"
63,Rachel," Oh Pheebs, is that a new ankle bracelet?"
64,Monica, Wow! And you got a petticure. Your feet are all dressed up.
65,Chandler," Because that’s the only part of you he can see when he’s on
the table!"
66,Monica, You’re gonna do some feet flirtin’!
67,Phoebe," I don’t what your talking about. (Laughs nervously and continues to
leaqve)"
68,Ross, Then how do you explain the toe ring?!
69,Phoebe, Because it’s Arabian princess day at work! Okay?! Leave me alone!
71,Rachel, Oh! My hero! What happened?
72,Joey," Well uh, I went down there and told him that no one treats my friends like
that and that he’d better come up here and apologize. I’ll see you later.
(Starts to leave)"
73,Monica," What a minute, what did he say?"
74,Joey," He said that he wasn’t gonna apologize because you guys are living
here illegally, so instead what he’s gonna do is have you evicted—I’ll see
you later."
75,Rachel, What?! You got us evicted!!
76,Monica, I told you not to go down there!
77,Joey, Well he made Rachel cry!
78,Monica, Rachel always cries!
79,Rachel, That’s not true! (Starts to cry.)
80,Monica," Now Joey, you go down there and you suck up to him. I mean you suck like
you’ve never sucked before!"
81,Joey," All right! I’ll try! But if I can’t, you can stay with Chandler
and I until you get settled."
82,Rachel, Go!!
83,Joey," All right, all right, all right. (Starts to leave, stops, and turns
around) I mean I’ll have to check with him first, but I’ll think he’ll be
cool with it. (Monica shoos him out.)"
85,Ross," Whoa-whoa-whoa, hey! Now remember what we talked about, you gotta be
strong."
86,Chandler, Yes. (In a stronger voice) Yes!
87,Ross," One more time, ""Hey, don’t you want a washboard stomach and rock
hard pecs?"""
88,Chandler, No! I want a flabby gut and saggy man breasts!
89,Ross, Good! That’s good!
90,Chandler, Okay. (They go inside) (To the guy at the desk) I wanna quit the gym.
92,Chandler, I wanna quit the gym.
94,Chandler," (He turns to Ross and Ross makes a ‘Be strong’ sound.) I
wanna quit the gym."
96,Ross, Me? No.
98,Chandler," (horrified at the prospect of trying to quit alone and unsure about
himself) I wanna quit the gym."
99,Ross," It’s okay man, be strong. (Chandler goes into the office.)"
101,Ross," No! And I’m not gonna be, so you can save you little speech."
108,Phoebe, These old things.
110,Phoebe," You mean the—Okay by siadic, you mean the towel covered portion."
112,Phoebe," Sure, yeah, no I can do that, yeah, because umm, y'know, the muscles in
the siadic area can get y’know, real (lifts up the towel) nice and tight. So umm,
tell me Rick, how umm, how did you injure the area."
114,Phoebe," Oh. (She goes to work, and her head slowly drops out of view.)"
116,Phoebe, No!
119,Joey," Please don’t kick Monica and Rachel out, this wasn’t there
fault, it was mine."
121,Joey," No you can’t do that, where would the chick and the duck live?"
123,Joey," Noo-no-no, no, those are nicknames. I’m the chick and Chandler is the
duck."
125,Joey," Come on man, just-just let the girls stay, I’ll do whatever you want."
127,Joey," Yeah-yeah, absolutely."
129,Joey," What, what is it?"
131,Joey," That’s not, prison lingo, is it?"
134,Monica, His dancing partner?!
135,Joey," Yeah, there’s this superintendent’s dance, the Super Ball. I
don’t know, and he wants to impress Marge, this lady super that he’s a crush on."
136,Rachel," Well, why doesn’t he practice with a girl?"
137,Joey," Well, he’s too shy, he doesn’t thing he’s good enough to
dance with girls yet."
138,Rachel," Yeah, right, he almost danced me right down that…garbage chute.
(Starts to cry)"
139,Monica," Oh, would you let it go already?! You’re fine!"
141,Chandler, Hey.
142,Rachel," Hey! So, did you quit?"
143,Chandler," No, I almost did, couldn’t leave Ross there without a spotter!"
144,Monica," Wait, now so you joined the gym?"
146,Ross," And that’s funny, why?"
147,Rachel," Oh, umm, I was just y’know working out and umm… Oh,
that’s it."
148,Chandler," We’re doomed. Okay, they’re gonna take 50 bucks out of our
accounts for the rest of our lives. What are we gonna do?"
149,Monica," Well, you could actually go to the gym."
151,Ross," Or! Or, we could go to the bank, close our accounts and cut them off at
the source."
152,Chandler, You’re a genius!
153,Joey," Aww, man, now we won’t be bank buddies!"
154,Chandler," Now, there’s two reasons."
155,Phoebe, (entering) Hey.
157,Phoebe," Ohh, you guys, remember that cute client I told you about? I bit him."
158,Rachel, Where?!
159,Phoebe, On the touchy.
160,Ross, And that’s not against your oath?!
161,Phoebe," No, I know! I-I’m sorry, but the moment I touch him, I just wanna
throw out my old oath and take a new, dirty one."
162,Monica," Well, next time your massaging him, you should try and distract
yourself."
163,Joey," Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Like-like when I’m doing something exciting and I
don’t wanna get too excited, I just ahh, y’know try to thing of other
things like ah sandwiches, and ah baseball, and ah Chandler!"
164,Chandler," Thank you, Joey."
165,Joey," No-no, thank you."
167,Joey," All right, I’m here, let’s ahh, get this over with."
169,Joey," Whoa-whoa, don’t we need to do some kinda preparation first? Like
ahh, get really drunk?"
173,Joey," No, it’s okay, but if I’m Marge, my breasts are coming out my
back."
175,Joey," Come on man, you’re not a potato."
177,Joey," Come on Treeger, don’t say that. You just ahh, you just need more
practice. Here, come on, let’s ahh, let’s try it again. Come on. (they start
dancing again) Plus, it was, it was probably mostly my fault, anyway. I mean, y’know,
I’m not really that comfortable dancing with a—(Treeger throws him) We-he!! Hey!"
180,Monica," Hey-hey, how goes the dancing? Gay yet?"
181,Joey," Ah-ha-ha, you guys owe me big time. (He walks into the kitchen and does a
little dance step on the way.)"
182,Rachel, (laughing) What was that?
183,Joey, What?
184,Rachel, You just did a little dancy thing.
185,Joey, No I didn’t.
186,Monica, Yes you did! You did like a little hop.
187,Rachel, You are soo enjoying this.
188,Joey," No, I’m not! And it wasn’t a hop it was a pademarie. "
189,Monica, (laughing harder) You know the words! You are so into this!
190,Joey," All right, well maybe I’m enjoying it a little bit. I mean I’m
getting pretty good at it."
191,Rachel," Ooh, this is soo sweet, Joey our little twinkle-toes."
192,Joey," Hey-hey, hold on, this isn’t some kind of like girly dance. All
right, it’s like a sport, it’s manly!"
193,Monica," All right, then show me some manly moves."
194,Joey, All right.
196,Joey, I don’t know how to lead.
198,Ross, Hello.
199,Chandler, Hi.
200,Ross, We’d like to close our accounts.
202,Ross, No-no.
203,Chandler," No, we’d just like to close them."
206,Chandler, I wanna quit the bank!
208,Phoebe," (thinking to herself) Okay, baseball. Rick, playing baseball. Okay,
slides into second, maybe even his pants come down a little… Oh no—wait no, no!
No! Okay, all right, sandwiches, sandwiches. Umm, okay, on a plate, maybe Rick’s
pants come down a little. No! No! Okay, Chandler! Okay Chandler, ooh, that’s working."
210,Phoebe," (thinking to herself) Chandler’s knees. Chandler’s…
ankles. Chandler’s ankle hair. (notices the clock) Oh no. (to Rick) Okay, you’re
all set."
212,Phoebe, Yeah! In… really long hour world.
214,Phoebe," Ugh, okay, I have an enormous crush on you. But because you’re a
client, I can’t ask you out, even though you give me y’know, the feeling."
216,Phoebe, Really?!
219,Phoebe, What?
221,Phoebe," (laughs) Okay, quit down. (they start to kiss again)"
226,Phoebe," Oh yeah, oh and I know, but this isn’t what it looks like,
‘cause Rick is my ahh, husband."
228,Phoebe," Yes, I will tell her."
230,Monica, So you didn’t leave the bank?
231,Ross," No! And somehow, we ended up with a joint checking account."
232,Rachel, What are you ever gonna use that for?!
233,Chandler, To pay for the gym.
235,Chandler, Hey.
236,Phoebe," Hey! So I had a great day, Rick and I really hit it off, and we started
making out, and then my boss walked in and fired me for being a whore."
237,Joey, What?!
238,Rachel, You got fired?! 
239,Monica, Oh my Gosh!
240,Phoebe," It’s so weird, I have never been fired from anything before!"
241,Rachel, Sweety...
242,Phoebe," I just-I just started walking around not knowing what to do next,
y’know? I-I started asking people on the street if they wanted massages. Then these
policemen, thought I was a whore too. It’s been a really bad day, whore wise."
245,Chandler, Yeah… Bunny-rabbit.
246,Joey," (To Mr. Treeger) So you ah, ready for our last practice?"
248,Joey," Look, you wanna use our place?"
251,Joey, We did it!!
253,Joey," I know, it was amazing! I mean, we totally nailed it, it was beautiful."
255,Joey," Oh well, okay, good luck."
257,Joey, Unless you wanna practice the Foxtrot again? Or-or the Tango?
259,Joey, Okay.
261,Joey, Go get ‘em Treeger.
263,Joey, (intrigued) Really?
265,Joey," No, I’m good."
270,Phoebe," Yeah, they thought I was a whore."
272,Phoebe, Great! Thank you very much.
0,Ross," (picking up the slip of paper) Hello! What's this? Oh right its that
girl's phone number. (Rachel ignores him) Yeah-yeah, there it is, just a phone number a
really hot girl gave me. (He holds it so that Rachel can see it, she continues to ignore
him) It's no big deal, I mean it is her home phone number, but...(Rachel still ignores
him) Whoa! (Throws it in her lap) Whoa-whoops, I almost lost this baby! Yeah, the lovely
Amanda gives me her number and I-I go and drop it. (He waves it in front of Rachel's face.
Then suddenly Phoebe has to sneeze and Rachel quickly grabs the slip of paper and gives it
to Phoebe for her to sneeze into.)"
1,Phoebe, Thank you.
5,Rachel, Yeah?
7,Rachel," May fifth, why?"
9,Ross," Oh, mine's December..."
12,Chandler," Ohh, she's pretty. Pretty ahh, pretty girl, the pretty--she's pretty."
13,Monica," Just go up to her and ask her out. (Chandler laughs) Oh, what's the
worst thing that could happen?"
14,Chandler, I could die.
15,Ross," Yeah, it's-it's tough being single. That's why I'm so glad I found Amanda."
16,Rachel," Ross, you guys went out once. You took your kids to Chucky Cheese,
and you didn't even kiss her."
18,Chandler, I tell people secrets. It makes them like me.
19,Phoebe, (entering) Oh.
20,Chandler, Hey! (Phoebe sneezes)
21,Monica," Phoebe! You're sick, you shouldn't play. You should just go home, get in
bed, and stay there."
22,Phoebe," (in a nasally voice, from her cold) But I'm unemployed, my music is all
I really have now. Well music, and making my own shoes. (She puts her shoe on the table,
and it's horribly decorated) Pretty, huh? (Sneezes)"
23,Chandler," All right, I'm gonna do it! I'm gonna get shot down. Any advice?"
24,Monica," Just be yourself. But, not too much."
25,Chandler, (gets up) (softly) Wish me luck.
26,Ross, (loudly) Good luck!
27,Chandler," Wish it! (To the woman, Kathy, he likes) Hi. Hi, I-I was just sitting
over there, and uhh, Chandler. My name is Chandler. Did I say that?"
29,Chandler," Uh Kathy, with K or a C?"
31,Chandler, Oh-oh-hey!
33,Chandler," Hey, come on, give me a break, I'm out on a limb here."
35,Joey, Hey!
36,Chandler," Hey! Hey, hey-hey, hey. (Joey kisses Kathy.)"
37,Joey," Hey, I see you guys already met, huh?"
38,Chandler," Yes-yes, I was just trying to figure out a way to uh, demonstrate how
I could get my exceptionally large feet into my even bigger mouth."
39,Joey, Didn't I tell ya? Always showin' off.
40,Phoebe," Before I start, I just wanna say that umm, I have a cold, so if I sneeze
in the middle of song, it's not on purpose. Oh, except the last verse of Pepper People.
(Starts to sing) Smelly cat, smelly cat. What are they feeding you? (Stops
singing) This chick sounds good. (Singing) Smelly cat, smelly--(stops singing)
Hey Gunther, be a good little boy and bring me a whiskey."
42,Chandler, (sees Kathy is up watching TV) Hi!
44,Chandler," Jeez, at 230 in the morning, I didn't expect to have to fight over
the remote."
46,Chandler, Oh my God! That's why I got up too!
48,Chandler," Hey, listen, I'm sorry about this afternoon, y'know, if I would've
known you guys were... I never would've..."
50,Chandler," So ah, Joey tells me you two met in acting class."
52,Chandler," That's a good thing actually, because ah, he used to have me rehearse
with him."
54,Chandler, Is it on?
56,Chandler, Hey! (Runs over and gets his wonder broom)
58,Chandler, Oh! It's on! It's on!
60,Chandler, There we go little fella.
62,Chandler, Well the duck can swim.
65,Phoebe," (singing, drunk) My sticky shoes, my sticky-sticky shoes, why do you
stick on me, ba-a-by! Thanks for the lights honey. "
67,Monica, That cold makes you sound so great.
68,Phoebe," It's fun, God I love how sexy I am. (Coughs really loudly.)"
69,Joey," Oh, Kath, we should get going. We're going to by hamsters."
72,Rachel," Well, have fun!"
74,Phoebe," Well, I think it's great that the medical community is finally trying to
help sick hamsters."
75,Monica," Y'know what, I like Kathy."
76,Chandler," Oh yeah, me too, she's so cool and pretty."
77,Rachel," Yeah, she's..."
78,Chandler," She's smart and funny, y'know? We were up all last night talking, she
said the funniest thing about--what? "
79,Rachel, You love her.
80,Chandler," No, I don't."
81,Phoebe," Yes, you do. Chandler loves Kathy."
82,Ross," Come on, Pheebs lay off him."
83,Chandler," Thank you, Ross."
84,Ross," Yeah, he's a little sensitive right now, `cause he's so in love."
85,Chandler, All right.
87,Chandler, All right.
88,Monica," (turning around and doing that, ""I'm making out with someone,""
thing with her hands) Ooh, umm, oh Kathy! Kathy, I love you! Oh! (She turns around and
sees Gunther staring at her and stops suddenly.)"
90,Phoebe," So, I need to write some depressing stuff to go along with my new floozy
voice, but nothing that sad has ever really happened to me."
91,Monica," Oh umm, how about your mom dying, or having to live on the streets when
you were 14?"
92,Phoebe," Uh-huh. Oh, yeah, I could write about the time my hair did that
""Woo-hoo"" thing."
93,Ross, (entering) Hey!
94,Monica, Hey!
95,Phoebe, Hey.
96,Ross, (loudly) So I'm going over to Amanda's tonight!
97,Monica, Rachel's not here.
98,Ross, Oh.
99,Monica, How's it going with her?
100,Ross," Great, actually. I'm thinking tonight, maybe the night. Yeah, I mean ah,
the kids are gonna play together and then when they're asleep, I'm thinking Amanda and I
break open a bottle of wine, and do a little ""playing"" ourselves."
101,Rachel," (entering, with a guy) Hi guys! This is Josh. Josh, these are my
friends, and that's Ross."
102,Monica," Hi, Josh."
103,Phoebe, Hi.
105,Monica," So, did you play in college? (She points to his NYU Soccer (football for
the rest of the world) sweatshirt he's wearing.)"
107,Rachel," Ross, didn't you ah, play soccer in High School? Oh no wait, that's
right. You just organized their game schedules on your Commodore 64."
109,Rachel," Okay. (He starts to leave, and Rachel grabs him and gives him a
passionate kiss.) I'll miss you."
111,Phoebe," Wow, cute one!"
112,Monica, Very!
113,Rachel," I know, isn't he great? It's so nice to finally be in a fun
relationship, y'know? There's nothing boring about him, and ah, I bet he's never set foot
in a museum."
114,Ross," Well maybe he'll get to go soon, like on a class trip or something."
115,Rachel," Y'know what else is really great about him, oh, what is the word for the
adult that doesn't have dinosaur toys in their bedroom?"
116,Ross, Oh! (He bangs his fists together.)
117,Rachel, What was that?
118,Ross, Monica knows.
119,Monica," It's this dumb thing that Ross made up `cause he was trying to fool our
parents. It's a way of giving the finger, without actually having to give it. I remember I
cried the night you made it up, `cause it was the first time that I realized that I was
actually cooler than my older brother."
120,Ross," Well, I'm gonna go get ready, (Gives Monica the fist thing.) for my date
tonight, so ah, I'll just_ head."
121,Phoebe," Yeah, I should go to, `cause I'm playing in one hour. Hey, (clears her
voice and in her normal voice) you guys should come hear me, ooh hear me. Ooh, (tries to
sing) My sticky shoes--eww! Eww! I lost my sexy phlegm!"
124,Ross, Hi!
126,Ross, Wow! You-you look great!
128,Ross, (she lets him in) Okay! (to her son) Hey Tommy.
130,Ross," Oh no-no-no, it's my pleasure."
132,Ross, What?
134,Ross, I-I-I...
136,Ross, Who wants to make some long distance calls?
138,Chandler," Kathy! Kathy! Hi!! Kathy! Kathy! (She doesn't hear him and keeps
running, Chandler starts chasing her as the theme to The Mod Squad starts to
play. First, a car almost hits him and then gets mustard splashed on him as he runs by a
hot dog vendor.) Kathy! (He keeps running and gets tangled up in the leashes of five dogs,
in desperation he throws his paper.) Fetch! Fetch it! (He frees himself and resumes the
chase) Kathy! Kathy! Kathy! (He now trips and falls into a pile of garbage, he tries to
get up and scream her name again but he has a piece of spinach in his mouth. He gets out
of the garbage and starts crossing the street by running over the hoods of a couple of
cabs.) Kathy! (He jumps in front of her and out of breath he says) Kathy."
140,Chandler," Oh, I just wanted to say, ""Hey!"""
142,Chandler, Okay. (He walks away disgusted with himself.)
145,Monica, Oh come on! You're making it sound worse than it actually was.
146,Ross, Her date tipped me ten dollars. (Monica laughs)
148,Ross," Pheebs, what are you doing?"
149,Phoebe," Okay, I wanna be sexy again so I'm trying to catch a cold. It should be
easy, supposedly they're pretty common."
150,Monica," Phoebe, you'll catch pneumonia."
151,Chandler, (entering) Okay. You were right. I'm in love with Joey's girlfriend.
152,Phoebe, What?!
153,Ross, Are you serious?
154,Phoebe," Well, how-how-how is that possible? You barely know her!"
155,Chandler," I don't know. I can't--I just, I can't get her out of my head. Y'know?
I mean, I'm a very bad person. I'm a very, very bad person. I'm a horrible person. (he
waits for a reaction, when he doesn't get one) No you're not Chandler! We still love you
Chandler!"
156,Monica," (sneezes) Oh gosh, Phoebe, I think I caught your cold."
157,Phoebe," You mean you stole it! (Monica sneezes again) Don't cover your mouth
when you do that!"
159,Joey, Hey.
161,Chandler, Really?!
162,Joey," Yeah-yeah, I told her about the time you got drunk and fell asleep with
your head in the toilet."
163,Chandler, (laughs) Right in there!
165,Chandler," 99...100! Ready or not, here I come! (He opens his eyes and sees that
the chick and the duck are still sitting in front of him) All right, let's go over the
concept one more time."
166,Joey, (entering) Hey!
167,Chandler, Hey!
168,Joey," Hey guys. (to Chandler) Listen uh, you wanna get some dinner with me and
Kathy tonight?"
169,Chandler," Ohh, umm, y'know what, I already ate."
170,Joey, It's 430.
171,Chandler," Y'know I had a big meal on Monday, y'know. So that's just gonna get me
straight through the week."
172,Joey," Okay, I see what's going on here."
173,Chandler, You-you do?
174,Joey, Yeah! You don't like Kathy.
175,Chandler, You got me.
176,Joey," Yeah, you've been avoiding her ever since we started going out. Look, I
made an effort to like Janice, now I think it's your turn to make an
effort to like Kathy by going out to dinner with us. Right?"
177,Chandler, Yeah. Right.
178,Joey," Good, and hey! My treat. (He turns to go into his bedroom then stops.) But
that's only because you're not eating anything, right?"
179,Chandler, Okay.
181,Monica, (lying on the couch suffering from her cold) Ross isn't here.
182,Rachel," Oh. (She tries to walk away from Josh, by he keeps holding her) Stop it!"
184,Rachel," Yeah! (Monica gives a sarcastic thumbs up) (Josh leaves) I am soo gonna
marry that guy. (looking in her wallet) Ohhh!"
185,Monica, What?
186,Rachel, I think he's stealing from me.
187,Monica, Why?
188,Rachel, Because he's stealing from me!
189,Phoebe," (entering) Hi! It's me. And soup. (to Rachel) Hey, I just saw Josh, he
looks so yummy in your leather jacket."
190,Rachel, Ughh! (Storms out after him)
191,Phoebe," (to Monica) Here, now I don't eat chicken, so it's just noodle soup. And
there's no chicken in the broth either, so it's really just... noodle water. "
192,Monica, Thank you so much Phoebe.
193,Phoebe, (picking up Monica's used Kleenex and putting some in her pocket.) Sure.
194,Monica, What are you doing with those?!
195,Phoebe," But, I need your germs! I want my cold back! I miss my sexy voice."
196,Monica," Sorry, Phoebe."
197,Phoebe, It's okay. How's the soup?
198,Monica," Umm. (nodding her head, ""Good."")"
200,Monica, Ohhhh!! Gross!!
203,Joey, Is she great or what?
205,Chandler," Ohh, she's-she's not really my type."
207,Chandler," Y'know what I think it is? It's the fishnet stockings. Y'know?
Whenever I see a girl in fishnet stockings it reminds me of my father in fishnet
stockings."
209,Chandler," Uhh, no-no thanks."
211,Chandler," Listen, I-I'm gonna grab a beer. (Leaves)"
212,Joey, (to Kathy) I'll be right back. (to Chandler) What was that?
213,Chandler, What?
214,Joey," Kathy was being really nice and you just walked away. I thought we had a
deal."
215,Chandler," Hey, look, what do you want from me?"
216,Joey," I want you to like her! But if that's too damned difficult for you, then
the least you can do is pretend."
217,Chandler, I am pretending.
218,Joey," Well then, do it better!"
219,Chandler," Okay, what do you saw I go over there and say how much I like her?
(Joey gives him a thumbs up) No-no it'll be good, I can tell her much I've been thinking
about her. That I haven't stopped thinking about her since the moment I met her. That I'm
so fantastically, over-the-top, wanna-slit-my-own-throat in love with her, that for every
minute of every hour of every day I can't believe my own damn bad luck that you met her
first!!"
220,Joey," Well, that's pretty good. But you might wanna tone it down a little."
222,Ross," (entering) Hey! So, uhh, Amanda just-just dropped me off. Yeah, that's one
of the things I love about her, she's...uh, she's old enough to drive. (to Monica) So uhh,
I guess you're not going to mom and dad's tonight?"
223,Monica," No, sorry."
224,Rachel, Well where's Amanda?
225,Monica," Hey Rach, could you get me some cough drops?"
226,Rachel," I mean y'know, I'm thinking. You could bring her, and you guys could go
up to your old room, and not make out."
227,Monica," Ross, cough drops, please?"
228,Ross, At least I know she's not going out with me to get into R rated movies.
229,Rachel," Why don't you just marry her? Oh no, wait a minute you can't, I'm sorry
I forgot, she's not a lesbian."
230,Ross, You see Amanda and I have a very special...
231,Monica," (interrupting) You have nothing! You're not even going out! You're her
baby sitter! You have a 12-year-old girl's job!"
232,Rachel," (laughing) Ohh, that is soo sad."
233,Monica," And what are you laughing at, Miss
`My-keg-sucking-boyfriend-is-stealing-from-me!'"
235,Rachel," Hey, so he stole a couple bucks from me! At least he bought me something
with it! (Shows her, her ring)"
236,Monica," That's mine!! Now, would you both please start acting like adults? And
get me my cough drops!"
237,Ross, Fine.
238,Rachel, Sorry.
239,Ross," Here. (Hands her, her cough drops) (to Rachel) At least I made ten bucks
in my relationship."
240,Rachel, Y'know...
243,Phoebe," (singing) Platting goats are platting. Platting down the street.
Platting goats are platting, leaving little treats. (to Gunther) Does it even work
without my sexy voice?"
245,Phoebe," Gunther, kiss me."
249,Joey," (opening the door wearing nothing but a sock, and holding a dart board
over the `Little General.') Hey! (Chandler turns down the TV) Now, we're not actually
gonna be sleeping in her, but do you mind?"
251,Chandler, Can I sleep on your couch?
255,Phoebe," (singing) And I'm still waiting for my paper mache man. Thank
you my babies."
258,Rachel, Yeah.
260,Rachel, No!
262,Rachel, (confused) Okay.
264,Rachel, (really confused) Okay.

0,Chandler," (entering in a bathrobe) I just walked in the bathroom and saw Kathy
naked! It was like torture!"
1,Ross," Y'know if we ever go to war and you’re captured, you’re in for a
big surprise."
2,Chandler," It just keeps getting worse and worse! Y'know? I mean it’s bad
enough that I’m in love with my roommates girlfriend—which by the way, I think
she knows. Because every time we’re in the room together there’s this weird like
energy between us. And call me crazy, but I think she likes me too. And now I have seen
her naked. I mean at least when I’ve seen her with clothes on, I could imagine her
body was like covered in boles or something. But there are no boles, she’s smooth!
Smooth! (leaves)"
4,Phoebe, Wow! Could everyone totally see up his robe?
9,Joey," Great! All right, so I’ll call you later."
11,Chandler, (rushing up) Hey-Hey-Hey! Who was that?
12,Joey, That would be Casey. We’re going out tonight.
13,Chandler," Goin’ out, huh? Wow! Wow! (Does a little celebration dance) So
things didn’t work out with Kathy, huh? Bummer."
14,Joey," No, things are fine with Kathy. I’m having a late dinner with her
tonight, right after my early dinner with Casey."
15,Chandler, (shocked) What?
16,Joey," Yeah-yeah. And the craziest thing is that I just ate a whole pizza by
myself! (Laughs)"
17,Chandler, Wait! You’re going out with Kathy!
18,Joey, Yeah. Why are you getting so upset?
19,Chandler," Well, I’m upset—for you. I mean, having sex with an endless
line of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you. (He can’t believe he just
sad that.)"
20,Joey, What is the big deal? It’s not like we’re exclusive.
21,Chandler," Look, Joey, Kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs. But
Casey, I mean granted I only saw the back of her head, but I got this sense that
she’s-she’s smart, and funny, and gets you."
22,Joey, You got all that from the back of her head?
23,Chandler," All right look, I think it’s time for you to settle down. Y'know?
Make a choice, pick a lane."
24,Joey, Who’s Elaine?
26,Phoebe," (singing) ""Little, tiny Tarzan, swinging on a nose hair.
Swinging with the greatest of ease…"" Darn it! Now, I don’t know who to
get to the next verse."
27,Ross," Oh, you could just go uh, ""greatest of ease… (plays air
guitar) BAH-bah-bha-bhannn."" Then go right into it."
28,Phoebe," Yeah, ooh, I like that! Yeah. Wait! How do you know about
‘bah-bah-bha-bhan?’"
29,Ross," Well umm, y’know, I used to play."
30,Phoebe," Oh yeah, that’s right, the keyboards, huh?"
31,Ross," Yeah, just a little in high school, but then I really got into it in
college. I mean that’s-that’s when I really found my sound."
33,Monica," Oh God! Orange juice just came out of my nose, but it was totally worth
it. Oh my God, I completely forgot about your sound."
34,Ross, Yeah.
35,Monica," He used to lock himself in the basement for hours. No one was every
allowed to hear, ""The Sound."""
36,Phoebe," I wanna hear ""The Sound."""
37,Ross," Really? No. I mean, nah, I haven’t played in so long, and-and, well
it’s-it’s really personal stuff, y’know?"
38,Phoebe," Come on, play that funky music white boy."
39,Monica, Yeah!
40,Ross," No, you guys, I mean my keyboards are all the way up in—No, yeah,
okay. (Runs out.)"
42,Ross," Okay, guys."
43,Chandler," All right! Bring it on, you…"
44,Ross," Here we go. (Plays one note) Y’know, I’ve-I’ve never played
my stuff for anyone before, so it’s important that-that you understand it’s
about communicating very private emotions. (Plays another note) Y’know, umm, you
should-you should think of umm, my work as wordless sound poems. That’s what
I’m…"
45,Chandler, (interrupting) Oh my God! Play!
47,Monica," (At a loss for words) Boy, that was-that was, umm… terrific."
48,Chandler," Really, bitchin’!"
49,Phoebe," Wow, it was so—wow!"
50,Ross," Really?! I mean, really?!!"
51,Rachel," Yeah, I mean, you should play in public!"
52,Ross," Wow! Thanks, you guys. That’s uh—ohhh, I wanna, I wanna play you
another piece! Umm! Uh-oh! I left my uh, helicopter sounds on another disk. I’ll be
right back! Okay? (Runs to fetch them) This is so nice, I’m—I am so…
(starts to break up and leaves)"
53,Monica, Oh God bless my dad sound proofing the basement!
54,Rachel," Oh, I can’t believe I ever let him touch me with those fingers."
55,Phoebe," What are you guys talking about, I loved it! It was soo moving. Oh, plus
it’s just, it’s so different from the stuff you usually hear."
56,Chandler," You mean like, music?"
58,Chandler," Yeah, I know what you’re thinkin’! Yes, yes, your breasts
are just as firm and juicy."
60,Chandler, Come in!
62,Chandler," Uh yes, but uh, I just watch it for the articles."
64,Chandler," No-no, he’s not back yet, but he’ll be here any minute. So
uh, come on in. Have a seat. Bow or stern?"
66,Chandler," I like it in the stern. (Realizes what he just said.) …of the
boat. (The phone rings, and he answers it.) (on phone) Hello."
67,Joey," (on the other end at a pay phone) Hey, it’s me. Listen Casey and I
were on our way back and had a little car trouble."
68,Chandler, What happened?
69,Joey," We broke down on the Parkway, so I have to walk back and get some
transmission fluid. And hey, listen could you please tell Kathy that I’ll be there as
soon as I can."
70,Chandler, Why can’t you tell her?
71,Joey," ‘Cause I only have one quarter, and I think my time is about
to—(he stops talking suddenly)"
72,Chandler, Joey! Joey!!
73,Joey, Yeah?
74,Chandler, I thought your time ran out.
75,Joey," Me too, but I guess I do have a couple of more—(his time runs out for
real)"
76,Chandler," (to Kathy) Uhh, that was Joey. He’s running a little late, he
says he’s sorry."
78,Chandler," So I guess it’s just uh, you and me then."
80,Chandler," Yeah, I think it is!"
82,Chandler," Oh, I had an appointment to get my haircut…"
84,Chandler, …and then it got canceled.
86,Chandler, Really?! You do that?
88,Chandler," Dog grooming huh? Okay, just don’t make my tail too poofy."
91,Chandler," Well, thanks. I grow it myself. (Kathy is running her fingers through
his hair, and Chandler catches himself enjoying it too much.) Y’know who also has
great hair is Joey!"
94,Chandler, What-what ‘cha doin’?
96,Chandler, ‘Kay.
99,Chandler," (jumping up to answer the phone) Oh the phone! The phone’s making
sounds! (On phone) Hello!"
100,Joey," (on phone) Hey dude, it’s me."
101,Chandler, Hey it’s Joey!
102,Joey," Listen uh, I’m really sorry, it looks like I’m gonna be stuck
here for a while. I got the transmission fluid, but when I went to put it in the car, the
transmission wasn’t there!"
103,Chandler, What?
104,Joey," Yeah, it must’ve fallen out a few blocks back. I just figured we hit
a dog."
105,Chandler, Okay.
106,Joey," Listen uh, could you put Kathy on, I wanna apologize."
107,Chandler, Oh yeah man. (to Kathy) Joey. (Hands her the phone.)
109,Chandler, Yeah. Yes! Yeah. 
112,Chandler, Oh. 
118,Chandler," No-no-no-no, this is bad! It’s bad! This is bad!"
120,Chandler," Wait the uh, the kiss or the situation?"
122,Chandler, Okay!
124,Chandler," Ooh! Yes! Okay! Here’s what we do, we-we forget it happened."
126,Chandler," Okay, we-we swallow our feelings. Even if it means we’re unhappy
forever. Sound good?"
128,Chandler," I have to; he’s my best friend, and you’re seeing him."
130,Chandler," (interrupting) Oh-no-no-no! Don’t! Don’t! See-see,
you’re getting me confused, I’m starting to urn. "
132,Chandler, I-I think we have too.
134,Chandler," Bye. (Kathy leaves and Chandler wonders over to and leans up against
the door.) Are you still out there?"
137,Ross," (His voice is altered to sound like a computer.) Electrifying. (He plays
the sound of a ticking clock.) Emphatic time-time-time…"
138,Monica," (to Rachel and Phoebe) Y'know, there’s a Starbucks about
three blocks down."
139,Phoebe," (pushing Monica back onto the couch) It’s so inspired! Look at him!
Look at him go!"
141,Ross, (with the altered voice) Thank you guys-guys-guys…
142,Monica," (to Phoebe) Hey, aren’t you up next?"
143,Phoebe," Oh no, I’m not playing tonight."
144,Rachel, Why not?
145,Phoebe," I can’t follow Ross! It’d be like those bicycle ridding chimps
that followed The Beetles. No."
146,Monica," Phoebe, Ross sucks! "
147,Rachel," Phoebe, the place has emptied because of him."
148,Phoebe," Oh my God, he’s not even appreciated in his own time. I would give
anything to not be appreciated in my own time!"
150,Monica," Okay. Umm, Phoebe, you suck too."
151,Rachel," Yeah, Phoebe you’re… awful!"
152,Phoebe, You guys. You suck too. (She hugs them both.)
154,Joey," Aww man! I can’t believe I locked myself out again! (He knocks on the
door.)"
155,Chandler," Hang on buddy! (He goes over and unlocks the door and opens it to
reveal a fully furnished apartment.)"
156,Joey, (rushing in) Oh my God! What happened here? Did you do all this?
157,Chandler, I sure did.
158,Joey, Why?
159,Chandler," Well, I just thought it’d make me feel good to do something nice
for my friend."
160,Joey," Well, you’re amazing."
161,Chandler," Oh no-no-no. This is amazing. (He goes over and
presses a button on a remote control that opens the entertainment center doors revealing
the TV.)"
162,Joey," (very excited) A TV as if it appears from nowhere! That’s the dream!
Man, how did you afford this stuff?"
163,Chandler," Well, y’know I’m 29. I mean who needs a savings account."
164,Joey," Oh, you are the best friends anyone has ever had."
165,Chandler," Oh, I don’t know."
166,Joey," Oh-no-no-no, you are! You do this, you give me the great advice, and hey
listen, I was thinking about what you said yesterday about focusing on one woman, I’m
gonna do that."
167,Chandler, You mean with Casey.
168,Joey," No-no-no, I think I’m gonna see how things go with Kathy. She’s
pretty cool."
169,Chandler, Or Casey.
170,Joey," No-no, Kathy."
171,Chandler, Could be Casey.
172,Joey," No. No, Kathy."
173,Chandler, Consider Casey.
174,Joey," Y’know what I think? I think somebody’s got a little crush on
Casey. How ‘bout I fix you two up? What do you think?"
175,Chandler, That all the pieces of my life are falling right into place!
177,Ross, (to Phoebe) Hey!
178,Phoebe," Hey! You were really great! You were really, really great!"
179,Ross," Oh, thanks, thanks. So Monica tells me that uh, you don’t want to
play anymore because me and y'know my talent. Is that true?"
180,Phoebe," Well, kinda. Yeah. Yeah."
181,Ross, Pheebs…
182,Phoebe," Yeah, I-I can’t—I mean y’know I was trying to be really
y'know okay and upbeat about it, I just—I feel so dwarfed by your musical gift.
I…"
183,Ross," See but, Pheebs that-that is the exact opposite intent of my music.
Y’know my music is-is meant to inspire, and if it bothers you this much, then I…
I won’t play anymore."
184,Phoebe," Oh no. No-no-no, don’t do that! How could I live with myself if I
knew I was depriving the world of your music."
185,Ross," Yeah, okay."
187,Ross, Hey Chandler! Saw the new furniture. Very nice.
188,Monica, Yeah! Joey has the best boyfriend ever!
189,Chandler, I kissed Kathy.
190,Ross, What?
191,Monica, Are you serious?
192,Phoebe, Does Joey know?
193,Chandler," No. Is there anyway, anyway you think he’ll
understand this?"
194,Monica," You obviously haven’t screwed over a lot of your friends. (They all
look at her) Which we all appreciate."
195,Ross," No the-the sad thing is, if you had told him how you felt before you
kissed her, knowing Joey, he probably just would’ve just stepped aside."
196,Chandler," Oh, don’t say that! Don’t say that. That’s not true. Is
it?"
197,Phoebe," I think maybe, yeah."
198,Monica, He loves you.
199,Chandler, Then why didn’t you tell me to do that?!!
200,Ross," Well, I said-I said something to Phoebe."
201,Phoebe," Yeah! No, that’s right. And I thought it was a really good idea."
202,Rachel," I know, I remember that!"
203,Monica, I remember you did.
204,Chandler, God!! (Sits down in disgust.) What am I gonna do?!
205,Rachel," Well, Chandler, you’re gonna have to tell him."
206,Chandler, Why?! Why do I have to tell him?!
207,Rachel, Because you do.
208,Chandler," Yeah, I know."
209,Ross," Hey, would it be okay if I wrote a song about this."
211,Chandler, Hey!
212,Joey, Hey! Samboucha Margarita? 
213,Chandler, Is that a real thing?
214,Joey," Well, we only had samboucha, so it is now."
215,Chandler," Listen ah, Joe, I-I need to, I need to talk to you about something."
216,Joey, What’s up?
217,Chandler," It’s-it’s about Kathy. Umm, uh, I like her. I like her a lot
actually."
218,Joey, You do?
219,Chandler, Yeah.
220,Joey," Well, you’re timing couldn’t be better. She’s not my
girlfriend anymore."
221,Chandler, What?
222,Joey," Yeah, she broke up with me."
223,Chandler," Oh uh, when?"
224,Joey," Just now, after acting class. At first I thought she was doing some kind
of scene, that’s why I let people watch."
225,Chandler," Oh man, I am so sorry. Are, are you okay?"
226,Joey," Well, I’ve been better. But, I’m all right. So you like her huh?"
227,Chandler," Yes, but I-I uh, don’t have too."
228,Joey," No-no-no, no it’s uh, it’s okay."
229,Chandler, Yeah?
230,Joey, Yeah. You know why? ‘Cause you came to me first.
231,Chandler," Well, I thought that would be the best thing to do."
232,Joey," But hey, listen just so you know, you might have you’re work cut out
for you. ‘Cause when I talked to her, I kinda got the feeling that she’s into
some other guy. So…"
233,Chandler," See uh, that’s-that’s actually what I wanted to talk to you
about. I-I think I know who the other guy is."
234,Joey, Who?
235,Chandler, It’s me. I’m the other guy.
236,Joey, What?
237,Chandler," Yeah, I mean when you were late last night, Kathy and I got to
talking, and one thing to another and…"
238,Joey, And what?! Did you sleep with her?!
239,Chandler, No! No! No! I just kissed her.
240,Joey, What?!! That’s even worse!!
241,Chandler, How is that worse?!
242,Joey, I don’t know! But it’s the same!
243,Chandler," Look, I’m sorry! But there’s nothing I can do, I think
I’m in love with her!"
244,Joey, Who cares?! You went behind my back! I would never do that to you!
245,Chandler," You’re right, I have no excuses! I was totally over the line."
246,Joey," Over the line?! You-you’re-you’re so far past the line, that
you-you can’t even see the line! The line is a dot to you!"
247,Chandler, Yes. Yes! Right! And I feel horrible. You have to believe me!
248,Joey," Is that why you bought all this stuff?! (Chandler makes a face like
""Well, kinda."") Well, y’know what I will not watch your TV, I will not
listen to your stereo, and there’s a cinnamon raisin loaf in the new bread maker that
I’m not gonna eat! You know why?!"
249,Chandler, Probably because…
250,Joey," Because it’s all tainted with your betrayal. From now on this
apartment is empty for me! And I’m not happy about you either. (The bread maker
dings) Oh, and just so you know, I made that bread for you. (Joey walks into his bedroom
and slams the door.)"
253,Phoebe," Oh my God, he’s lost it. He’s totally lost it."
254,Monica, (removing ear plugs) What?
255,Rachel," Phoebe, his music could not get any worse. There are
rats in the basement that are hanging themselves."
257,Ross," Thank you, thanks. (Sits down next to the girls) Yeah, I lost it.
Y’know, I’m not gonna play anymore, (to Phoebe) would you, can you finish my
set?"
258,Phoebe," After that? Yeah! No, I mean if I can help."
260,Ross," Yeah, like I could lose it."
261,Rachel, What?
262,Ross, I played bad on purpose guys.
264,Monica," Okay, so you were trying to play bad this whole time."
265,Ross," Yeah—no, just that last song."
0,Joey, (answering phone) Hello.
1,Chandler," (on phone) Hey, it’s me. I know you can’t stand to be in the
same room as me, so I just thought I’d try and apologize over the phone. All I…
(Joey hangs up the phone in disgust.)"
4,Joey, (answering phone) Hello.
5,Chandler," Look I never should have kissed your girlfriend, but I’m…
(Joey hangs up the phone again.)"
8,Joey, (answering phone) Stop callin’!!
10,Joey, All right!
14,Chandler," (entering) Aww, turkey! Aww, giving thanks! Aww!"
15,Phoebe," Look everyone, it’s the spirit of Thanksgiving!"
16,Rachel, So are things with you and Joey any better?
17,Chandler," They couldn’t be worse. I spent eight hours calling him last
night, just trying to get him to talk to me."
18,Rachel," Oh wow, eight hours? So you could probably really use one of those
plug-in telephone headsets huh?"
19,Ross," Should we all expect Christmas gifts that can be stolen
from your office?"
20,Rachel, You shouldn’t.
21,Phoebe," Speaking of Christmas, umm since Monica and I are starting a new
business and have like no money, umm, this year maybe we could do secret Santa, and then
we each only buy one gift. And-and there’s the added mystery of who gets who."
22,Ross, Who gets whom. (They all look at him.) I don’t know why I do that.
24,Rachel," Well, I’m gonna take a nap, turkey makes me sleepy."
25,Monica, We haven’t eaten yet!
26,Rachel," I know, but all that work you’re doing to get it ready, I
just… (goes into her bedroom.)"
27,Chandler," Hey, by any chance did either of pick uh Rachel for your secret Santa,
‘cause I wanna trade for her."
28,Phoebe, I picked her! Oh thank God you want her! Ooh!
29,Chandler, Wow! Why do you want to get rid of her so badly?
30,Phoebe," Because she exchanges every gift she ever gets, it’s like
impossible to get her something she likes. Come on, let’s trade!"
31,Chandler," Oh that’s not true! That’s not true! I got her that backpack
and she loved it! I remember how much she was crying the day when that big dog ran off
with it… (notices the look on Monica and Phoebe’s faces.) Oh, there was no big
dog. All right this sucks! I already got her this briefcase, and I had R.G. put on
it… (Phoebe looks confused.) Her initials…"
32,Phoebe, Ohh.
33,Monica," Well, maybe you could give to somebody else. Ooh, like Ross Geller."
34,Chandler," Op, y'know what though, it’s kind’ve a girlie briefcase."
35,Monica, Who cares? He works in a museum!
36,Chandler," Hey, what time is it? The big game is about to start!"
37,Phoebe," You don’t have to do that, Ross and Joey aren’t here, you can
watch the parade if you want."
38,Chandler, Thanks.
39,Monica," What is wrong with this freezer?! (She jabs her arm into the freezer and
a piece of ice flies into her eye.) Ow! Ow!!"
40,Phoebe," God, what happened?!"
41,Monica," Oh my God, ice just got in my eye!"
42,Rachel, (standing in her doorway) People are trying to sleep in here!
43,Chandler," Monica got ice in her eye, and it hurts."
44,Phoebe," Open it up, let me see."
45,Monica," Oh, y’know what, I can’t, it really kills."
46,Chandler, Well maybe you should put some ice on it.
47,Phoebe," Ooh, God it looks bad."
48,Rachel," Honey, maybe we should take you to a doctor."
49,Monica," No, my eye doctor is Richard! I can’t go to him when I don’t
have a boyfriend!"
50,Chandler, He’s really picky about his patients.
51,Phoebe," Honey, you’ve got to go. What’s his office number?"
52,Monica, Like I remember his office number! (Pause) Speed dial 7.
53,Phoebe," (on phone) Hi! Yeah, I’m calling on behalf of Monica Geller’s
eye, and is um, is Richard Burke in today. (Listens) (to Monica) He’s out of town,
but does she want to see the on-call doctor?"
54,Monica, Yes!!
55,Phoebe, Yes! She’s very excited about that.
57,Phoebe," This is so cool, ‘til Monica gets back, it’s like I’m
head chef and I get to make all the decisions. (She looks at the remaining butter, and
then decides to add it to the dish.)"
58,Ross," Hey-hey, I thought she told you to follow the recipe exactly!"
59,Phoebe," Okay, get out of my kitchen!"
60,Chandler," (entering) All right! Okay! I think I am making some progress with
Joey, when I went into the apartment he went straight into his bedroom but he only slammed
the door once! (Ross is pleased.) I mean yeah, he gave me the finger while doing it."
61,Phoebe," All right I… I gotta call my mom and ask her a left handed cooking
question."
62,Ross," So listen ah, I picked Monica for secret Santa, but I’m already
getting her something for Chanukah, I was wondering if you wanna switch."
63,Chandler," Oh y’know what, I was already trying to trade for ah, well, you."
64,Ross," Really?! Wow! That’s-that’s so nice, what are you gonna get me?"
65,Chandler," I don’t know R.G., I was thinking something girlie for your
office."
66,Ross," Yeah, well maybe Phoebe will switch with me."
67,Chandler," Oh no-no-no, you don’t want to do that, then you’re gonna
get stuck with Rachel and she exchanges every gift she ever gets."
68,Ross," Oh, that’s not true! I’ve got her lots of stuff she never took
back."
69,Chandler, Like?
70,Ross," Like uh, that gold necklace I got her last year."
71,Chandler, When was the last time you saw her wear it?
72,Ross," Well, she wore it all Christmas day, and then uh…"
73,Chandler, Big dog?
75,Ross, (entering) Hey!
76,Joey, Hey!
77,Ross, What are you doing?
78,Joey, I’m sending back all this stuff that Chandler bought out of guilt.
79,Ross, Everything? Even the TV?
80,Joey, No! I’m putting that in my room.
81,Ross," Listen, Joey, I know what he did was wrong but don’t you think you
could at least hear the guy out?"
82,Joey," Back when you and Rachel were together, if Chandler had kissed her, would
you hear him out?"
83,Ross," That’s a good point. So uh, how long are you gonna punish him?"
84,Joey, Five years. 
85,Ross, You’ve sentenced him?!
86,Joey, Hey! Don’t do the crime if you can’t do the time.
87,Ross," Joey, the guy’s your best friend."
88,Joey," No, was my best friend. Anyway, I don’t know why
you’re pushing for him so hard. With him out of the way as my best friend,
there’s a spot open."
89,Ross," Oh, who? Me?"
90,Joey, Yeah!
91,Ross," Wow! I’m honored! And y’know what I’m gonna do as my first
act as your best friend?"
92,Joey, What?
93,Ross, I’m gonna get you to talk to Chandler.
94,Joey, All right. But if you weren’t my best friend.
97,Chandler," I walk into a room and he won’t even talk to me, he just mumbles
something in Italian. And I know he only knows the bad words."
98,Joey," (entering) Hey Gunther, have you uh, have you seen Chandler?"
102,Chandler, Hey Joe.
103,Joey, (Something in Italian.) (Storms out.)
106,Monica, Oh my God! How cute is the on-call doctor?
107,Rachel," Ooh, so cute, that I’m thinking about jamming this pen in my eye."
110,Monica," Oh no-no-no, not Dr. Burke. Dr. Burke is out of town. The-the on-call
doctor will see me now."
115,Chandler," Hey! I’m sorry! That—(sees that Joey is about to leave)
where are you going?"
116,Joey, My folks.
117,Chandler," Oh, uh, when-when are you coming back?"
118,Joey," I don’t know. I might stay there for a few days while I look for an
apartment."
119,Chandler, What?!
120,Joey," Yeah, y’know at first I thought we could talk about this y’know,
work it out, but uh, seeing you two together I don’t think I…"
121,Chandler," Hey, look, what do you want me to say? Do you want me to say that
I’ll stop seeing her?"
122,Joey," Look, it’s not about her. Okay? But seeing you two together just
reminds me of what you did. And I don’t want to live with some one who doesn’t
know what it is to be a friend. So, I’ll see ya. (He starts to leave, but Chandler
grabs his bag and stops him.)"
123,Chandler," Hey, look, I know what it is to be a friend, I just-I just screwed up!"
124,Joey, Yeah! You did! And that’s why I’m leaving.
126,Chandler," All right look, if you’re not gonna stay for me, then at least
stay for them! Okay, they have had a very difficult year! What with the
robbery and all!"
127,Joey," When that guy was robbing us, and I was locked in the entertainment unit
for like six hours, you know what I was doing in there all that time? I was thinking about
how I let you down! "
128,Chandler, What?
129,Joey," Yeah! But if would’ve know what kind of friend you were gonna turn
out to be, I wouldn’t have worried about it so much! See you around!"
130,Chandler," All right, wait! Come on! Just wait one second! There has to be
something that I can do! Something! If we still had that entertainment unit I would get in
it for six hours and think about how I let you down. (Joey looks intrigued) What?"
131,Joey, We’ve got a box. (Motions to a large wooden box next to him.)
135,Monica, I was probably waiting for it to open.
137,Monica, You look great too.
139,Monica, So how does it look?
141,Monica, Like a pirate?!
143,Monica," Umm, so how long have you been working with your dad? (He looks at her)
Come on, one of us had to mention him."
145,Monica, Oh. Big family dinner tonight?
147,Monica, No way!
149,Monica, (disappointed) Oh.
151,Monica, (happy) Oh. 
153,Monica," (sympathetic) Oh. (in a pirate’s voice) So you made her walk the
plank? Aye, matie?"
155,Monica, I know.
157,Ross, He’s coming here for Thanksgiving!
158,Rachel," I know, it’s sick."
159,Monica, Why is it sick?
160,Rachel," Because it’s Richard’s son! It’s like inviting Greek
tragedy over for dinner!"
161,Monica," Hey, come on, Phoebe, you understand don’t you?"
162,Phoebe," Yeah, I can see where I’d be your best shot but, no. I’m
sorry, but I think it’s twisted."
163,Ross, Yeah.
164,Joey, (coming out of the bathroom) What’s twisted?
165,Monica, Me going out with Richard’s son.
166,Joey, Ewwwww!! Ew! Ew! Ew!
167,Chandler," (He is now in the box, in their living room.) Sounds like a really bad
idea to me."
168,Rachel, Is he okay in there?
169,Joey, He’s fine!
170,Ross," Hey, y'know, Mon, if things wrong out between you and Richard’s son,
you’d be able to tell your kids, that you slept with their grandfather."
171,Monica," Fine! Judge all you want to but, (points to Ross) married a lesbian,
(points to Rachel) left a man at the altar, (points to Phoebe) fell in love with a gay ice
dancer, (points to Joey) threw a girl’s wooden leg in a fire, (points to Chandler)
livin’ in a box!! (goes to her room)"
172,Rachel," So now, what exactly is the point of the box?"
173,Joey, Chandler?
174,Chandler," The meaning of the box is three fold. One (holds a finger up through
the air hole), it gives me the time to think about what I did. Two (holds up another
finger), it proves how much I care about my friendship with Joey. And three (holds up a
third finger), it hurts!"
175,Ross," (to Rachel) Oh hey! Hey uh, you remember the necklace I gave you last
year? Can I see it?"
176,Rachel, (worried) Why?
177,Ross, I just wanna check something.
178,Rachel, Okay. (She goes into her bedroom)
179,Ross," (He puts his hand over the hole on the box.) (to Chandler) Now, we’ll
see."
180,Chandler, Air hole! Air hole!! (Ross retracts his hand quickly.)
181,Rachel," (coming out of her bedroom with a necklace) Here it is! I love it. I
wear it all the time."
182,Ross," (grabbing the necklace) The necklace I got you was gold, this one is
silver."
183,Rachel," Huh, well maybe it uh, it changed. "
184,Ross, Oh my God! You actually exchanged it!
185,Rachel," Well isn’t it better that I exchanged it for something that I enjoy
and that I can get a lot of use out of?"
186,Ross, What did you get?
187,Rachel, Credit. 
189,Monica," (running in from her bedroom) I’ll get it! I’ll get it!
I’ll get it! I’ll get it! I’ll get it! I’ll get it! I’ll get it!
I’ll get it! I’ll get it! I’ll get it! I’ll get it! I’ll get it!
I’ll get it! I’ll get it! (opens the door) Hi, Tim."
191,Monica," Thank you. Come meet my friends. This is uh, Phoebe. "
193,Monica, And Joey.
194,Joey, Hey!
196,Monica," My brother, Ross."
197,Ross, Hey.
198,Monica, And Rachel. (Chandler clears his voice loudly) And that’s Chandler.
199,Chandler, How do ya do.
201,Monica," Umm, well, he’s…"
202,Joey, He’s doin’ some thinkin’!
204,Chandler, What happened? What happened?!
205,Joey, You kissed my girlfriend!
207,Rachel," Ooh, I like those sunglasses."
208,Ross," Like ‘em, like ‘em? Or, I’d like to get store credit for
that amount like ‘em?"
209,Rachel," (Swears in Italian, it’s the same term used by Joey earlier and
Joey nods his approval.)"
210,Monica," All right everybody, this turkey is ready!"
212,Monica," Here, let me show you. Okay, the towels are hanging next to the sink,
and umm, you can use the fancy soap."
214,Rachel, Fancy soap? I thought we were savin’ that for the Pope!
215,Monica, See he’s nice. Right?
216,Phoebe," Yeah, but Monica, do you actually want to be in a relationship where you
can actually use the phrase, ""That’s not how your dad used to do it."""
218,Monica, I saved you a seat. (Motions to the one next to her.)
219,Rachel, (pouring the wine) Sick-sick-sick-sick.
221,Phoebe," Oh, I’ll get it. (goes over to the door.)"
222,Chandler, Gotcha! (laughs)
223,Joey, That doesn’t sound like thinking to me!
224,Chandler, Sorry!
225,Joey," Y’know I don’t think you should be talking at all in there! I
think you’ve got to much thinking to do to be talking and making jokes!"
226,Chandler," Okay, okay, you got it!"
227,Rachel," Ross, can you pass me the yams?"
228,Ross," Sure! Oh, and Joey’s got the mashed potatoes if you want to exchange
them."
229,Rachel, Would you stop?! What is the matter with you?!
230,Monica," Oh-ho-ho, we’ve got company."
231,Ross," There’s nothing the matter with me. See, I’m not completely
devoid of sentiment, see I have feelings."
232,Rachel," Okay, fine. (She gets up and walks into her bedroom)"
234,Chandler," You can’t tell, but I’m trying to break the tension by
mooning you guys!"
235,Joey," All right, look! If this is just a big joke to you, then forget about it,
all right?! This means something to me! And if it doesn’t mean anything to you, then
you should get out of there, otherwise you’re just an idiot in a box!"
236,Chandler," You’re right, and I’m sorry! This means a lot to me! I want
you to be my friend again! I swear, I won’t say another word tonight."
237,Joey, So are you gonna start taking this thing seriously?
238,Chandler, Absolutely!
239,Joey," That sounds like another word to me! Are you gonna take this seriously?
(There’s no response from Chandler.) Okay."
241,Rachel," Don’t say that I have no sentiment! (Starts to show Ross
what’s in the box.) This is a movie stub from our first date! This is an eggshell
from the first time you made me breakfast in bed! (Holds up a bone) This is from the
museum from the first time we… were together. Okay, maybe I exchange gifts sometimes,
but I keep the things that matter! "
242,Ross," I don’t know what to say, I’m sorry. Though, you’re not
supposed to take these. (Points to the bone) It’s like a million years old, we, we
actually, we had people looking for that."
245,Monica," (putting off her coat) Ooh, this always happens. (Her coat gets stuck.)"
247,Monica, Thank you.
249,Monica, Y’know all my friends think this is weird. 
251,Monica," I know! I mean it’s like me and your dad, that’s a totally
separate thing."
253,Monica, We’re just two people who find each other very attractive. Right?
256,Monica, Nothing. Nothing.
258,Monica," No-no-no that was good, it was, that was uh, that was a goood kiss…"
260,Monica, (interrupting) Don’t say it!
262,Monica, Yeah!
264,Monica, I know!
267,Joey, I’ll get it. (It’s Kathy.)
269,Joey, Hey.
271,Joey, That’s okay. Chandler’s the one I’m mad at.
273,Joey, In the box.
275,Phoebe," Oh, he-he can’t talk right now."
277,Phoebe, He’s just trying to show Joey how much he means to him.
279,Rachel," Joey, had reasons. "
280,Phoebe, They were threefold.
283,Joey, (starting to cry) Open the box!! (Runs over to do so.)
284,Rachel, What?!
285,Joey," He can still catch her! Come on, get out of there! (He opens the box) Get
out of there!"
286,Chandler, So?
287,Joey," Yeah, we’re gonna be fine! Get out!"
288,Chandler, Yeah?
289,Joey," Yeah, you did some real good thinkin’ in there."
290,Chandler," Man, this is… "
292,Joey," Now go! ‘Cause you can still catch her! And Merry Christmas from
you’re secret Santa! (Chandler runs out and closes the door.) "
294,Joey," All right, who got Chandler? ‘Cause I uh, need to trade."
297,Rachel," Oh, he sees her!"
298,Monica," Oh, he’s catching up to her!"
299,Phoebe," Oh, she sees him! Oh, they’re hugging!"
300,Ross, He’s taking her purse!
301,Joey," Uhh, that’s not them. I’m gonna go call the police."
302,Phoebe," Oh, there they are!"
304,Phoebe," All right, get a room."
0,Phoebe, Okay!
1,Monica," Come on, no peeking! (They are leading the gang out with there hands
over their eyes.)"
2,Chandler," Our eyes are closed and we’re about to cross the street. Very
good."
3,Phoebe," Okayyyyy, open up! "
5,Ross," What did you want to show us? Because all I can see is this bitchin'
van!"
6,Phoebe," Yeah, it’s for our catering business!"
7,Joey, I think I know that girl.
8,Monica," All right, umm, we’re not gonna really keep it this way though."
9,Rachel, No?
10,Phoebe," No, we’re gonna paint over the sword, and replace it with a
baguette. "
11,Rachel, Oh!
12,Phoebe," And also, we don’t know what to do with this. (She turns on a
switch and the girl’s nipples light up.)"
13,Joey," Oh yeah, I definitely know her."
16,Monica," (to Phoebe) Remember that guy from cooking school I told you about that
put cilantro with everything?"
17,Phoebe," Oh sure, Cilantro Larry."
18,Monica," Well, I’m gonna fill in for him as food critic for the Chelsea
Reporter."
19,Monica," Wow, Monica! What an amazing opportunity to influence… dozens of
people."
20,Phoebe," How could you say yes, what about our catering business?"
21,Monica," Oh no-no-no, it’s only one night a week, and plus I get to take all
of you out for a lot of free dinners."
23,Phoebe," Oh, in that case—(hops up and down in joy)—Yay! (Monica looks
confused) That was me hopping on board."
24,Monica, Oh.
25,Chandler," (entering) Hey, you guys! Hey, Ross, quick question for ya. Are you
ready to party?"
26,Ross," I don’t know, I could maybe go out for a couple of beers, but
there’s this thing about bumblebees on The Discovery Channel that I was
planning to watch."
27,Chandler," No-no, I don’t think you heard me. Are you ready to party?!"
28,Ross, Nooo!! Gandolf?! Gandolf is coming to town?
29,Chandler," Kathy’s with her parents, I have nothing to do, so tomorrow we
are partying with Gandolf dude!"
30,Ross," Dude, we are sooo gonna party!"
31,Phoebe," Wow! Okay, dude alert! And who is this guy?"
32,Ross," Mike ""Gandolf"" Ganderson, only like the funest guy in the world."
33,Chandler, I’m gonna call and get off work tomorrow!
34,Ross, I’m gonna call after you!
35,Chandler," This is gonna be soo cool, dude, we never party anymore!"
37,Monica," All right, were you guys smoking something in the back of our van?"
38,Joey," Really. And what do you mean you never have fun anymore? You have fun with
me, remember that time we saw those strippers and you paid me 50 bucks to eat that book?"
39,Ross," Joey, you are gonna love this guy. Gandolf is like the party wizard!"
40,Joey," Well, why do you call him Gandolf?"
41,Ross," Gandolf the wizard. (Joey is still confused) Hello! Didn’t you read Lord
of the Rings in high school?"
42,Joey," No, I had sex in high school."
44,Rachel," Oh, uh, Joanna I was wondering if I could ask you something.
There’s an opening for an assistant buyer in Junior Miss…"
46,Rachel," Well, actually, I meant for me. The hiring committee is meeting people
all day and…"
48,Rachel," God, I am so glad you don’t have a problem with this, because if
you did, I wouldn’t even consider applying."
50,Rachel," (interrupting) And that’s I’m so glad… there’s no
problem."
52,Rachel, Ohh! That’s great!
54,Rachel, Really?!
56,Rachel," Well, I, umm…"
59,Chandler, Oh man! I am so excited—I may vomit!
60,Joey," Will you calm down, he’s just a human guy."
61,Chandler," Look you don’t understand, Gandolf is amazing. Y’know
you’re never know what’s gonna end up happening, you go out for a couple of
beers and end up on a fishing boat to Nova Scotia! "
62,Joey, Really?!
63,Chandler," Oh yeah, it’s beautiful country up there."
64,Ross," (entering) Hey! Okay! I got my passport, fresh socks, and a snake bite
kit!"
65,Chandler, It’s not gonna be exactly like last time.
66,Joey," All right, I’ll see you guys."
68,Chandler, Whoa-wh-wh-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa!
69,Joey," I have an audition, but I’ll definitely hook up with you later. Where
are you gonna be around noon?"
70,Ross, Somewhere maybe along the equator?
71,Joey, Okay. (leaves as the phone rings)
72,Chandler," (answering it) Hello. (listens) (to Ross) It’s Gandolf!!! (on
phone) So, are you in town? (listens) (disappointed) Oh, well, well maybe next time then.
(Hangs up)"
73,Ross, What happened?
74,Chandler," He’s not gonna make it, he’s stuck in Chicago."
75,Ross," Ohh, man! Chicago, is sooo lucky!"
76,Chandler," Stupid, useless Canadian money!"
79,Rachel, Thank you.
81,Rachel," Well, they uh, they-they do more than that."
83,Rachel," Yes, Joanna really has been an incredible mentor to me."
85,Rachel," I-I-I of course, I have more responsibilities than that."
88,Rachel," Yes, I realize that…"
90,Rachel, I love working with designers!
93,Monica, Hey! My first review is out!
94,Phoebe," Ohh! Oh, the Chelsea Reporter, ohh, this used to keep me so warm."
95,Monica," All right, look at my on the back page."
96,Phoebe," Oh, okay! (reading) ""Would I go back to Allesandro’s? Sure,
but I’d have to order two meals, one for me and one for the guy pointing the gun to
my head."" (to Monica) Wow! You really laid into this place."
97,Monica," Hey, they don’t pay me a penny a word to make friends."
98,Phoebe," Ooh, I gotta go. I found a guy that who could fix up the van for
catering."
99,Monica, Oh! Do you need me to go with you?
100,Phoebe," No-no, it’s okay. But are we sure we don’t want the waterbed?"
101,Monica, Haven’t we made this decision?
102,Phoebe," Yeah, all right. (starts to leave)"
103,Monica, Bye!
104,Phoebe, Bye!
106,Monica, (answering it) Who is it?
108,Monica, Oh my God.
110,Monica," Oh my God, oh my God. (on intercom) Call me on the phone!"
112,Monica," Look, I-I’m never gonna let you up so you may as well just go away."
114,Phoebe," (on intercom) Hey, do you need to get in? Here you go."
115,Monica, No! Phoebe!
116,Phoebe," Hey, Monica!"
120,Monica," I couldn’t eat it! I had five friends who couldn’t eat it, and
one of them eats books."
122,Monica, The waiter carried the breadsticks in his pants!
124,Monica," All right, that I’ll retract. But I stand by my review, I know food
and that wasn’t it. You’re marinara sauce tasted like tomato juice! You should
serve it with vodka and a piece of celery. "
126,Monica," Oh my God! You own an Italian restaurant and you think that tastes
good?! Where are you even from?"
128,Monica," Hand me those tomatoes, I’m gonna show you what it should taste
like! Come on, hand me them."
131,Rachel," (entering Joanna’s office) Umm, Joanna? I wanna talk about that
interview."
133,Rachel," No! It didn’t! That’s what I want to talk to you about.
(starts to break up) Now, just to brief you… (starts to cry) I may cry, but they are
not tears of sadness or of anger, but just of me having this discussion with you."
135,Rachel, There’s nobody here!
139,Rachel, Do you want me to quit?
141,Rachel," Well of those things that you said in the interview, I mean if you
believe any of them, I must not be a very good assistant. Y’know what? I
am just gonna pack up my desk, (She goes over to get all of her belongings from the desk,
which amount to a muffin and a pen) and I will be gone by the end of the day! (Realizes
she has nothing.) Well, I guess there’s no use to me sticking around ‘til the
end of the day! (Starts to leave.)"
143,Rachel, What?
145,Rachel, My drinking? 
147,Rachel, Said what? Exactly.
149,Rachel," Oh my God!! Ohh, that is it! I’m leaving! You are just a horrible
person!"
151,Rachel, Say more things like that.
153,Rachel, I’d need an expense account.
155,Rachel, And an assistant.
158,Joey," Hey! What are you guys doing here? I thought you’d be out partying
with Gandel-worf."
159,Ross," It’s Gandolf, and he’s not coming."
160,Joey, So you’ve been sittin’ around here all mornin’?
161,Ross, No! I balanced my checkbook. 
162,Chandler," Yeah, and I-I gave first names to all of the foosball players."
163,Ross, I can’t believe he didn’t come!
164,Joey, So what if he didn’t come! We can still go out and party ourselves!
165,Chandler," Oh-no, y’know with Gandolf we’d be out all
night!"
166,Ross," Yeah! We’d meet, we’d meet total strangers, and hang out with
them!"
167,Joey," Well, we could do that! "
168,Ross, There’s other stuff too.
169,Joey," We’ll do it all, and better! Look, after tonight, Gandolf will want
to party with us, dude! Come on!"
170,Ross, Yeah!
171,Joey, Yeah!
172,Ross, Yeah!!
173,Joey, Yeah!! 
174,Ross, It’s not like we don’t know how to party!!
175,Joey, Yeah! All right? Let’s go!
176,Chandler, And may-maybe we could end up on a boat again?
178,Chandler, All right!!
179,Ross," (to Chandler) Hey-hey-hey, when uh, when were we on a boat?"
180,Chandler," Remember that really cold morning, you woke up and those dogs were
licking your face?"
181,Ross, Yeah.
182,Chandler," Well, those were seals, man."
184,Rachel," Hey Mon, little question for ya! How do you think this suit will look on
an assistant buyer?"
185,Monica," Okay, the owner of Allesandro’s came over to yell at me, but
instead I made him some sauce, and he offered me the job as head chef!!"
186,Rachel," Oh my God!! You just ruined the thing I was practicing the whole way
home, but I’m soo happy!"
187,Monica, Can you believe it? I finally get to run my own kitchen!
188,Rachel," Ohh, you’ve waited soo long. "
189,Phoebe, (entering) Hey!
190,Rachel," Hey, Pheebs, quick question for ya."
191,Phoebe, Yeah.
192,Rachel, How do you think this suit would look on an assistant buyer at Bloomingdale’s?
193,Phoebe," I don’t know, it would totally depend on her coloring and…
(realizes) You got the job!!"
194,Rachel, Yes!!!
195,Monica, You got the job?! Why didn’t you tell me?
196,Rachel," Ohh, it’s gonna be so great! I’m gonna get to help decide what
we sell, I’m gonna have an office with walls and everything. (turns to Monica)
I’m gonna have walls!"
197,Phoebe," Okay, is this the day of good news or what? I got us a job! The wedding
reception."
198,Monica," Ohh! Umm, Phoebe, I kinda need to talk to you about that. (Rachel
excuses herself) Umm, well I-I-I think it might be time for me to take a step back from
catering."
199,Phoebe, But we’ve only had one job.
200,Monica," I know, but now we have this second one and it just, it feels like
it’s snowballing, y’know?"
201,Phoebe, Yeah! What are you saying?
202,Monica, I got offered the head chef job at Allesandro’s.
203,Phoebe, What?
204,Monica," It’s okay, ‘cause y'know what? You don’t really need me
for the business."
205,Phoebe," You’re the cook! With out you it’s just me driving up to
people’s houses with empty trays and asking for money!"
206,Monica," All right. But umm, I-I-I’ll pay you back all the money you
invested, and you can keep the van."
207,Phoebe, For what? I can’t believe this! I gotta get out of here. (leaves) 
208,Monica," Phoebe, wait a minute! (runs after her, leaving Rachel alone)"
209,Rachel, I’m an assistant buyer!!
211,Joey," All right, so we’ll get a little coffee, and get energized, and
we’ll head back out."
212,Chandler," Yeah, all right."
213,Ross, Okay.
214,Joey," So, we’re having fun, right?"
216,Joey," We don’t need that wizard guy. We hit a couple of clubs, talked to
some strangers, and uh, after this, we’ll head down to the docks and see about that
boat thing."
217,Ross, I’m kinda beat.
218,Chandler," Actually, me too."
219,Joey, Are you serious?!
221,Joey, Thank God! I’m exhausted!
223,Joey," Yeah, but uh, I don’t want to be up too late, so uh, I’ll have a
decaf. "
224,Ross," Yeah, me too."
225,Chandler," Actually, can I get some hot water with a little lemon? I think I
strained my voice screaming in there. Does it have to be so loud?"
226,Joey," I can’t hear a word you’re saying, my ears are ringing so bad."
227,Ross," I’m just glad I brought that extra pair of socks, y’know? I used
them as mittens, I didn’t want to touch a thing in that last place."
229,Ross, How sad are we?
230,Joey," Yeah, I know."
231,Chandler," Y’know what? We’re not sad, we’re not sad, we’re
just not 21 anymore. Y’know? I’m 29 years old, damnit! And I want to sit in a
comfortable chair, and watch television and go to bed at a reasonable hour!"
233,Joey," Yeah! And I like to hang out in a quiet place where I can talk to my
friends."
235,Ross," And so what if I like to go home, throw on some Kenny G, and take a bath!"
236,Joey," We’re 29, we’re not women."
238,Monica," (entering) Ohh, here you are. Y’know, I’m-I’m glad you
decided to hear me out."
239,Phoebe," Okay, I’m hearing."
240,Monica," I’ve been doing a lot of thinking. A lot! And umm, well, I came up
with a whole bunch of businesses you can do with your van. Okay umm, you could be flower
delivery person."
241,Phoebe, What?!
242,Monica, Or! A bakery delivery person.
243,Phoebe, I wa-I wa-I wa…
244,Monica, Pizza?!
245,Phoebe, Monica! 
246,Monica," All right, I’ve got a whole bunch of uh-uh, stuff in this area, but
umm, I’m getting the feeling that you don’t want to deliver."
247,Phoebe, No.
248,Monica," Okay. I’m guessing that if you don’t want to deliver, you
probably don’t want to pick stuff up either."
249,Phoebe, No.
250,Monica," Y’know what, let’s do the catering business."
251,Phoebe, Really?! Are you sure?
252,Monica," Yeah, y'know I-I made a commitment to you. Y’know what, it’d
be, it’d be fun."
253,Phoebe," Oh! It will be fun! Ohh! Yay! Oh! Okay, ooh, let’s
plan the wedding reception. (She grabs the notebook which Monica used for her ideas and
starts flipping page after page after page after page after page to find a blank one.)
Wow! You really wanted me to do something with this van. (pause)
Y’know what, I want you to take the chef job."
254,Monica, Really?!
255,Phoebe," Yeah. That’s what you really want. Yeah, I don’t want to be
the reason you’re unhappy, that would just make me unhappy, and I really
don’t want to be the reason I’m unhappy."
256,Monica, Thank you.
257,Phoebe," Besides, it might be kinda fun to form the new A-Team."
259,Rachel," Oh, hi Mrs. Lynch! Is Joanna in already?"
261,Rachel, Heard what?
263,Rachel, Oh my God! How?!
265,Rachel," Oh my God! Oh, I cannot believe it!"
267,Rachel," Oh, God. Oh, God. (gets worried) Oh God."
269,Rachel," Yes, so close. Mrs. Lynch, I know that this is an
emotional and difficult time, for all of us. But by any chance did Joanna send any
paperwork your way before… it happened."
271,Rachel," Yes-yes, just a few seconds and she’d still be with us—nothing
about an assistant buyer?"
274,Rachel," Oh, Sophie, I guess you didn’t hear about Joanna…"
279,Monica,"  Umm, I just wanna say, uh (reads from a 3 X 5 card) that with a
pinch of exictement, a dash of hard work, a dollup of cooperation, we can have the
recipe... (Looks up and sees eveyone glaring at her) Are you gonna kill me?"
0,Ross, Hey! 
2,Ross," I’m sorry I’m late, did I miss anything?"
3,Phoebe," Joey stuffing 15 Oreos in his mouth. (Joey, with an obvious
mouth full, nods yes.)"
4,Ross," 15? (Joey nods again) Your personal best! (Ross takes an Oreo and
Joey mumbles, no!)"
5,Phoebe, Where were you?
6,Ross," Oh, on a date. Yeah, I met this girl on the train going to a museum
upstate."
8,Chandler," Oh, yeah! How did you meet her?"
9,Phoebe," Oh, which museum?"
10,Phoebe," (just Phoebe) No, answer his."
11,Ross," Okay, it was just me and her at the back of the train, and I sat near the
door, so she’d have to pass by me if she wanted to switch cars. She was totally at my
mercy."
12,Chandler, Were you so late because you were burring this woman?
13,Ross," No, I’m getting back down ‘cause she lives in Poughkeepsie. She
seems really great, but she’s like totally great, but she lives two and a half hours
away."
14,Chandler," How can she be great if she’s from Poughkeepsie? (laughs, at they
all look at him) That joke would’ve killed in Albany."
15,Joey," Done! I did it! Heh, who’s stupid now? (He smiles and has cookie
remains all over his teeth.)"
18,Chandler," Hey, look at this! (Holding a newspaper) They’re lighting the big
Christmas tree tonight."
19,Phoebe," Umm, that paper’s two weeks old. "
20,Chandler," All right, who keeps leaving old newspapers in the trash?! I really
wanted to take Kathy to this, I can’t believe I missed it."
21,Rachel," Hey, y’know, at least you have somebody to miss that stuff with! I hate
being alone this time of year! Next thing you know it’ll be Valentine’s Day,
then my birthday, then bang!—before you know it, they’re lighting that damn tree
again. Ohh, I want somebody! (hearing this, Gunther moves in)
Y’know, I want a man!! (Gunther leaves depressed) I mean, it
doesn’t even have to be a big relationship, y’know, just like a fling would be
great."
22,Chandler, Really?! I didn’t think girls ever just wanted a fling.
23,Rachel," Well, believe me, it’s been a long time since I’ve been flung."
24,Joey," Well, I know what I’m giving you for Christmas."
25,Chandler," Y’know what? There’s some nice guys at my office, do you
want me to set you up?"
26,Rachel," Yeah! Wait a minute, it’s been a long time that I’ve been
single. How come you never offered this before?"
27,Chandler," Well, I have a girlfriend, I’m-I’m happy. So, I no longer
feel the need to go out of my way to stop others from being happy."
28,Rachel," Okay! No accountants. Oh, and no one from like legal. I don’t like
guys with boring jobs."
29,Chandler, Oh and Ross was like what? A lion tamer?
32,Phoebe, What’s wrong Mon?
33,Monica," Ohh, everybody at the restaurant still hates me."
34,Phoebe, Oh.
35,Monica," I thought I was making headway, everyone was smiling at me all day, I
get off work and I find out that they wrote this (puts on her chef hat) on my chef’s
hat. (The hat says ‘Quit, bitch’)"
36,Phoebe," Hey, maybe they meant to write, ‘Quiet, bitch.’"
37,Rachel," Hey, honey! What’s the matter? (Monica shows her, her hat.) Fine, I
was just trying to be nice! Whoa!"
38,Monica," I mean I have not been picked on this much since kindergarten and they
had to bring in someone from junior high to do the see-saw with me. (Joey laughs and
Monica glares at him.)"
39,Joey, Ohhh!
40,Monica," I mean they’re trying to do everything they can to make me quit,
and if there were any other job, I would. But this is something I’ve been waiting for
my whole life."
41,Rachel," Well, wait a minute, you’re the boss! Why don’t you just yell
at them? Or, fire them?"
42,Monica," I would love too, but I can’t! I mean I just can’t, you know
that I’m not good at confrontation."
43,Chandler," Hey, you know what you can do? I remember reading about this director,
I think it was Orson Wells, who at the beginning of the movie would hire somebody, just so
he could fire them in front of everybody. Then they would all know, who’s boss."
44,Joey," Hey, Mon! I’m not doing anything, why don’t you fire me?"
45,Monica," That’s a good idea! Wait, do you know how to waiter?"
46,Joey, Good enough to get fired.
47,Monica," All right, you’re hired!"
48,Joey," Hey! That must be why I got fired last week! Does this Orson Wells guy
direct Burger King commercials?"
49,Chandler, (he glares at him for a while) Yes.
51,Chandler," I say, Drew! Are you seeing anybody right now? (Drew looks at him)
Og-ee-op, I’m not asking for me, I’m… I mean… No, I’m-I’m
not gay, I’m not asking you out. I’m not-I’m not-I’m not gay!"
53,Chandler," See my friend-my friend, Rachel, she wants to be set up."
55,Chandler," Oh, y’know what, that might be okay even if it was just kind of a
fling, that might be all right with Rachel."
57,Chandler," (to Drew) Oh, by the way, that is her full name."
62,Chandler," Oh well, that’s uh, a little later than I uh, generally care to
stay, but sure!"
64,Chandler," Well, I don’t really know what that is, but let’s!!"
66,Phoebe," Hey! You guys, I’m writing a holiday song for everyone. Do you want
to hear it?"
68,Phoebe," (singing) Happy Chanukah, Monica! May your Christmas be snowy, Joey!
Happy New Year, Chandler and Ross. Spin the draddle, Rachel!"
69,Rachel," Pheebs, that’s great!"
70,Phoebe," Oh, yay!"
71,Rachel," But y’know umm, Rachel doesn’t rhyme with draddle."
72,Phoebe, I know but it’s so hard! Nothing rhymes with your stupid name!
73,Joey," What are you talking about? Lots of things rhyme with Rachel. Bagel. Mail.
Jail. Bail. Able. May-pole."
74,Phoebe," All good, thanks. (to Rachel) Do you maybe have a nickname have like a
nickname that’s easier to rhyme?"
75,Monica, Didn’t your dad used to call you Pumpkin?
76,Rachel, Oh yeah!
77,Phoebe," Pumpkin? Yeah. But did he ever call you like, Budolph?"
78,Chandler," (entering) Hello, children!"
80,Chandler, (to Rachel) Have I got the 50 guys for you!
81,Rachel, Really?!
82,Chandler," Oh yeah, I just showed this a picture of you and guys were throwing
themselves at me! They’re buying me drinks! They’re giving me stuff! (to Joey)
Knicks tonight?"
83,Joey, Sure! Where are the seats?
84,Chandler, Wherever! I’ve got like 20!
85,Rachel," So, will I like any of these guys?"
86,Chandler," Y’know what, I’m gonna uh, play the field just a little
more."
87,Rachel, Chandler!
88,Chandler, Guys are signing over their 401-K’s to me?
89,Phoebe, (shocked) You work with robots!!
90,Chandler," (pause) Yes. (to Rachel) Okay, there’s this one guy, Patrick, I
think you’re gonna like him, he’s really nice, he’s funny, he’s a
swimmer."
91,Rachel," Ohh, I like swimmer’s bodies!"
92,Chandler," Yes, and his father invented that magnetic strip on the back of credit
cards."
93,Rachel," Op, I like credit cards!"
94,Chandler," See, I’m not bad at this fixing up thing, huh?"
95,Rachel," Well, so what does he do?"
96,Chandler," Oh, he works in the Fine Foods division."
97,Rachel, Your company has a fine foods division?
98,Chandler," It’s a big company, I don’t—if you—I…"
99,Joey," Now, wait a second! You make food and robots?"
100,Phoebe," No! No, the robots just work for them."
101,Monica," (getting up) All right, I’m gonna go to work. Does anybody have a
problem with that?"
102,Joey," Yeah, lady, I do! I got a problem with that!"
103,Monica, You want a problem? I’ll give you a problem!
104,Joey," Oh, what are you gonna do? You’re gonna fire me?"
105,Monica," You bet your ass, I’m gonna fire you! Thank you. "
107,Ross," Oh, wow! I should get going. I-I got a date tonight."
108,Chandler, Oh yeah! With who?
109,Ross, You know that girl I told you about who lives up in Poughkeepsie?
110,Chandler, Yeah.
111,Ross," Not her. Yeah, this is someone else I meet, and I-I can’t decide
between the two of them. Y’know the one from Poughkeepsie, even though she’s a
two hour train ride away, is really pretty, really smart, and-and a lot of fun. But this
other girl, well, she lives right uptown. Y’know she’s, well
she’s-she’s just as pretty, I guess she’s smart, she’s not
fun."
112,Phoebe," If she’s no fun, why do you want to date her at all?"
113,Ross," Well, I-I want to give her another chance, y’know? She lives so
close. And, at the end of the date, the other time, she-she said something that
was—if she was kidding was very funny. On the other hand, if she wasn’t kidding,
she’s not fun, she’s stupid, and kind of a racist."
114,Joey, (entering) Hey!
115,Ross, Hey!
116,Chandler," Hey, man!"
117,Phoebe," Hey! Ooh, how was your first day working at the restaurant?"
118,Joey, (checks his watch) Damn! (runs out to work)
120,Joey, (entering from the dining room) Hey.
121,Monica, Hey.
122,Joey," Hey, what happened to your fancy chef’s jacket? (sees there’s a
burn spot on it)"
123,Monica," They baked it. I can’t take this anymore. I’m gonna call a
meeting tonight, I’m gonna fire you tonight."
124,Joey," You got it! Oh-oh! (He starts patting the burned spot, which just happens
to be over her breast.)"
125,Monica, What are you doing?!
126,Joey, It’s still a tiny bit on fire there.
127,Monica, Thanks. (Joey’s still patting the burn spot) I think you got it!
129,Rachel, (entering) Chandler!! You have the best taste in men!
130,Chandler," Well, like father, like son."
131,Rachel," Patrick and I had such a great time last night! I mean I think this
could maybe turn into something serious."
132,Chandler," Really?! I-I thought you weren’t looking for something serious? I
thought you were looking for some kind of a fling."
133,Rachel," Well, y'know, possibly. (pause) You didn’t tell him that, though?
Right?"
134,Chandler," Ummmmmmmm, no."
135,Rachel," You told this guy that I was looking for a fling?! You don’t tell
the guy that!"
136,Chandler," Why not?! I’d be thrilled if I heard that some hot girl was just
looking to get—oh I see."
137,Rachel," Oh, between you telling him that I wanted to have a fling and me putting
out on the first date—oh, he’s so gonna get the wrong idea."
139,Monica," Hey, Joey, could you pass the cheese?"
140,Joey," Yeah. Listen uh, I’d prefer it if you didn’t call me Joey. Since
I don’t know anyone here, I thought it’d be cool to try out a cool work
nickname."
142,Joey," (opening an envelope) There’s like-there’s like 300 bucks in
this one!"
144,Monica," Okay. Could the waiters gather around to hear tonight’s specials?
Okay, first there is a Chilean Sea Bass prepared with a Mango relish on a bag—Why is
nobody writing these down?"
146,Monica," Because your all gonna make up fake specials and make me cook them like
you did the other night?"
148,Monica," Okay, forget the specials for a minute. Umm, all right here’s the
thing, for the last two weeks I have umm, (quietly) tried really hard to create a positive
atmosphere…"
150,Monica," (louder) A positive atmosphere! But I-I-I have had it up to here. (She
holds her hand over her head as an afterthought.) From now on, it is gonna be my
way, or the highway! All right? Does anybody have a problem with that?!! (Joey looks at
the money he’s holding, and doesn’t speak up.) Hey new guy! I said, does anybody
have a problem with that?!"
151,Joey, No ma’am.
155,Monica, What the hell happened?!
156,Joey," I am so-so-so sorry. I was gonna do it! Really! But I was standing there
with 327 dollars in one hand and 238 dollars in the other hand, and I was thinking,
""Wow! It’s been a long time since I had… (tries to do the math in his head,
but can’t) 327 + 238 dollars!"""
157,Monica," Joey, we had a deal. That-that’s why you’re here! I’ve
got to fire you!"
158,Joey," And I gotta pay rent! Look, how-how about this? You don’t fire me,
instead I stay here, I gain their trust, and they’ll start listening to all the nice
things I’ve been saying about you."
159,Monica, What kinda things have you been saying?
160,Joey," Well nothing yet, they really hate you and I want to fit in."
162,Phoebe," (singing) Happy, happy Chanukah, Chandler and Monica. Very merry…"
163,Chandler," (interrupting) Oh, y’know, y’know what Pheebs?"
164,Phoebe, What?
165,Chandler," I’m not Jewish, so…"
166,Phoebe," So! Ross doesn’t really decorate his tree with
floss, but you don’t hear him complaining do you? God! (Phoebe hits her guitar which
wakes up Ross with a start.)"
167,Chandler, Bad dream?
168,Ross, I wasn’t sleeping.
169,Chandler," Oh yeah, then uh, what was Phoebe’s song about?"
170,Ross," The one with the cat. I gotta go, I’ve got another date."
171,Phoebe," So, did you pick one yet?"
172,Ross," No, it turns out that the one from uptown was making a joke. But it was a
different joke than I thought—it wasn’t that funny. So I’m still torn."
173,Phoebe," Well look, you don’t really like the one from uptown and
you’re too exhausted from dating the one up in Poughkeepsie, so I say you just end
them both. Okay? You take a train up to Poughkeepsie and break up with her, and on your
way back you break up with uptown. And then by the time you get home tonight, you’re
done!"
174,Ross," Y’know, you’re right. Thank you."
175,Phoebe," Umm, well I had a similar problem when I lived in Prague."
176,Chandler, Prague?
177,Phoebe, There’s sooo much you don’t know.
179,Rachel," Chandler! Patrick just uh, ended things with me. Did you or did you not
tell him that I was looking for a serious relationship?"
180,Chandler, I did! I absolutely did!
181,Rachel, You idiot!!
182,Chandler," I’m sure you’re right, but why?"
183,Rachel," You don’t tell a guy that you’re looking for a serious
relationship! You don’t tell the guy that! Now you scared him away!"
184,Chandler," Oh, man. I’m sorry, I’m so-so sorry."
185,Rachel," Y’know, you should never be allowed to talk to
people!"
186,Chandler, I know! I know!
187,Rachel," Oh! See just I’m right back where I started! Aww, this sucks! Being
alone, sucks! (She sits down heavily in one of the new chairs)"
188,Chandler," Well, y’know, you’re-you’re gonna meet somebody!
You’re a great catch! Y’know when I was telling all those guys about you, I
didn’t have to lie once. (He sits down on the arm of her chair)"
189,Rachel, Really?
190,Chandler," Yeah! You graduated Magma Ku Laude, right?"
191,Rachel, No.
192,Chandler," Oh, it doesn’t matter. (Kisses her on the top of her head.) Hey,
y’know what, I’ve got two tickets to tonight’s Rangers game, you wanna come
with me?"
193,Rachel, Cute guys in little shorts? Sure.
194,Chandler," Well, actually it’s a hockey team, so it’s angry Canadians
with no teeth."
195,Rachel, Well that sounds fun too. (They hug.)
197,Chandler, Have you ever been with a woman?
198,Rachel," What?! Chandler, what is the matter with you?!"
199,Chandler, So there is no good time to ask that question.
204,Monica," I need more swordfish. (to one of the assistant chefs) Can you get me
some more swordfish?"
206,Monica, You did a minute ago!
208,Monica, Fine!
210,Monica," Okay! Very funny! Somebody let me out please?! Come on, I’m cold!
(She spills something.) And covered in marinara sauce! Come on! Let me out! (the door
opens)"
212,Monica, That’s not funny.
214,Monica," (starting to cry) I’m a good person. And I’m a good chef, and
I don’t deserve to have marinara sauce all over me! Y’know what, if you want me
to quit this bad, then all you have to do is…"
215,Joey," (interrupting) Hey! Chef Geller! Y’know that little speech you made
the other day? Well I got a problem with it!"
216,Monica, You do?
217,Joey," You bet I do! I just ah, wasn’t listening then, that’s all."
218,Monica, Well if you want a problem? I’ll give you a problem!
219,Joey, What are you gonna do? You’re gonna fire me?
220,Monica," You bet your ass I’m gonna fire you! Get out of my kitchen! Get
out!! (Joey leaves) All right! Anybody else got a problem? How ‘bout you Chuckles?
You think this is funny now?"
222,Monica," How about if I dance around all covered in sauce? Huh?
You think it’s funny now? "
224,Monica," Good! Now, take those salads to table 4, (to the kitchen worker from
earlier) And you! Get the swordfish! (to another assistant chef) And you! Get a haircut!"
227,Ross," (waking up) What? (notices that there is now a beautiful woman sitting
next to him)"
229,Ross, What?
231,Ross, (now fully awake) Are we really in Montreal?!
233,Ross," Coffee sounds great. (They get up) Wait, so, so you live in Montreal?"
236,Joey," Well I guess I should’ve thought about my wife and kids before I
talked back to chef Geller!"
237,Monica, Thanks.
238,Joey," Yep! Looks like it’s gonna be a leeeeean Christmas at the Dragon
house this year."
239,Monica, Enough!
240,Joey, (leaving) Lean-lean-lean!
243,Phoebe," (singing) ""Went to the store, sat on Santa's lap.
                               
Asked him to bring my friends all kind of crap.
                               
Said all you need is to write them a song.
                               
They haven't heard it, so don't try and sing along.
                               
No, don't sing along."
0,Phoebe, Oh my God! I can’t believe my little brother is married!
2,Phoebe," You guys, why didn’t you tell me you were eloping?"
4,Phoebe," Wait, wait, why were you at the courthouse? "
6,Phoebe," Wow, a year and a half ago I didn’t even know I had a brother, and
now I have a sister too. (They all hug, and Frank and Alice start kissing.) Okay. Okay.
Stop it, don’t. So, I gotta get you a gift now. Is there anything you need?"
12,Phoebe," (shocked) That’s a really nice gift. I was thinking of like a gravy
boat."
15,Joey," (entering with Ross) Hey! You guys! Check it out, check it out! (He’s
wearing a blue blazer) Guess which job I got."
16,Chandler," I don’t know, but Donald Trump wants his blue blazer black."
18,Ross, What?
19,Chandler, Blue blazer back. He-he wants it back.
20,Rachel, But you-you said black. Why would he want his blue blazer black?
21,Chandler," Well, you-you know what I meant."
22,Monica," No, you messed it up. You’re stupid."
23,Chandler, So what job did you get Joe?
24,Joey," Oh, ah, tour guide at the museum. Yeah, Ross got it for me."
25,Rachel," Well, how can you be a tour guide, don’t you have to be a dinosaur
expert or something?"
26,Joey," No, not really. They give you all the information, it’s uh, it’s
like memorizing a script. (Making like a tour guide) ""And on your left, you have
Tyrannosaurus Rex, a carnivore from the Jurassic period."
28,Ross," Uh actually Joey, it’s the Cretasous period."
29,Joey," Yeah but, I can pronounce Jurassic."
30,Phoebe, (entering) Hey!!
32,Phoebe," Guess what. Frank Jr., and Alice got married!"
34,Phoebe," And! And, they’re gonna have a baby! (The gang is shocked.) And!
And, they want me to grow it for them in my uterus. (The gang is stunned into silence.)"
35,Ross, My God!
36,Monica, Are you serious?
37,Phoebe, Yeah
38,Joey, You’re really thinking about having sex with your brother?!
39,Phoebe," Ewww! And ""Oh no!"" It’s—they just want me to be the
surrogate. It’s her-it’s her egg and her sperm, and I’m-I’m just the
oven, it’s totally their bun. "
40,Joey, Huh.
41,Monica, What did you tell them?
42,Phoebe," Well, they said that I had to think about it first, but what is there to
think about? I’m gonna be giving them the greatest gift you can possibly give."
43,Chandler," You’re gonna be carrying their baby and give them a Sony Play
Station?"
44,Rachel," Honey, this really is an incredible thing to do for them, but there are
things to think about."
45,Monica," Yeah, like you’re gonna be pregnant. I mean pregnant."
46,Phoebe, I know!
47,Ross," Pheebs, you’re talking about putting your body through an awful lot,
I mean morning sickness, uhh, labour, and it’s all for somebody else!"
48,Phoebe," Yeah, what’s your point?"
49,Ross," Well, the stuff I just mentioned."
50,Rachel," Wow! I don’t know if I could ever do that. I always figured the
first time I had a baby was with somebody I love and that baby would be a…keeper."
51,Phoebe," Y'know you guys were a lot more supportive when I wanted to make denim
furniture."
52,Joey," No, Pheebs, listen, if you decide to do this, we’ll be supportive
like crazy."
54,Monica, We just want you to think it through.
55,Rachel," Yeah, honey, maybe you can talk to somebody who’s had a baby. Like
your mom?"
56,Phoebe, My mom never gave birth. Oh! But my birth mom did.
59,Chandler," Oh, yeah, sure, it’s not mine anyway. It can with the pants."
61,Monica, I am so jealous.
62,Rachel, You guys are really right…there aren’t you?
63,Chandler, Yes. Right where?
64,Monica," In the beginning where y’know it’s all sex and talking and sex
and talking and…"
65,Chandler," Yeah, you-you gotta love the talking."
66,Monica, And the sex?
67,Chandler," All right, we haven’t had sex yet. Okay, what’s the big
deal? Y’know? This is special, and I want our love to grow until we move on to the
next level."
68,Rachel," Oh, Chandler that is so nice."
69,Ross, That is really nice…lying! No way is that the reason!
70,Rachel," Why? Just because you’re not mature enough to understand something
like that?!"
71,Chandler," No, he’s right, I’m totally lying."
73,Monica, Then what is it?
74,Chandler," Well, Kathy’s last boyfriend was Joey."
75,Ross, And you’re afraid you won’t be able to…fill his shoes.
76,Chandler," No, I’m afraid I won’t be able to make love as well as him."
77,Ross," Yeah, I was going for the metaphor."
78,Chandler," Yes, and I was saying the actual words."
79,Monica," So big deal, so Joey’s had a lot of girlfriends, it doesn’t
mean he’s great in bed."
80,Chandler," We share a wall! So either he’s great in bed, or she just likes
to agree with him a lot."
81,Monica," Sweetie, with you it’s gonna be different. The sex is gonna be
great, ‘cause you-you guys are in love."
82,Chandler, Yeah?
83,Rachel, Yeah!
84,Ross, Just go for it Chandler.
85,Monica," Yeah, you should."
86,Rachel," Yeah, you should, really."
87,Monica, Go on.
88,Chandler," All right, all right, I’ll go sleep with my girlfriend. But
I’m just doing it for you guys."
90,Joey," Okay, now the Mastodon is from the semi-late Jurassic period."
92,Joey," Shhh! This is a museum, no talking. Right down here, (Motions to a
fossilised dinosaur foot.) we have a large foot. (Sees Ross working in one of the display
cases.) Uhh, and over here we have Ross Geller. (Knocks on the glass) Everyone wave
‘Hi’ to Ross. Ross is one of our most important scientists, look at him, hard at
work. (Ross does the old ""Putting a cigarette in your ear and pulling it out of your
mouth trick."") Okay, moving right along. Come on."
95,Phoebe, Hi!
97,Phoebe," I’m sorry, I’m late."
99,Phoebe, Wow! You really go all out when you’re expecting company.
101,Phoebe," Oh! Ooh! Oh, I didn’t know that you did…pot."
103,Phoebe," Ooh, erotiery!"
105,Phoebe, Okay.
107,Phoebe, Why not?
109,Phoebe," Oh no! No-no! I understand the pain! Don’t-don’t hurt the
puppy."
111,Phoebe," Oh, I get a puppy!!"
113,Phoebe, Why?
115,Phoebe, Okay.
117,Phoebe," All right, I’m sorry."
119,Joey," Uhh, do you mind sitting there. I’m-I’m saving this for my
friend Ross."
121,Joey, Doctor? Wow! I didn’t know he had a nickname.
123,Joey," Well, how-how come?"
125,Joey, That’s crazy.
127,Joey," I-I think everybody’s pretending they don’t hear you. Anyway,
look, I don’t know about you and your jackets and your separate tables, but Ross is
one of my best friends, and if I save him a seat, I’m telling you, he will sit
in it! (Ross enters and goes over to the white table) Ross! Ross! Over here, man! I-I
saved you seat."
128,Ross," That’s okay, I’m cool over here. I’ll catch up with you
later, Joey. (Joey is shocked.)"
133,Ross," (entering) Hey, uh, I’m really, really sorry about what happened in
the cafeteria today."
134,Joey," It’s no big deal. Hey, y’know, you do what you gotta do. Right?"
135,Ross," But hey, it’s not just me, I mean the scientists and the tour guides never
sit together."
136,Joey, Whatever.
137,Ross," It’s like that everywhere, Joey! Okay, Mon, back me up here. Where
you work the uh, waiters eat with the waiters, right? And the chefs eat with the other
chefs, right?"
138,Monica, I eat by myself in the alley because everybody hates me.
139,Joey," Look, Ross, really it’s-it’s no big deal. Y’know you wear a
white coat, I wear a blue blazer, if that means we can’t be friends at work, then so
be it. Y’know, hey I understand. Y’know? Hey, when I’m in a play and
you’re in the audience, I don’t talk to you, right? So it’s y’know,
it’s uh, it’s cool. I’ll see you tomorrow. (Leaves)"
140,Rachel," Yeah, when we’re in the audience he doesn’t talk to us, but he
does wave."
142,Chandler, Hi.
143,Monica, Hey!
144,Chandler, Why is Phoebe singing to Carl Mulden?
145,Phoebe," Ooh, y’know what, I think it’s time for puppy to go out again.
Come on, let’s go to the balcony."
146,Monica, What?!
147,Phoebe," Umm, the street. Come on, let’s go to the street. Ooh, listen,
don’t go onto the balcony until after I get back. (Leaves)"
148,Monica," (to Chandler) So, did you do it?"
149,Chandler," Yes, yes, we had the sex."
150,Monica," Uh-oh, it was bad?"
151,Chandler," It was fine, y’know? But she didn’t agree with me as
strongly as she agreed with Joey. She was more like, ""I see you point, I’m all
right with it."""
152,Monica," Well, it was the first time. Y’know, there’s not always a lot
of agreement the first time."
153,Rachel," Yeah, not girls anyway, guys agree (snaps her fingers) like that."
154,Chandler," Look, you have to help me! Okay? I mean, I know what to do with a
woman, y’know, I know where everything goes, it’s always nice. But I need to
know what makes it go from nice to, ""My God! Somebody’s killing her in
there!"""
155,Monica," All right, I’m gonna show you something a lot of guys don’t
know. Rach, give me that pad, please? (She does so and Monica starts drawing on it) All
right. Now…"
156,Chandler," Look, you don’t have to draw an actual wo—whoa! She’s
hot!"
157,Monica," Now everybody knows the basic erogenous zones. (She starts labelling
them) You got one, two three, four (Chandler is shocked to find out there’s more than
three), five, six, and seven!"
158,Chandler, (shocked) There are seven?!
159,Rachel," Let me see that. (Monica shows her) Oh, yeah."
160,Chandler, (Points to one) That’s one?
161,Monica, It’s kind of an important one!
162,Chandler," Oh, y’know-y’know what, I was looking at it upside down."
163,Rachel," Well, y’know, sometimes that helps. (She realises what that
could’ve meant.)"
164,Monica," (continuing) Now, most guys will hit uh, 1-2-3 and then go to 7 and set
up camp."
165,Chandler, That-that’s bad?
166,Rachel," Well if you go to Disneyland, you don’t spend the whole
day on the Materhorn."
167,Chandler, Well you might if it were anything like 7!
168,Monica," All right uh, the important thing is to take your time, you want to hit
‘em all, and you mix ‘em up. You gotta keep them on their toes."
169,Rachel," Oo, toes!! Well, for some people. (Chandler eyes her and her toes.)"
170,Monica," All right. Umm, you could uh start out with a little 1, a 2, a 1-2-3, 3,
5, a 4, a 3-2, 2, a 2-4-6, 2-4-6, 4, (Rachel starts getting worked up) 2, 2, 4-7, 5-7,
6-7, 7, …7..…7…7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7…(mouths 7)! (They both lean
back on the couch satisfied.)"
173,Ross," Thank you, Dr. Phillips, but I’m having my lunch at this table, here
in the middle. I’m having lunch right here, with my good friend Joey, if he’ll
sit with me."
174,Joey," (standing up) I will sit with you Dr. Geller. (He goes over to his table
and they shake hands.)"
175,Ross," Y'know, we work in a museum of natural history, and yet there is something
unnatural about the way we eat lunch. Now, I look around this cafeteria, and y’know
what I see, I see-I see division. Division, between people in white coats and people in
blue blazers, and I ask myself, ""My God why?!"" Now, I say we shed these-these
coats that separate us, and we get to know the people underneath. (He takes off his coat
and throws it down.) I’m Ross! I’m divorced, and I have a kid!"
176,Joey," (stands up, and throws his coat on the floor) I’m Joey! I’m an
actor! I don’t know squat about dinosaurs!"
178,Ross," All right, there you go!"
179,Joey," Yeah, you hang in there Teddy!"
181,Ross," Okay, good-good for you."
183,Ross," Wow, Rhonda."
185,Ross," Yeah, okay, Scott!"
188,Phoebe," My mom’s gonna be here any minute. I can’t do this, I
can’t give him up. Yes—no, I can. I don’t want to. But I can. No."
189,Rachel," Oo, I can’t watch this, it’s like Sophie’s Choice."
190,Monica," Y’know, I never saw that."
191,Rachel," Ooh, it was only okay."
192,Phoebe," Ooh, I can’t do this. My mom was right. If I can’t-if I
can’t give him up, then there’s no way I can give up a baby. Ohh, God, Frank and
Alice are gonna be so crushed. What-what else, what else can I give ‘em—a
kidney!"
198,Phoebe, Okay.
200,Phoebe, Oh! Ooh! Umm!
203,Phoebe," Hey, why don’t you?"
205,Phoebe," Uh-huh, yeah!"
207,Monica, What are you doing?
208,Phoebe," No, I’m really okay with this. Y’know why? ‘Cause look at
them, and I made that, so… I know it’s gonna be like a million times harder to
give up a baby but, oh my God, it’s gonna feel like a million times better, right? I
wanna do this. (To Frank and Alice) I wanna carry your baby."
211,Monica, It’s gonna be so great.
213,Phoebe," Oh, I-I gave them the puppy and it made them so happy that I decided
I’m gonna carry their baby."
215,Phoebe," No-no-no, I know, but you and I are different people though, and this is
a totally different situation, and I know that I am not gonna regret this."
217,Phoebe, Oh!
220,Monica, Would you ever be a surrogate for anyone?
221,Rachel, It depends on who asked.
222,Monica, What if I asked?
223,Rachel," Oh, Mon, sure."
224,Monica, Really?
225,Rachel, Yes. (Pause) You’re not asking are you?
226,Monica, No.
227,Rachel, Yes! Totally!
0,Rachel," What the hell is that?!! (to Monica) What the hell is that? Is
that you? (Monica nods her head no, and Rachel realizes what is making that sound.)
Ohhhhhhh! (storms over to Chandler and Joey’s with Monica in trail.) "
1,Monica," Boy, you are really not a morning person."
2,Rachel," (angrily) BACK OFF!!! (She starts banging on their door.) Get up! Get
up! Get up! God damn it! Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up!!"
4,Rachel, What is that noise?
5,Chandler, You!
6,Joey, It’s the chick! She’s…going through some changes.
7,Monica, What kind of changes?
8,Chandler," Well the vet seems to think that’s she’s becoming a rooster.
(The rooster crows.) We’re getting a second opinion."
11,Phoebe, Hey!
12,Ross," Hey, what are you doing shopping at eight in the morning?"
13,Rachel," Well, I’ve been up since six. Thanks to somebody’s
dumb-ass rooster."
14,Phoebe," You guys you really should get rid of those animals. They shouldn’t
be living in an apartment."
15,Rachel, Yeah! Especially not with all of these knives and cookbooks around…
16,Phoebe," All right. I’m gonna go to the fertility doctor and um, see if
I’m ready to have Frank and Alice’s embryo transferred into my uterus."
17,Ross," Now, how will they know if you’re ready?"
18,Phoebe," Oh, they’re just gonna umm, look to see if my endometria layer is
thick."
19,Chandler," Oh, I can uh, check that for ya."
20,Phoebe," Okay everyone, think thick."
22,Phoebe, Hi! Wish me luck!
23,Monica," Oh, good luck."
24,Joey, Good luck. (to Monica) And I’m still right!
25,Monica, That is sooo not true!
26,Rachel, What?
27,Joey," She’s mad because I know today’s her laundry day and that means
she’s wearing her old lady underpants."
28,Chandler, I can check that for ya.
29,Monica," I just—I can’t believe that you think that you and Chandler
know me and Rachel better than we know you."
30,Chandler," Well… we-we do. You can only eat Tic Tacks in even
numbers."
31,Joey," Yeah, what’s that about?"
32,Chandler," (to Rachel) And you… Ross, I believe, if you check Rachel’s
bag you will find a half-eaten box of cookies in there."
33,Ross," (He does so, and finds a half-eaten box of cookies.) You’re good.
(Tries a cookie.) These are not."
34,Rachel, I’m so not impressed. Everybody snacks when they shop.
35,Monica, Yeah.
36,Joey," Oh yeah? Ross, how many items left in that bag?"
37,Ross, Five.
38,Chandler," Okay, ten bucks says that we can name every item in that bag."
39,Rachel, How many guesses do you get?
40,Joey, Six.
41,Ross, Challenge extended.
42,Monica, Deal!
43,Ross, Challenge excepted.
44,Joey," All right, we’ll start with…apples."
45,Ross, We’ll be starting with apples.
46,Chandler, (to Ross) Stop that now!
48,Chandler, Yes!
49,Joey," Okay. Uhh, tortilla chips, yogurt."
50,Chandler, Diet soda.
51,Ross, Yes. Yes. Yes. (They’re perfect so far.)
52,Chandler, Orange juice.
53,Rachel, No! There’s no orange juice in there! We win!! 
54,Monica, Ha-ha!
55,Ross, They have another guess.
56,Rachel," Okay, well, we won that one."
57,Joey," Okay, the last thing…"
58,Chandler," Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh! (Whispers something in Joey’s ear.)"
59,Joey," No-no, not for like another two weeks."
60,Chandler, I got it! Scotch… tape. (They’re right.)
61,Ross, How did you know she would buy scotch tape?
62,Chandler," Well, we used there’s up last night making scary faces."
63,Monica," Aww, man!"
64,Chandler," All right! Ten buck! Fork it over! Cough it up! Pay the piper! Gimme
it."
65,Monica," That does not mean you know us better, I-I want a rematch."
66,Rachel," Yeah, and none of these stupid grocery questions, real personal
questions."
67,Monica, Yeah! And the winner gets a hundred bucks.
68,Joey, Serious?
69,Monica, Are you scared?
70,Joey," No! All right, who-who makes up the questions?"
71,Monica, Ross will do it.
72,Ross," Oh sure, ""Ross will do it!"" It’s not like he has a job, or
a child, or a life of his own."
73,Rachel, Fine! We’ll ask Phoebe.
74,Ross," No-no-no, I-I wanna play."
77,Phoebe, Oh! I knew it! I knew it! I felt really thick this morning.
80,Phoebe," Embryossss? As in, ""More than one?"""
82,Phoebe," Five? Okay, where am I giving birth, a hospital or a big box under the
stairs?"
84,Phoebe," That’s it! 25 percent? That means that’s it’s like 75
percent chance of no baby at all!"
87,Phoebe," Okay, well y’know what, don’t worry you guys, ‘cause
I’m-I’m gonna do this as many times as it takes to get it right."
90,Phoebe," Whoa!! That—okay, that’s a lot of pressure on me and my
uterus. (to Dr. Zane) So, well okay, so is there—is maybe is there something that I
can do y’know just to like help make sure I get pregnant?"
92,Phoebe, Wow! You guys really don’t know anything!
95,Monica," You guys! Do you realize that any minute now, Phoebe can be pregnant?"
96,Joey, Huh.
97,Rachel," I know! I know, it’s such a huge, life-altering thing."
98,Joey, I know.
100,Ross, The test is ready.
102,Ross," Okay, each team will answer ten questions. The first team that answers the
most questions wins. Okay, the categories are, Fears and Pet Peeves, Ancient History,
Literature, and It’s All Relative. Now, the coin toss to see who goes first. (He
flips the coin and they all watch it hit the table and stop. Then they all look up at him,
to see who goes first.) Okay, somebody call it this time."
105,Rachel, Tails!
106,Ross," It’s heads. (The guys celebrate.) Gentlemen, pick your category."
107,Chandler, Fears and Pet Peeves.
108,Ross, What is Monica’s biggest pet peeve?
109,Joey, Animals dressed as humans.
110,Ross, That’s correct. Ladies?
111,Monica, Same category?
112,Ross," According to Chandler, what phenomenon scares the bejeezus out of him?"
113,Monica," Michael Flatley, Lord of the Dance!"
114,Ross, That is correct.
115,Joey, (to Chandler) The Irish gig guy?!
116,Chandler, His legs flail about as if independent of his body!
117,Ross," Gentlemen, you’re pick."
118,Joey, It’s All Relative.
119,Ross," Monica and I have a grandmother who died, you both went to her funeral,
name that grandmother!"
120,Joey, (to Chandler) Nana?
121,Chandler, She has a real name.
122,Joey, (answering the question) Althea!
123,Chandler, Althea?! What are you doing?! 
124,Joey, I took a shot.
125,Chandler, You're shooting with Althea?!
126,Ross, Althea is correct.
127,Chandler, Nice shooting!
129,Rachel, We’ll take Literature!!
130,Ross," Every week, the TV Guide comes to Chandler and Joey’s apartment. What
name appears on the address label?"
131,Rachel, Chandler gets it! It’s Chandler Bing!
132,Monica, No!!
133,Ross, I’m afraid the TV Guide comes to Chinandolor Bong.
134,Monica, I knew that! Rachel! Use you’re head!
135,Chandler," Actually, it’s Miss Chinandolor Bong."
137,Phoebe," Hello, tiny embryos. Well, I’m-I’m Phoebe Buffay, hi!
I’m-I’m-I’m hoping to be your uterus for the next nine months. You should
know, that we’re doing this for Frank and Alice, who you know, you’ve been
there! Umm, y’know they want you so much, so when you guys get in there, really grab
on. Okay, and-and I promise that I’ll keep you safe and warm until you’re ready
to have them take you home, so… Oh! And also, umm next time you see me, I’m
screaming, don’t worry, that’s what’s supposed to happen."
139,Phoebe, Uh-huh. (To the embryos) Good luck.
141,Ross," All right, the score is nine to eight in favor of the guys. Ladies if you
miss this the game is theirs, pick your category."
142,Rachel, (shouting) It’s All Relative!!
143,Ross, You don’t have to shout everything.
144,Rachel, (shouting) I’m sorry!
145,Ross," Ooh. What is the name of Chandler’s father’s Las Vegas all-male
burlesque?"
146,Monica, Viva Las Gaygas!
147,Chandler, Unfortunately that is correct.
149,Ross," All right, we have a tie. Luckily, I have prepared for such an event. (He
opens up an envelope and holds up some note cards.) The Lightning Round!"
151,Ross," Thirty seconds, all the questions you can answer."
152,Monica," You guys are dead, I am so good at lighting rounds."
153,Chandler," I majored in lightning rounds. All right, we’re gonna destroy
you."
154,Monica," Huh, wanna bet?"
155,Chandler," Well, I’m so confused as to what we’ve been doing so
far…"
156,Monica," How about we play for more money, say 150?"
157,Ross, 150 dollars.
158,Chandler, Say 200?
159,Ross, 200 dollars.
160,Monica, You’re doing it again.
161,Ross, Excuse me.
162,Rachel," Monica, I don’t want to lose 200 dollars."
163,Monica, We won’t. (to Chandler) 300?
164,Rachel, Monica?!
165,Monica, I’m just trying to spice it up!
166,Rachel," Okay, so let’s play for some pepper! Stop spending my money!"
167,Monica," I got it! How about, if we win, they have to get rid of the rooster?"
168,Rachel, Oooohh that’s interesting.
169,Joey," Hey, no way, that rooster’s family!"
170,Rachel, Throw in the duck too!
171,Joey, What do you have against the duck?! He doesn’t make any noise!
172,Rachel," Well, he gets the other one all riled up."
173,Joey," Look, we are not gonna…"
174,Chandler," (interrupting) All right, hold on! If you win, we give up the birds."
175,Joey, (shocked) Dah!! (Chandler motions for him to calm down.)
176,Chandler," But if we win, we get your apartment."
177,Joey, Oooooh!
178,Monica, Deal!
181,Rachel," Monica, betting the apartment, I don’t know about this."
182,Monica," Rachel, I have not missed one question the whole game. I own this game!
Look at my hand. (Holds up her hand.)"
183,Rachel, Why? Do you have the answers written on there?
184,Monica," No! Steady as a rock! Now, are you with me."
185,Rachel," All right, let’s do it."
186,Monica, Come on!
187,Rachel, Okay. (They go into the living room.)
188,Ross," All right, gentlemen, you’re up first."
189,Joey, Okay.
190,Chandler, Okay. (Starts jumping around.)
191,Ross," You have 30 seconds. And the lightning round begins—stop it (Chandler
stops jumping)—now. What was Monica’s nickname when she was a field hockey
goalie?"
192,Joey, Big fat goalie.
193,Ross, Correct. Rachel claims this is her favorite movie…
194,Chandler, Dangerous Liaisons.
195,Ross, Correct. Her actual favorite movie is...
196,Joey, Weekend at Bernie’s.
197,Ross, Correct. In what part of her body did Monica get a pencil stuck at age 14?
198,Chandler," Oh! (Whispers something in Joey’s ear and then in Ross’s
ear.)"
199,Ross," Eww! No!! Her ear! All right, Monica categorizes her towels. How many
categories are there?"
201,Joey, Everyday use.
202,Chandler, Fancy.
203,Joey, Guest.
204,Chandler, Fancy guest.
205,Ross, Two seconds…
206,Joey," Uhh, 11!"
207,Ross," 11, unbelievable 11 is correct. (The guys celebrate.) All right,
that’s 4 for the guys. Ladies, you’re up. "
208,Rachel, All right!
209,Monica, Come on!
211,Ross," 30 seconds on the clock. 5 questions wins the game. The lightning round
begins…now! What is Joey’s favorite food?"
212,Monica, Sandwiches! 
213,Ross, Correct. Chandler was how old when he first touched a girl’s breast?
214,Rachel, 14?
215,Ross," No, 19."
216,Chandler, Thanks man.
217,Ross," Joey, had an imaginary childhood friend. His name was?"
218,Monica, Maurice.
219,Ross," Correct, his profession was?"
220,Rachel, Space cowboy!
221,Ross, Correct! What is Chandler Bing’s job?
223,Rachel," Oh gosh, it has something to do with numbers."
224,Monica, And processing.
225,Rachel, He carries a briefcase.
226,Ross," 10 seconds, you need this or you lose the game."
227,Monica," It’s umm, it has something to do with transponding."
228,Rachel," Oh-oh-oh, he’s a transponce—transpondster!"
229,Monica, That’s not even a word! I can get this! I can get this!
231,Monica, NOOOOOOOOO!!!!!
232,Rachel, Oh my God.
235,Joey, I call Monica’s room!
236,Chandler, You can’t just call Monica’s room.
237,Joey," Sure I can, standard shotgun rules, I’m sight of the room and I
called it."
239,Monica," Man, I feel like I’m coming down with something."
240,Joey, What?
241,Monica," Yeah. (to Chandler) I bet you can’t guess what color my tonsils
are? I’ll bet the apartment!"
242,Chandler," Oh, I would never bet this apartment. It’s too nice."
243,Phoebe, (entering) Hey!
244,Chandler, Hey!
245,Joey," Hey—ooh Pheebs, are they in there?"
246,Phoebe," Umm, yeah, uh-huh, they’re implanted."
247,Monica, How do you feel?
248,Phoebe," Well, freaked. ‘Cause it turns out that the odds are really sucky.
And! This is Frank and Alice’s like only shot. Like, they are literally
putting all of their eggs in my basket."
249,Chandler," Yeah, but I bet it works."
250,Monica, Really?! How much?!
251,Phoebe," All right, I’m gonna go take a pregnancy test, right now."
252,Joey, Oh wow! You can tell this soon.
253,Phoebe," Well the doctor says it takes a couple days, but my body’s always
been a little faster than Western medicine. "
254,Rachel," (entering from Chandler’s bedroom, I guess, and sees the foosball
table.) Oh my God! I can’t believe you guys are actually think you’re moving in
here!"
255,Chandler, Well believe it baby!
256,Rachel, Well I-I-I’m not moving.
257,Joey, What?!
258,Rachel," No, it was a stupid bet! We were just playing a game!"
259,Joey," You can’t just ignore the bet! It’s a bet! You bet and you bet
and if you lose, you lose the bet!"
260,Monica," Look Rach, we have to move. I mean if they had lost, we would’ve
made them get rid of the birds. Right?"
261,Rachel, Noooo.
262,Monica," All right, look, I hate this as much as you, but if it makes you feel
better, it’s all your fault."
263,Rachel, What?!
264,Monica," Chinadolor Bong, come on, we steal that TV Guide every week!"
265,Chandler, I knew it!
266,Rachel," I don’t care, I’m not going anywhere."
267,Chandler," Cool, girl roommate."
269,Monica, Well?
270,Phoebe," Nope, not knocked up yet."
271,Monica," It’s only been a couple of hours, so just give it some time."
272,Phoebe," Yeah, all right. Meanwhile, I’m gonna do whatever I can to help
this so, I’m just gonna y’know, lie it your chair, (She climbs into the chair
and drapes her feet over the back of the chair.) Y'know? Yeah, good, I’m let gravity
y’know, do its jobs."
274,Monica," Hey, Rach, can you give me a hand with this box?"
275,Rachel," No! Put that box down! We are not going anywhere! This is my apartment
and I like it! This is a girl’s apartment! That is a boy’s apartment, it’s
dirty and it smells. This is pretty. It’s-it’s so pretty! And look, and
it’s-it’s purple! And I’m telling you, you with the steady hand, I am not
moving, and now I have got the steady hand. (She holds out her hand, which is
shaking uncontrollably.) "
276,Monica, I’ll take care of it.
277,Rachel, That’s right! You do what the hand says!
279,Rachel, How did it go?
280,Monica, I lost our mattresses.
282,Phoebe," (singing) ""Are you in there little fetus? 
                            
In nine will you come great us? 
                            
I will buy you some Adidas."""
284,Monica, Hey!
287,Phoebe, Oh. Oh.
289,Monica," Hey, don’t mix those up, you could really ruin that lollipop."
291,Phoebe," All right, I will. No, I will. But umm, y’know just remember that
it’s still really early, okay so, if it says that I’m not pregnant, that
doesn’t mean that I’m not gonna get pregnant, okay and, and just please,
just so I don’t go completely nuts, just try not put all your hopes on this."
294,Phoebe, Great. (Goes to take the test.)
296,Rachel," Y’know what, you are mean boys, who are just being mean!"
297,Joey," Hey, don’t get mad at us! No one forced you to raise the stakes!"
298,Rachel, That is not true. She did! She forced me!
299,Monica," Hey, we would still be living here if hadn’t gotten the question
wrong!"
300,Rachel," Well it stupid, unfair question!"
301,Ross, Don’t blame the questions!
302,Chandler," Would you all stop yelling in our apartment! You are ruining moving
day for us!"
303,Rachel, Will you stop calling it your apartment!
304,Joey, But it is our apartment!
305,Rachel, No it’s not!
307,Phoebe," You guys! You guys! You’re gonna have a baby! They’re gonna
have a baby!"
310,Phoebe," Okay, but this can’t be good for the baby."
314,Monica, I can’t find garbage bags!
315,Rachel," Oh, I think I saw some in here. "
317,Monica, What is it?!
318,Rachel," I don’t know! But maybe if we keep that drawer shut, it’ll
die."
319,Monica, I can’t believe we’re living here!
321,Chandler, What?! What-what is it?!
322,Joey, Did you see the size of the closets?!
323,Chandler, I can’t believe we live here!
0,Chandler," Okay, she is the star of the play. And she is my girlfriend! I
get to have sex with the star of the play!"
1,Ross, People can hear you.
2,Chandler, I know!!
4,Chandler, Wow! She looks great. Doesn’t she?
5,Ross, Yeah.
9,Ross, That is one good looking man!
10,Chandler," Is it just me, or can you actually see his abs through his overcoat?!"
15,Ross, Dude!
19,Ross, Here’s your girlfriend’s button. (Holding the button.)
22,Phoebe," Oh, hey, Mon, do you still have your like old blouses and dresses from
high school?"
23,Monica," Yeah, I think I have some around here somewhere. Why? "
24,Phoebe," Well, it’s just that maternity clothes are so expensive."
26,Monica," Hey, Rach! I made a pile of your stuff over on this side of the room. If
you could just…(Rachel grunts and throws her purse at it)…throw your purses at
it."
27,Rachel, Bloomingdale’s eliminated my department. (Phoebe gasps)
28,Monica," Oh my God, are you out of a job?"
29,Rachel," No, but they stuck me in personal shopping. Which is just a huge
step down!"
30,Phoebe," Personal shopping? What is that? Like where you walk around with snooty
rich people and tell them what to buy?"
31,Rachel, Uh-huh.
32,Phoebe, That sounds great!
33,Joey, (entering) Hey! (Goes to the fridge.)
34,Monica," Umm, excuse me, we switched apartments. You can’t eat are food
anymore, that-that gravy train had ended."
35,Joey, (Holding a turkey leg) There’s gravy?
36,Monica," If you have the big apartment you have to deal with people coming over
all the time. That fridge has got to be stocked, okay, that’s your department now.
(She takes back the turkey leg)"
38,Monica, What are you doing?
39,Joey, I think I left a donut up here.
41,Ross, Hey!
42,Phoebe, Hey!
43,Joey, Hey!
44,Phoebe, Ooh! How was Kathy’s play?
45,Ross," Well, Kathy gets half-naked and simulates sex with a real good
lookin’ guy."
46,Chandler," Yeah, it’s like someone literally wrote down my worst
nightmare and then charged me $32 to see it!"
47,Phoebe, That’s a good idea for a business!
48,Chandler," I’m totally screwed. Okay, they are gonna be hot and heavy on
stage every night, and then they’re gonna go to their cast parties and he’s
gonna try to undermine me. Y'know it’ll be like, ""So where’s your
boyfriend, what’s-his-name, Chester?"" And she’ll go, ""No-no-no,
it’s Chandler."" And he’ll go, ""Whatever. Ha-ha-ha-ha!"""
49,Joey, (to Ross) That-that is a good trick.
50,Chandler," All right, look, look, what am I gonna do?"
51,Joey," Chandler, look they’re actors. They’re there to do a job, just
‘cause they work together, doesn’t mean they’re gonna get together. I mean
just ‘cause it happened with Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins, it doesn’t mean
it’s gonna happen with them."
52,Ross," Oh-oh, Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger."
53,Joey, Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman. 
54,Ross, Yeah.
55,Phoebe," Hey, Mel Gibson and Clint Eastwood."
56,Ross, They’re not a couple!
57,Phoebe," Oh-okay, I get the game now."
58,Joey," Okay look, look, let me ask you a question, when they were doing it on
stage, was it like really hot?"
59,Ross, Oh yeah!
60,Joey," Well okay, so then you’re fine. The rule is when two actors are
actually doing it off-stage all the sexual tension between them is gone. Okay? So as long
as it’s hot onstage you got nothing to worry about. It’s when the heat goes
away, that’s when you’re in trouble."
61,Chandler, Really?
62,Joey," Look, you guys have been to every play I’ve ever been in, have I ever
had chemistry on stage?"
63,Ross, No.
64,Joey, Noooo!!
66,Chandler," So uh, man, are you gonna go to the play with me tonight?"
67,Ross," Y’know what, I don’t know how comfortable I am going to see how
hot the sex is between some guy and your girlfriend."
68,Chandler," Yeah, I know but…"
69,Ross," Oh no-no-no, I’m there."
70,Monica, (entering) Hey!
71,Joey, Hey Mon! Want some pancakes?
72,Monica, You made pancakes?
73,Joey, Yep! Grab a plate.
74,Monica," Okay. (She does so and starts to walk towards Joey to receive her
pancakes.)"
75,Joey," No-no, stay right there. (Monica stops and Joey flips her a pancake, which
flies over her head and lands in the living room.) Gettin’ closer."
76,Chandler," Okay, okay, but don’t worry, because we also have cereals,
muffins, waffles, and, jams, jellies, and marmalades. Which I’m fairly certain
are the same thing."
77,Joey," Listen also we’re uh, we’re watching the game here Saturday
night, if people want to come over."
78,Ross, Oh yeah!
79,Monica," Oh, I was thinking about having people over for the game."
80,Joey," Oh yeah, who’s playing?"
81,Monica, The players.
82,Ross, Somebody seems to be missing being the hostess.
83,Monica," (laughs) Please, it’s a relief is what it is, is what it is."
84,Joey," All right Pheebs, stick out your plate!"
85,Phoebe," Oh. (Joey flips the pancake and Phoebe catches it and throws it on her
plate.)"
87,Rachel," (on the phone) Monica, I’m quitting! I just helped an 81 year old
woman put on a thong and she didn’t even buy it! (Pause) I’m telling you
I’m quitting! That’s it! I’m talking to my boss right now! (Pause) Yes I
am! (Pause) Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Okay bye, call me when you
get this message. (Hangs up as her boss, Mr. Waltham, walks in.) Oh! Mr. Waltham, I ah
really need to talk to you."
90,Rachel, Hi!
92,Rachel," Hi, I’m Rachel Green. What can I do for you Joshua?"
94,Rachel," Oh, I’m so sorry."
97,Rachel," Well, at least that’s a great suit."
99,Rachel, Okay.
101,Rachel," No-no, that wasn’t me! (To Joshua) Well, we should get started. Let
me show you my underwear. (Joshua turns at that) The selection of underwear we carry."
103,Rachel," Oh-oh, sorry, it’s this way, it’s this way. (Motions to the
correct way.)"
106,Chandler," I’m right! Right? There was like no chemistry between them.
Before they had heat, and now there’s no heat! Now you know what this means, Joey
told us what this means!"
107,Ross," All right, let’s not jump to any conclusions. All right? There was
some sexual chemistry between them."
108,Chandler," Come on, it was like cousins having sex up there!"
109,Ross," Here she comes. Don’t say a word, okay? Just be cool, don’t
be…y'know you."
111,Ross, Hey!
113,Ross," Oh, absolutely! (Chandler mumbles something.)"
118,Chandler," Oh, I loved the play. You were great, and Nick ditto. Clearly
you’re having sex with him."
119,Ross," Okay, I… (Walks away.)"
121,Chandler," Oh come on, it was so obvious! There was no chemistry between you two!"
123,Chandler," Y’know, I-I could see how this could happen, y'know you’re
up there every night, you’re naked, touching, kissing."
125,Chandler," Well, you can understand, given how we started."
127,Chandler," Well, that is what happened, and I don’t even see you denying
this!"
129,Chandler," Yeah, well, don’t expect that to happen anytime soon!"
132,Rachel," I have the best job in the entire world! The most adorable guy came over
today, and I got to dress him up all day!"
133,Phoebe, Rachel has a new doll.
134,Rachel," Oh, I wish he was a doll, then I could get a Rachel doll and bump them
together and make kissy noises. Oh! And he has the most beautiful name, I never realised
it, Joshua! Josh-u-a! Joshua! Josh."
135,Ross," Uh, hello!"
136,Rachel, Hi-e!!
137,Phoebe," Ooh, what do I smell?"
138,Joey," I don’t know, it smells good."
140,Monica, Fresh cookies! Hot from the oven!
141,Phoebe, Ooh! (They all go over to her apartment)
142,Monica," Please, have some!"
143,Ross," Oh, yumm!"
144,Monica," Yeah, I’ve just been fiddling around in here making delicious
treats for everyone."
145,Joey, (Holding a magazine) Wow! The new Playboy!
146,Monica," Yeah, it’s just something I picked up."
147,Ross," Cookies and porn, you’re the best mom ever!!"
149,Phoebe, What? What?
150,Rachel," Well, it was just something Josh said about v-necks, but you had to be
there."
151,Ross," Yeah, how does Jason look in a v-neck?"
152,Rachel, It’s Joshua.
153,Ross," Oh, whatever. (Laughs and gives Joey the thumbs up heading back to his
apartment. Joey follows him)"
154,Monica, Wait! Wait! This isn’t take-out!
155,Phoebe," (getting up) Well, I hate to eat and run, but…"
156,Monica," No, wait, please don’t go! I’ve got porn for you too!"
157,Phoebe," Yeah, I don’t need it."
158,Monica, People are supposed to wanna hang out here!
159,Rachel," Why? Honey, what is the big deal?"
160,Monica," I’m the hostess! Not those guys! I’m always the hostess! I
mean, I was always the hostess, I mean even when I was little, I mean the girls brought
their dollies to my tea party, I-I served the best air."
161,Phoebe," Well, why did you make like a whole big thing out of y'know, everyone
has to hang out in the big apartment?"
162,Monica," ‘Cause they took our apartment, I wanted to punish them. But
I’m-I’m done now. They’ve suffered enough."
163,Phoebe," If you wanted to punish them, you should’ve just made them hang out
here! "
164,Rachel," Yeah, that’s true."
165,Monica," All right then, when I’m done with this place, it’s gonna be
ten times better than that place!"
166,Phoebe," Oh, are we gonna trash that place?"
168,Chandler," Steps! (He opens the door to his apartment to Ross and Joey looking at
the new Playboy) Slut! (Ross and Joey quickly hide the Playboy behind
their backs. Chandler wonders into the girl’s apartment.) You will all be very happy
to hear that Kathy is sleeping with that guy!"
170,Ross, So you were right?
171,Chandler," I confronted her, and she didn’t deny it! (Pause) I don’t
live here! (Goes back into his apartment and they all follow him.)"
172,Ross, Chandler!
173,Rachel," Chandler, what did she say?"
174,Phoebe, Wait a minute.
175,Joey, Come here.
176,Monica, Are you sure?
177,Chandler," Well, I may be drunk, but I know what she said! Then I went over to Beefsteak
Julie’s…"
178,Rachel, Beefsteak Charlie’s?
179,Chandler," Yes! See you and I have always been like—(motions that they think
the same.)"
181,Rachel," Whoops. (Starts to go into Chandler and Joey’s.) Oh, hey, do you
need help with that?"
182,Monica," Nah, I got it."
183,Rachel," Ooh, I just feel bad, I never vacuum. (She goes into Chandler and
Joey’s.)"
185,Rachel, Hi!
187,Rachel," So I was with Joshua for an hour today, and he has not asked me out.
It’s just so frustrating!"
188,Phoebe, Why don’t you ask him out?
189,Joey," Oh, yeah, totally! That’s such a turn-on!"
190,Rachel, Really? It doesn’t seem desperate?
191,Joey," Oh-ooh, that’s the turn-on."
192,Phoebe, He just got a divorce right? 
193,Rachel, Hmm-mmm.
194,Phoebe," So he’s probably really nervous around women, y'know? Maybe, you
just have to make the first move."
195,Rachel," Yeah but, I’ve never asked a guy out before."
196,Phoebe, (shocked) You’ve never asked a guy out?!!
197,Rachel, No. Have you?
198,Phoebe, Thousands of times!! That doesn’t make me sound too good does it?
199,Rachel, I don’t even know how I would go about it.
200,Joey," Oh-oh-oh-oh, how I do it is, I look a woman up and down and say,
""Hey, how you doin’?"""
201,Phoebe," Oh, please!"
202,Joey," (to Phoebe) Hey, how you doin’?"
204,Rachel," You know what, I’m gonna do that, I’m gonna call him up, and
I’m gonna ask him out. I can do that. Ask him out. (Practising) How you doin’?
(Calls him) Hi! Joshua? It’s Rachel Green from Bloomingdale’s.
(Listens) Yeah, umm, I was wondering if you umm, if you umm, left your wallet at the store
today? Well, we found a wallet, and we—(Listens) the license? Well, that is a
good idea! Uh, well, let’s see here this says this license belongs to a uh, uh,
belongs to a mister uh, Pheebs, and umm, yeah, so sorry to bother you at home. I’ll
see you tomorrow. Bye. (Hangs up) (to Phoebe) You’ve done that a thousand times?"
205,Phoebe, I’ve never done that.
206,Rachel," Ohh, God, I just got so nervous that he would say no."
207,Joey," Well, you gotta give him something that he can’t say no too. Like uh,
Knicks tickets! Invite the guy to a Knicks game, you’re guaranteed he’ll say
yes!"
208,Rachel, Really?! You think that will work?
209,Joey," Absolutely! And if it doesn’t, can I get the extra ticket?"
211,Joey, What the heck is that?
214,Chandler, Did she call?
215,Phoebe," No, sorry."
216,Chandler," All right, maybe I should call her."
217,Joey," No! Forget her, man! You don’t need her, you don’t need that!"
218,Ross," He’s right, what she did was unforgivable."
219,Chandler," Well, yeah, but y'know, what-what if I was wrong?"
220,Ross, How might you be wrong?
221,Chandler," Well y'know, what if she didn’t actually sleep with the guy?"
222,Joey," Dude, tell me she actually told you this."
223,Chandler," She did not have to tell me, I saw the play, and there was no heat.
Back me up here, Ross!"
224,Ross, That’s all you’re basing this on?
225,Chandler," That’s not backing me up! Look, you said with the off-stage and
the heat, and the onstage and the oy heat."
226,Joey," Whoa-whoa, that-that was just a theory! There’s a lot of theories
that didn’t pan out. The lone gunman. Communism. Geometry."
227,Chandler, Oh my God!!
229,Rachel," Would you like to go to a basketball game with me? (Tries again.) You
know, its funny, basketball, because I happen to have tickets too… (Tries again.)
Umm, who likes the Knicks—(Joshua comes in from the dressing room.)"
231,Rachel," Oh! Well, as a single woman, who is available, I think you look great!"
233,Rachel," Yep. Oh, yeah, look you great. (She puts her arm in his and checks how
they would look as a couple.) Oh yeah. Yeah, this looks great. (Pause) Umm, so you like
it?"
235,Rachel, Great.
237,Rachel, Sure.
239,Rachel, Yeah-eah-ha!
241,Rachel," Oh well, you don’t want to do that now?!"
243,Rachel, Okay.
245,Rachel, Basketball!
247,Rachel," I uh, I have two tickets to the Knicks game tonight if you’re
interested, just as a thank you for this week."
249,Rachel, Really?
256,Chandler," Hey. I just, I just wanted to come over to-to say that I’m sorry.
Y’know? I know I acted like the biggest idiot in the world, and I can completely
understand why you were so upset."
258,Chandler," Yeah, I know, I-I wish I had too, but y’know I-I think this is a
good thing. Y'know? ‘Cause we’ve had our first fight, and now we can move on.
Y’know, I know for me—(Notices a pair of men’s pants on the chair.)
Nick’s pants?"
260,Chandler," Yeah. Well, I think our second fight is going to be a big one!"
262,Joey," Okay, for next time, what do you say?"
263,Rachel," I have an extra ticket. An extra ticket. Not, two tickets, I have an
extra ticket."
264,Ross," So the first time you ask a guy out, he-he turns you down?"
265,Rachel," He didn’t turn me down! He’s at the game isn’t he? I got
the date, I’m just not on it!"
266,Monica," (entering) Okay, it’s ready. Come on."
267,Joey, What’s ready?
268,Monica, Just come. 
270,Ross, Oh my God!
271,Rachel, Wow! Monica!
272,Phoebe, Great!
273,Ross, This is beautiful!
275,Phoebe, Oh did you—what did you—did you work for two days straight?
276,Monica," Pretty much. (to Joey) So, what do you, what do you think of the floor?"
277,Joey," I don’t know, it looks the same."
278,Monica, You used to have carpet.
279,Joey, Oh yeah!
280,Monica," So I made snacks. Please, just hang out okay? I’m just gonna rest
my eyes just a little bit."
281,Ross," Look, Mon, do you want us to uh, come back later?"
282,Monica," Oh no-no-no, stay, stay, stay, just keep talking. I’m always the
hostess."
284,Ross, Hey!
285,Joey, How’d it go?
286,Chandler," Well, she wasn’t sleeping with him."
287,Phoebe, Oh good!
288,Chandler, She is now.
289,Ross, What are you saying?
290,Chandler," I’m saying that she… is a devil woman! Y’know I mean
you think you know someone and then they turn around and they sleep with Nick! Nick, with
his rock hard pecs, and his giant man-nipples! I hate him, I hate her! Well, I
don’t hate her, I love her. This is all my fault really."
291,Phoebe, How? How is your fault?
292,Chandler," Because, I-I should’ve called! Y’know if I had just called
her after our big, stupid fight, she never would’ve gone out with Nick, and they
would’ve ended up in bed together. I threw her at his man nipples!"
293,Rachel," Honey, this is not your fault, just because you guys had a fight, it
does not justify her sleeping with someone."
294,Ross," Well, if-if she thought they were on a break…"
299,Rachel, Really?
301,Rachel," Yes! I will! Absolutely! (She takes out his license and her license and
holds them face to face with each other. She then proceeds to act like Dark Helmut in Spaceballs,
and mimic a conversation between the two of them.) Hello, Rachel. Hi, Joshua. I left my
wallet here on purpose. Really? Yes, I just wanted to see you again. Oh, I’m glad.
Rachel, I’d like to say something to you. Yes? How you doin’?"
0,Phoebe," (holding a lure) So now, what is this now?"
1,Joey, Guggly worm.
2,Phoebe, (laughs and picks up another lure) And this?
3,Joey, Glow-pop giggly jammer.
4,Phoebe, (laughs harder) You make it so funny.
5,Monica," (not wanting to be left out, picks up something) Hey umm, what’s
this?"
6,Joey," (examining it) Ohh, a hunk of sandwich from last year. (Monica drops the
sandwich)"
7,Ross," (pretend fishing in the living room) Ohh, Geller’s got one hooked!
Ohh! Looks like a big one! Yeah, ohh! Ohh! (Swinging the rod back and forth) It’s the
classic struggle between man and—(swings the rod and knocks over a lamp.) Someone
knocked over a lamp."
8,Joey," (going over and picking up the rod) That’s all right. Hey you guys,
you know what’s going to be great about the fishing trip this year? When my dad gets
me out in the middle of the lake and gives me that, ""Joey, what are you doing with
your life?"" stuff. I can say, ""Well, I’m doing a movie with Charlton Heston
dad. What are you doing with your life?"""
11,Chandler," You don’t have to stop having fun just because I’m here.
Kathy didn’t cheat on all of you. (To Joey) Well, except you. (They hug and Chandler
goes into the bathroom with the chick and duck following him.)"
12,Monica," Hey, Joey, I don’t think that you should leave Chandler alone. I
mean it’s only been two days since he broke up with Kathy. Maybe you can go fishing
next week?"
13,Joey," Look, there’s nothing I can do for him right now, he’s still in
his sweat pants, that’s still Phase One. Y'know? I’ll be back for Phase Two, I
would never miss Phase Two."
14,Monica, What’s Phase Two?
15,Joey, Gettin’ drunk and going to a strip club. 
16,Rachel, How does going to a strip club help him better?
17,Ross, Because there are naked ladies there.
18,Joey," Which helps him get to Phase Three, picturing yourself with other women."
19,Ross, There are naked ladies there too.
20,Joey, Yeah.
21,Chandler," (opening the bathroom door and kicking out the chick and duck) Would
you give me one minute!! Please."
25,Rachel," Um-hmm. (Joshua turns to look in the mirror and leaves Rachel staring at
his ass.) There we go. There it is."
27,Rachel, Yeah!
29,Rachel," Oh, okay. Uhh, well let’s see. (Grabs his hand.) You’re
about—well uh, this one is large. And this one—(Grabs the other hand.)"
31,Rachel," Yeah! Okay, two larges coming right up!"
34,Rachel, Yes.
36,Rachel, Sure. You got it. Great! 
38,Rachel," Me, Fledermaus, great. I really—(motions to Joshua.)"
41,Rachel," So? (She puts her hands in his, totally forgetting about the gloves, and
hoping for something more intimate.)"
43,Rachel," Ohh! Right! Right, sorry, I’ll be right back!"
45,Rachel, Oh.
47,Rachel, No! Nothing!
49,Rachel, Yeah! That would be great!
51,Rachel," (shocked) Well, I-I guess—I…"
53,Rachel," Yeah, great, you betcha!"
55,Rachel, What?
57,Rachel," Oh. Oh, right."
59,Rachel, Oh yay!
61,Chandler," Y’know, I can’t believe Kathy did this too me. I really,
thought that she was the one. I tell you what, from now on I’m never getting out of
this chair, ever! Okay? From now on, this chair is the one! You wanna what else is the
one? My sweat pants!"
62,Ross," Come on, man! Just-just take the sweats off. Okay? Just take ‘em off
and we’ll have some fun."
63,Joey, (entering) Hey-hey!
64,Ross, Hi!
65,Phoebe, Hey!
66,Ross," Catch any big fish? (Phoebe, Ross, and Monica all go over to him.)"
67,Joey," Oh my God, you guys have no idea. "
69,Monica, You stink!
70,Ross, Are you kidding?!
71,Joey," Yeah, three days on the lake without a shower. Plus! I fell in that big
tub of worms at the bait stand! Hey, how-how’s he doing?"
72,Ross, He hasn’t gotten out of that chair in two days.
73,Joey, (goes over to Chandler) Hey buddy! How’s it going?
75,Joey," (To the rest of the gang) Hey, see that? He just needed his pal to come
home. All right, uh, I’ve got to go memorise my lines. (Starts to go his bedroom) Me
and Charlton Heston bright and early tomorrow morning! Yeah-yeah!"
76,Rachel, (entering) Hey!
77,Ross, Hey!
78,Rachel," Hey, Monica!"
79,Monica," Uh-oh, what’s the matter?"
80,Rachel," Ohh, it’s Joshua invited me to this fancy club opening tonight.
But, I already told Mr. Waltham that I would take his niece to this dumb old opera.
So… What are you gonna do?"
81,Monica, I don’t know sweetie.
82,Rachel, No! Help me!
83,Monica, I can’t! I have to work!
84,Rachel, Phoebe?
85,Phoebe," I would, but I get my morning sickness in the evening. "
86,Rachel, Ugh!
87,Phoebe, Unless! She wants to spend the night holding my hair back for me.
88,Rachel," Ohh, gosh. You guys, come on, this is—I have to meet Joshua! This
is my one chance for him to see the fun Rachel. Y’know the ""Wouldn’t it be
great if she was my wife"" Rachel. Ohh, all right! Are Joey and Chandler back?"
89,Monica," No, Chandler’s still in Phase One, and Joey’s that thing you
smell."
90,Rachel, Ohh! (Realises that Ross is in the room.) Hi!
91,Ross, Hi!
92,Rachel, So….
93,Ross, No.
94,Rachel," Ohhhh, come on!!!"
96,Monica, I think she’s here.
97,Rachel," No! Wait! Wait-wait! Ross, please!"
98,Ross," You want me to take some girl I’ve never met to the opera so you can
go to a club and flirt with some guy, hmm, that-that is a toughie."
99,Monica," (looking out the peephole) Ohh, she’s looking down the hall. Oh!
She looked right at me! Oh wait, you can’t see people through that little hole, can
you? (Goes back to the door.) Hello!"
101,Rachel," I’ll be right there! (to Ross) Okay, Ross, please come on! I
thought we have moved on! I thought we’ve gotten to a place where we could be happy
for each other! I mean was that just me?"
102,Ross," All right, I’ll do it."
103,Rachel," Oh thank you! Thank you, thank you, thank you! (Monica opens the door.)
Emily?"
105,Rachel, I’m Rachel Green.
107,Rachel," There’s been a teeny-teeny change in plans. It turns out that
I’m not free tonight. So…"
109,Rachel," Oh well, no I…"
111,Monica, I-I-I think you look great.
114,Rachel, I’ll get her.
115,Ross, Please hurry.
116,Phoebe, Don’t you just love the way they talk?!
118,Phoebe, Ohh!
119,Monica, What?
120,Phoebe, It kicked! I think the baby kicked!
121,Monica, Oh my God!
122,Phoebe," Oh no wait, oh no, the elastic on my underwear busted."
123,Joey," (running from his bedroom) Oh my God! I overslept! I was supposed to be on
the set a half an hour ago! I gotta get out of here!"
124,Monica," Oh wait, Joey, you can’t go like that! You stink!"
125,Joey," Look, I know I feel asleep before I could shower and now I don’t have
time! They’re just ten blocks away, if I run, I can make it."
126,Monica," Yeah. Run ten blocks, that’ll help the smell."
128,Rachel," Hey—whoa, slow down. (Gets a whiff of him) No, keep moving. (Joey
runs off.) Wow!"
129,Monica, So? How did it go with Joshua last night?
130,Rachel," Well, I didn’t see Joshua last night, but I did punch a girl
in the face."
131,Monica, What?
132,Phoebe, Why?
133,Rachel," The whole night was horrible, it was pouring down rain, and when I got
there, there was no Rachel Green on the list, but there was a Rachel Greep."
134,Phoebe," Ohh! So, did you get to meet her?"
135,Rachel," No, there is no Rachel Greep, but then this other girl overheard us and
she was all, ""I’m Rachel Greep! I’m Rachel Greep!"" and he let her
right in. "
136,Monica, So you hit her in the face?
137,Rachel," No, she was already in, but then this big bitch behind me tried to steal
my umbrella, so I clocked her. Ohhh! I can’t believe this, all I wanted was a few
hours outside of work to see Joshua, so he can go ahead and start falling in love with me."
138,Phoebe," (going over to comfort her) Aww, Pheebs."
139,Rachel," Honey, that’s you’re name."
140,Phoebe," That’s short for Phoebe?! I thought that was just what we called
each other!"
142,Monica, Hey! You’re wearing pants!
143,Chandler," That’s right! Where are the guys? I’m ready to get drunk and
see some strippers."
144,Monica, It’s 930 in the morning!
145,Chandler, They got a breakfast buffet.
147,Monica," Hello. (Listens) Oh, hey Ross!"
148,Chandler," Ooh, let me talk to him!"
149,Monica," Oh-oh, my God!"
150,Chandler," Well, can I just…"
151,Monica," (to Chandler) Shh!! (On phone) Wait, what?"
152,Chandler, She’s shhing me! It’s my phone and she’s shhing me!
153,Phoebe, Shhh!! Please! What’s he saying?
154,Monica, He’s with Emily at a Bed and Breakfast in Vermont!
155,Phoebe, What? Oh my God!
156,Rachel, What? Who the hell is Emily—(realises) noooo!!
159,Rachel," They’re in Vermont!! How could this happen?! (She waves her arms
franticly and hits Chandler.)"
160,Chandler, Ow!
161,Rachel," How—how did end up in Vermont with that awful witch?! (She hits
Chandler again.)"
162,Chandler," Maybe, she doesn’t hit him all the time. "
164,Ross," When we first met her, she was soaking, her feet were wet! Who
wouldn’t be miserable? I’m telling you when I got her into a dry pair of shoes,
she was a totally different person."
166,Ross," I’ve gotta go, there’s a deer just outside eating fruit from the
orchard! (He hangs up and runs out.)"
168,Monica," He had to go, there’s a deer just outside eating fruit from the
orchard."
169,Rachel," I don’t get this! She was horrible! (She hits Chandler, yet again.)"
170,Chandler," Okay, I’m going to go stand over there. (Points and moves into
the living room.)"
171,Monica, Why do you care so much anyway?
172,Rachel," I don’t care! All right, y’know what I’m just upset that
I’m getting nowhere with Joshua that—y’know what still, you do not meet
someone and go flitting off to Vermont!"
173,Monica," Well, when you first met Barry, you flitted off to Vail."
174,Rachel," Oh, y’know, would you just for once, not remember
every…little…thing!! (Storms out.)"
175,Chandler," So y’know, uh, when’s he getting back?"
176,Monica, A couple of days.
177,Chandler," Y’know, I knew something like this was going to happen. (He
starts to take off his pants, revealing that he is still wearing his sweat pants.)"
178,Monica, What are you doing?! Chandler! You can’t just go back a phase!
179,Chandler," Yes you can. You’re thinking about time, you can’t go back
in time."
180,Phoebe," Well, look, why don’t you just, why don’t you do your Phase
Two strip club thing with us."
181,Monica," Yeah, come on, we can be guys!"
182,Chandler, (laughs) No you can’t.
183,Phoebe, Come on! Let us be guys! Maybe we want to be guys!
184,Chandler," You don’t want to be guys, you’d be all hairy and
wouldn’t live as long. (Starts to go to his bedroom)"
185,Phoebe," Y’know you, you just stop being such a wuss and get those off and
you come with us and watch naked girls dance around!!"
186,Chandler, Okay. (Starts to cry)
187,Phoebe, I’m sorry. (Goes and hugs him)
189,Joey, (rushing in) Hey! Joey Tribbiani! I’m here! I’m here! 
192,Joey," Look at that, Charlton Heston eating a liquorice whip!"
194,Joey," (trying to act like he’s not the one that stinks.) Whoa! Yeah, what
the hell is that? What smells so bad?"
196,Joey," Y’know, I can see why you think that, but ah, actually, you know who
I think it is?"
198,Joey," No-no, it’s uh, it’s Heston."
200,Joey," Yeah, the man wreaks! Smells like he went on a three day fishing trip and
then ate some liquorice. "
202,Joey," Really, a shower huh? And uh, which-which room might that be?"
204,Joey, Interesting.
206,Monica," (coming back to the stage and sitting next to Chandler) Okay, I’ve
got some Ones, you wanna put them in her panties?"
207,Chandler," No thanks, Mom!"
209,Phoebe," Oh, no umm, hi, that-that, you have to put that out, ‘cause
I’m pregnant."
211,Phoebe," Ha-ha, it’s not my baby, ha-ha-ha! (He leaves.)"
213,Monica," Very good, (getting up and sliding a One into the dancer’s hot
pants) so good."
214,Phoebe," (doing the same) I really, really enjoyed it. Very exotic."
215,Rachel," (joining them) Well, I just checked our messages and Joshua didn’t
call. I mean you’d think he’d be worried about me not showing up at his club.
Ugh, you know what makes it so much worse, Ross is all happy in Vermont!"
216,Phoebe, Come on! Look where you are!!
217,Monica," (to the waitress) When you get a sec, another round of daiquiris."
218,Phoebe," Remember, a virgin for me please."
219,Monica," Oh! And don’t let me leave without getting the name of that carpet
guy."
220,Chandler," Ahh, come on! Y’know what—y’know what, I think I’m
just gonna go home and call Kathy."
221,Phoebe," Well, if you think it will help."
222,Chandler," No! That was a test! In a couple of hours I’m gonna get really
drunk and wanna call Kathy and you guys are gonna have to stop me! And then after that,
I’m gonna get so drunk, I’m gonna wanna call Janice"
223,Phoebe, You should! How is she?
224,Chandler, Ohhh!!
225,Monica, I think somebody needs another lap dance. (Motions for one.)
228,Joey, How ya doin’?
230,Joey," I guess you wouldn’t believe me if I said I was Kurt Douglas, huh?"
232,Joey," No-no-no, no, no, wait. You see, I’m an actor, Joey Tribbiani,
I’m doing a scene with you today, and well, I stink."
234,Joey," Yeah-yeah, I’m one of the cops that won’t work with you
‘cause you a lose cannon. Anyway, look, I’m really sorry, but I stink!"
236,Joey, Yeah.
238,Joey," Oh no-no-no, you don’t understand…"
240,Joey," Oh yeah, yeah."
242,Joey," Yes sir! Yes sir, I’m-I’m—(he starts to leave)"
244,Joey," Yeah. Oh, yeah."
246,Monica," So, we did okay at the strip club, right?"
247,Chandler," Oh yeah, that was great. Thanks to you, the hottest cocktail waitress
there is quitting to teach the third grade!"
248,Rachel, (entering) I can’t believe it! He still hasn’t called.
249,Phoebe," Who, Josh?"
250,Rachel, It’s Joshua.
251,Monica," What, he doesn’t like Josh?"
252,Rachel," No, I don’t."
253,Chandler," All right, well I’m gonna put my sweats back on."
254,Phoebe," Oh no! Wait! Wait! Okay, y’know what, you were right, you were
right. We really weren’t great at being guys, but you know why? Because we’re
girls."
255,Chandler, Yeah?
256,Phoebe, And do you know what girls are really good at?
257,Chandler, Stripping!
258,Phoebe," No, listening! Sit! Y’know, maybe it would just really, really help
if you would just talk."
259,Rachel," Yeah, come on! What’s going in on in there? (Pats his chest.)"
260,Monica," Yeah. And y’know, if you wanna cry, that’s okay too."
261,Chandler," Okay, look, I’m gonna have to ask you all to leave."
262,Monica, Come on! Chandler!
263,Chandler," Look, forget it. We tried, but Phase Three is a lost cause, Okay?
Those strippers were insanely hot, and I couldn’t picture myself with any of them.
(Sits back in disgust.)"
264,Monica," They really were pretty, weren’t they? (Rachel and Phoebe both
agree)"
265,Phoebe," Yeah, I really liked that fighter pilot one."
266,Monica," Oh, Candy! She was so spunky! "
267,Phoebe, Yeah.
268,Monica," Y’know, I think if I were going to be with a woman. (Chandler is
intrigued.) It’d, it’d be with someone like Michelle, she was so oh, she was so
petite."
269,Rachel," See, I don’t know, for me it would have to Chantal."
270,Monica," Oh, Chantal!"
271,Rachel," Oh my goodness, she had the smoothest skin! I mean when I stuck that
dollar bill in her g-string and grazed her thigh…"
272,Chandler, (jumping up) Phase Three! I just achieved Phase Three!
273,Monica, Really?!
274,Chandler, I am totally picturing you with all those women!
275,Monica, That’s-that’s not Phase Three.
276,Chandler," Well, I’m there too!"
277,Rachel," Well, are we all together? Like in a group?"
278,Chandler," Stop it! You’re killing me! I think I just moved on to Phase
Four!"
279,Phoebe, Oh! What is that? What is that?
280,Chandler," Where I don’t want to have a relationship ever! I just want to
have sex with strippers and my friends!!"
282,Chandler," Come on, let me see that smile."
283,Joey, I don’t wanna.
284,Chandler, Please?
285,Joey, I wanted to go to the strip club!
286,Chandler," I know, I know, but you’re gonna have plenty of chances. There
are literally thousands of women out there just waiting to screw me over."
287,Joey," Yeah, all right. (Ross enters.)"
288,Monica, Hey!
289,Ross, Hey!
290,Phoebe," Hey—ooh so, how was Vermont?"
291,Ross," Emily is…incredible. I mean there-there are no words to describe it,
I mean the whole weekend was like a dream. (Sees Rachel coming back from the bathroom.)
Oh! And you! Rach!"
292,Rachel," Oh, hey!"
293,Ross, Hey! You were so right!
294,Rachel, What?
295,Ross," Uh, what you said, about us being in a place where we could finally be
happy for each other. "
296,Rachel," Oh, hmm."
297,Ross," I mean, I, I-I admit I-I wasn’t quite there. Y’know, I mean the
thought of you and that-that Josh guy…"
298,Rachel, Joshua.
299,Ross," Joshua…guy at that club, dancing and having a good time, the thought
of it kinda…y’know."
300,Rachel," Yeah, I…"
301,Ross," But now! I’m there! I’m totally there! I’m-I’m finally
where you are!"
302,Rachel," Oh, thank goodness!"
303,Ross," Yeah, and-and thank you for Emily."
304,Rachel," Oh, no problem. I’m so glad I could help. Happy for you. (She
playfully punches him.)"
305,Ross, Happy for you. (He punches her back.)
306,Rachel," No, happy for you! (Hits him harder.)"
309,Chandler," All right ladies, here’s what we’re gonna do. (Points to a
stripper.) You are gonna take off my clothes. (To another two strippers) You two,
go get the oils. (To another stripper) And you just constantly scream at the top of your
voice, ""Chandler’s the king! Chandler’s the king!"""
310,Phoebe," I-I wanna be with her, (points to the stripper next to her) I like her."
311,Chandler," Oh, that’s fine! Go with your instincts, go with your instincts."
312,Monica," Wait, now, what am I doing again?"
313,Chandler," Come on! Would you please pay attention, I could wake up at any
moment!"
315,Rachel," No-no-no, that’ not Joshua."
316,Chandler," What do you want from me, I’ve never met the guy. So anyway,
Rachel, I’m sorry you can’t stay, (Rachel is upset about leaving the orgy with
the cigarette guy.) but the rest of us have a lot of work to do. (The cigarette guy
starts rubbing Chandler’s back.) What are you doing? (The guy just nods) All right,
listen, I’ve got to wake up!"
0,Chandler," Y'know, I can't believe I'm getting my nails done!  And you
said it was gonna be fun! (pause) Which it kinda is.  Also, you said there would be
other guys here. There are no other guys here!"
1,Rachel," Chandler, there’s a guy right over there. (Points to the counter)"
2,Chandler," That’s a mailman! That’s our mailman! (Waves to the
mailman) (Sarcastic) Hi. How are ya?"
3,Rachel," Chandler, don’t worry! This doesn’t make you any less of a
guy! (Chandler starts blowing on his fingernails like women do.) That does!
(Chandler stops blowing.) What am I sitting on? (She looks and finds a huge nail.) I hate
to think what this woman was scratching when this broke off."
4,Chandler," Hey, you know who used to have nails like that?"
5,Rachel, Hmm.
9,Monica, Joey let me ask you a question. What does this light switch do?
10,Joey," Ohh, Nothing."
11,Monica," Didn’t it drive you crazy to have a switch and not know what it
did?"
12,Joey, I know what it did! Nothing.
13,Monica," They wouldn’t have put it there if it didn’t do something! How
can you not care?"
14,Joey, Like this. (Shrugs)
15,Rachel," Well, here’s another question for ya. Uhh, do you know what that
silver knob on the toilet does?"
16,Joey, Sure! It flushes it.
17,Rachel," Okay, good. Now that since you know, when you come over would you mind
actually using it?"
18,Chandler," (entering, with Janice in tow) Hello!"
19,Joey, Hey! (Sees Janice.) Ah!! (Janice screams in surprise.)
20,Rachel, Guess who we ran into today?!
21,Monica, Janice?!
22,Chandler, Isn’t this amazing? 
23,Monica, How have you been?
25,Phoebe," Ohhh, wow."
27,Joey, And there it is.
29,Chandler, Okay. Bye.
31,Chandler, Bye.
33,Chandler, Bye.
35,Chandler, B-bye!
37,Chandler," Bye. (Finally closes the door on her.) (After it’s closed) I
can’t stand the woman! (Phoebe is shocked, Joey is relieved.)"
38,Phoebe, What?! I thought you were crazy about her!
39,Chandler," Yeah, I know, but all of those little annoying things she did before
we fell in love? Like her voice, her laugh, her personality—Well, they’re all
back! Y’know? And she’s picked up like nine new ones!"
40,Joey, So what are you doing bringing her here?! There’s people here!
41,Chandler," Don’t worry about it. I’m taking care of it tonight.
(Chandler opens the fridge and grabs something to drink.)"
42,Rachel, You are not. You have never been able to break up with her.
43,Chandler," (standing in the door of the fridge) Well, I don’t have to break
up with her this time. We’re not involved! I’m going to do a pre-emptive strike!
I’m going to end it with her before it starts. My ass is like frozen! (Closes the
fridge.) "
44,Joey," Yeah, try sticking it in the freezer for 20 minutes. (They all look around
and then back at Joey.) I’m tellin’ ya!"
47,Ross," No, it’s really not that bad. I mean, I-I for one, feel perfectly
safe."
49,Ross, Help! Help!! Help! Help!!
53,Ross," Oh hey, that was a good one, huh? (Imitating himself) Help! Help!"
59,Ross," Oh, Liam. So uh, what, were you guys playing soccer or something—or
should I call it (In an English accent) football?"
63,Ross," What’s ah, what’s so funny about that?"
65,Ross," Well, we didn’t have freedom here until 1776, either so…"
68,Ross, Cheers!
72,Chandler," Yes, I-I know that you do, but I think one of the reasons people were
complaining though, was that they paid to hear the actor sing Old Man River."
74,Chandler," (laughs) Okay, we have to talk. I’m just getting out of a very
serious relationship…"
76,Chandler, Right! I just think that this is happening too soon.
78,Chandler," I hear ya. (Pause) But! Unfortunately, my company is transferring me
overseas!"
80,Chandler," No! No! Not, Paris. "
82,Chandler," Okay, could you just stop talking for a second? (Thinks) Yemen.
That’s right, yes, I’m being transferred to Yemen!"
84,Chandler, I don’t know exactly.
86,Chandler, But I do know that it’s some time tomorrow.
88,Monica, Done?
89,Phoebe, Yep!
90,Rachel," (entering, with Joey) Hey!"
91,Joey, Hey! What’s up?
92,Monica," This switch thing has been driving me crazy. So I turned it off and
checked every outlet. Now, four of them don’t work. Which means, one of them
has to be controlled by the switch. So, I plugged in things in all four of the outlets
that-that make noise, so that way, when I turn it on I just follow the noise and find out
which one it is."
93,Joey, (to Rachel) I bet I stopped listening before you did.
94,Rachel," Y’know, you-you also could’ve used uh, lamps and then
followed the light."
95,Monica," Yeah, well, I’m using noise. Okay. All right! So, is everybody
ready? Here we go. (She flips on the switch and a hum starts.) I hear something! I hear
something! Where is it? (They all start looking until Rachel realises it’s Joey.)"
96,Rachel, It’s coming from Joey!
97,Phoebe," Oh my God, that’s so freaky! Turn him off!!"
99,Phoebe," Ooh, hey, could we put on the news? I think it might be raining."
100,Ross," Oh, just hold on a second. I’m watching this rugby thing on ESPN.
I don’t know what the big deal is. I’m man enough to play this sport."
101,Joey," Dude, you’re not even man enough to order the channel that
carries the sport."
103,Ross, (shocked) Hey!
104,Phoebe, (whispering to Ross) Janice.
105,Chandler," Y’know uh, you didn’t really have to help me pack."
107,Chandler," Well, I-I thought I did but, I-I guess I did not!"
108,Joey," Hey-hey, what’s going on?"
109,Chandler," Oh, I’m packing. Y’know I’m-I’m packing
‘cause I’m moving to Yemen tomorrow."
110,Joey, Thanks for telling me!
112,Chandler," I’m only going to pretend I’m moving to Yemen, it’s the
only way I can get rid off her."
113,Joey," Ohhhh, good one! And Yemen that actually sounds like a real country."
115,Phoebe," Yeah, I know, I do that ‘cause it makes me look taller."
117,Chandler," (to Janice) Okay. (to Joey) Joey, trade lives with me!"
118,Joey," Nope. (To Ross) Man look at this! Ross, I can’t believe you said
you’d play rugby. I mean look how brutal this is!"
119,Ross," Hey, I can handle it! All right?"
120,Rachel," Please, Ross, you-you got hurt playing badminton with my dad."
121,Ross," That’s ‘cause-‘cause you’re mom’s dog kept-kept
looking at me."
122,Joey," (pointing to the TV) Okay, Ross, look-look-look-look, look right here.
That’s called a scrum, okay? It’s kinda like a huddle."
123,Ross," And is a hum, kinda like a scruddle?"
124,Joey, Ross! (Laughs) They’re gonna kill you!
125,Phoebe," Well, why are you doing this anyway?"
126,Ross," Well, you should’ve seen the guy that she used to go out with. I
mean, he’s like Joe Rugby."
127,Phoebe," You’re kidding! And he plays rugby?! That’s so funny.
(Realises) Ohh! I see how you did that. All right."
128,Ross," Anyway, she thought the very idea of me playing rugby with him was
like hilarious. So I’m gonna show her how tough I really am!"
129,Rachel," (starts laughing, Ross stares at her) I’m sorry. I’m sorry.
You’re right, you are a tough guy. You’re the toughest palaeontologist I know."
130,Joey," All right, come on look, Ross can take care of himself! It’s not like
he’s…Chandler!"
131,Chandler, (from his bedroom) Thanks!
132,Ross," Look, don’t worry about me. Okay? I’ll just stay real energetic
and stay away from the ball. I’ll uh, I’ll be that guy right out of the circle.
(He points to a player who starts running and then gets viscously tackled from behind.)"
134,Rachel," Oh, well maybe there was a dog lookin’ at him."
138,Joey," Ross-Ross-Ross-Ross! Stay away from that guy (Points), and that guy
(Points). And that one—Dude! They’re all huge!"
139,Ross, They don’t look any bigger than me!
140,Joey," Well, maybe that’s because you’re closer to you. So you look
bigger to you from where you are."
142,Ross, All right.
145,Phoebe, (to the player) Hi.
147,Phoebe, Whoa! (The player leaves and to Joey) I kinda liked it.
149,Ross," Okay, I know what I have to do. I’ve got to go Red Ross. (Joey and
Phoebe don’t know what he’s talking about.) Y’know, Red Ross!"
150,Joey, I totally don’t know what you’re talking about.
151,Ross," Come on! The time we were all waiting in line for Dances With Wolves and
that one guy cut in line in front of us and I just lost it?! Screamed at him! Turned all
red! Red Ross!!"
152,Joey, No.
153,Ross, You’ll see.
163,Ross, JOEY!!!!!!
165,Rachel," You…are…not going to believe it! Joshua came into work today,
and guess what happened?"
166,Monica, He asked you out?!
167,Rachel, No. But I was showing him some cufflinks and I felt his pulse.
168,Monica, Saucy!
169,Rachel, (refers to the table) What are these?
170,Monica, Electrical plans for the building.
171,Rachel," Okay, okay, okay should I be scared?"
172,Monica," I know that switch does something, okay? So-so I went down to city hall
and got these. All I had to do was pay $25 and wait in line for three hours."
173,Rachel, Wow! If only more people knew.
175,Chandler," Y’know you, really didn’t have to take me to the airport."
177,Chandler," Well, we’re really not that close. (Pause) Okay, so I guess this
is uh, good-bye then."
179,Chandler," Okay. Then I guess it’s just, wait here then. (Hands her the sign
that says, Wait Here."") (To the ticket agent) Hi. I need one fake ticket to Yemen."
181,Chandler," Oh no-no-no, no. No, no, no, I just, I just need a pretend ticket."
183,Chandler, What would you give to a kid if he wanted a ticket to play with?
185,Chandler," No. All right, y’know what, she’s (Points to Janice) gonna
think that I’m handing you a credit card, but what I’m really gonna do is hand
you a library card."
188,Chandler, (to the ticket agent) American Express?
191,Phoebe," No offence but, y’know sometimes it’s hard to understand you,
y’know with the accent, so…"
195,Ross," Did you see me? I was pretty good, huh? That is one fun game!"
197,Ross," (to Emily) Hey, could you do me a favour? Could you just grab me a bottle
of water? "
199,Ross," Thanks. (When she’s gone he collapses into Joey.) I-I think I’m
dying. I really do. "
200,Phoebe," Oh, poor baby."
201,Ross," (to Phoebe) Tell my son that I love him. (Emily returns with the water.)
Excellent! Well, okay, I gotta have some more fun!"
203,Ross," (whines ""No."") That’s not true!"
204,Phoebe, She’s right! You have to stop!
205,Ross," What? No! No, I’m not stopping. I’m Red Ross!"
206,Joey," Dude, if you go back out there, you’re gonna be Dead Ross!"
207,Ross, I don’t care! I am not quitting! I insist on finishing this game!
209,Ross," No, God no! That is no place for a woman. Those guys will grab anything."
211,Ross, I like that.
213,Ross, Huh?
215,Ross," All right, bad ankle, got it!"
217,Ross," Yeah? I can use that, trick hip, no cup, okay! Okay!"
219,Ross," But-but, Liam’s on my team."
221,Ross," I’m gonna go get him! Okay, I am going back in! (Squeals like a
madman.)"
222,Joey, The Red Ross! Okay.
224,Rachel, Hey!
225,Monica, Hi!
226,Rachel," (noticing a bunch of pictures around the door that weren’t there
originally.) What-what are-what are these?"
227,Monica," Oh, just some pictures I made and hung up. I thought they’d
brighten up the place. They do don’t you think?"
229,Monica," No-no-no, no!"
231,Monica," I know that there’s no hole there, I just really liked that
picture."
233,Rachel, Oh my God! Look at this!
234,Monica," Okay, but there is a wire back there! I mean that switch is
connected to something!"
235,Rachel, I don’t care! The wires have come loose in your head!
236,Monica," I just thought that if I could follow the wire I could find out what it
did."
237,Rachel, And did you?!
238,Monica," No. It disappears back there behind that baseboard. For a minute there,
I thought it went downstairs."
240,Monica, But it didn’t. Say hello to Mrs. Chatracus.
241,Rachel, Oh my God.
243,Rachel," Hello, Mrs. Chatracus."
245,Phoebe," Now, are you sure you don’t want to go see a doctor?"
246,Ross," Oh no! That-that’ll just bring me down! This was great! I mean I-I-I
was great! This is a great day! Y’know what? I’m buying everyone coffee. All
right? If someone would just grab my wallet, it’s in my pocket. "
247,Joey," Yeah, sure."
248,Ross," No, not you. (Emily gets it.)"
249,Joey," Uhh, look, your eye’s still popping out a little, I’m gonna go
get some ice."
250,Phoebe," Ooh, ice! I am so in the mood for ice! (They go and get the coffee and
the ice leaving Ross and Emily alone.)"
252,Ross," Oh, I kinda was, wasn’t I?"
254,Ross," I made a man twice my size cry. I mean, I haven’t done that since I
was four and I washed my dad’s Porsche with rocks."
256,Ross," Please! Are you kidding? I-I hurt three huge men, I gave a guy a bloody
nose—I mean I-I’m not proud of it but, I really am. And it’s all because of
you, wonderful, amazing you."
258,Ross," No, no, I’m serious. Thank you."
260,Ross," It’s worth the pain. (She goes to hug him again.) Y’know what,
you know what? It’s not."
263,Chandler," Well, I-I guess I gotta go."
265,Chandler," Well, just until we find an energy source to replace fuel."
267,Chandler," Okay, good-bye. Good-bye. "
270,Chandler, No!
272,Chandler," Janice! There you are! There you are! I had to have one last kiss, and
also-also you said that you were going to leave right after I got on the plane!"
274,Chandler," Well, I then guess I’m going to Yemen! I’m going to Yemen!
(To this old woman also going to Yemen.) When we get to Yemen, can I stay with you?"
277,Monica," All right. The super couldn’t figure out what it did. A $200 an
hour electrician couldn’t figure out what it did. I’ve had seven pretty serious
shocks. I officially give up."
278,Rachel, Thank God.
279,Monica," I guess Joey was right, it does nothing."
281,Phoebe," See? I’m doing it. I am totally doing it. (Suddenly it stops
working.) I lost it."
0,Monica, What is it hon?
1,Phoebe," I-I can’t find anything that I want to eat! Everything I eat makes
me nauseous! I’m telling you, being pregnant is no piece of cake—ooh! Cake!
(Chandler shrugs, and Phoebe grimaces.) No."
2,Monica," Aww, honey I’m sorry."
3,Phoebe," God! Ooh! What is that smell? It’s coming from the bathroom. Ooh!
(She goes to the bathroom.)"
4,Chandler, Wow! Pregnancy does give you some weird cravings.
6,Joey, Yeah?
7,Phoebe," It’s me. It’s Phoebe. Listen there’s something in here I
want to eat, what-what smells so good?"
9,Joey, Is it the shampoo? It’s guava.
10,Phoebe, (she smells his head) No!
11,Joey, Oh! Wait-wait! (Reaches inside the shower.) Is it my bologna sandwich?
12,Phoebe," Yes. Yes. Yes. I can’t believe it! The baby wants bologna! Maybe he
wants me to eat meat? I can’t eat meat!"
13,Joey," Oh, wait-wait! (Reaches into the shower again.) Maybe it’s a pickle?!"
17,Chandler, What are you writing?
18,Rachel," Well, Joshua’s coming in tomorrow and since I don’t have the
guts to ask him out, I’m going to sell him a coat and put this note in the pocket."
19,Chandler," Oh yeah? (He grabs the pad and starts reading it.) Joshua, give me a
call sometime, guys like you (Pause) never go out of style—what did you throw away?"
21,Chandler, Hi guys!
23,Joey," Hey, what have you guys been up too?"
24,Ross," Oh, we went to see a collection of Victorian doorknobs and the
Cupert-Hewitt museum."
25,Chandler, Without me?!
27,Ross, Yeah.
29,Monica," I don’t know how museums work in England but, here, you’re not
supposed to take stuff."
31,Ross, Bye. (They kiss.)
33,Joey, Wow! You guys seem to be having a good time.
34,Ross," Oh yeah, she’s-she’s amazing. And-and she’s so much fun.
And! Y’know what? When I’m with her, I’m fun! I even signed up for
helicopter classes. (Chandler is shocked.) She’s leaving in two days, I don’t
have to do it."
35,Monica," Oh no, two days, you must be bummed."
36,Ross," Yeah, she’s got to go back to London. But you know what? I’ve
been prepared for this from the start. We both knew we had two weeks together, and
that’s it. Y’know."
37,Joey, Hey that’s what all my relationships are like.
38,Chandler," Yes, but in Ross’s case, they both know in two weeks
that’s it."
40,Ross, Pheebs!
42,Ross, (starts rubbing her belly) Hello! Hello!
43,Phoebe," (angered by the rubbing) Yes! I know! I know! Yeah! So the baby is
totally craving meat. This afternoon I tried tricking it, I made it a soy-burger to make
it think it was getting meat, y’know? And I got nauseous."
44,Chandler, Maybe that’s because soy-burgers suck!
45,Phoebe, Being pregnant is tough on your tummy.
46,Joey," Hey, but at least you got that cool, pregnant lady glow."
47,Phoebe," That’s sweat. You throw up all morning, you’ll have that glow
too."
50,Rachel," Oh, here’s that trench-coat that you wanted."
52,Rachel, Yeah?
54,Rachel," (stopping him) Oh no-no, no-no, they don’t want you to put your
hands in the pockets until you are out of the store."
56,Rachel," Well, that’s because of a lot of…(She imitates someone picking
their nose and placing the treasure found in the pockets.)"
58,Rachel, I know!
60,Rachel, Oh?
62,Rachel," Well, congratulations, so do you love her?"
64,Rachel," Huh. Well, uh, that’s uh, that’s interesting. (She goes over
and retrieves her note.)"
66,Rachel," Oh, it’s just an anti-theft device."
68,Rachel," You need that, you need that too ‘cause obviously, a thief could
just tear this up. (Rips up the note.)"
70,Rachel," Oops, sorry. Listen, we-we have to have a party tonight! Actually, we
have to have one in five minutes, so everybody cancel your plans."
71,Chandler, What are you talking about?
72,Joey," Yeah, what’ going on?"
73,Rachel," We have to have a surprise Bon Voyage party for Emily. But it’s
actually for Joshua. (Starts handing out party hats.) Look, he said he’s not ready to
date, so I had to invite him to a party if I wanted to see him outside of work, and now I
have the perfect opportunity to seduce him! (Hands Ross a party hat.)"
74,Ross," Well, as much as I’d like to meet Josh and warn him, Emily and I
aren’t going to be here. All right? I mean, she’s going to come by first to say
good-bye, and then I’ve got a whole special evening planned. So I’m sorry, no
party."
75,Joey, Awwww!
77,Rachel, Surprise!!!
80,Rachel," Well, it was all Ross’s idea."
82,Ross, You really didn’t know?
84,Chandler," Why are you in here if Joshua is all the way over there? (Points to
the living room.)"
85,Rachel," Uhh, because I’m trying to play hard to get. Oh, quick he’s
looking over here, say something funny."
86,Chandler, Like what?
88,Joey, What-what-what is so funny?
89,Chandler," I said, ""Like what?"""
90,Joey, Now that’s a thinker.
91,Rachel," Okay, y’know what, y’know what? This playing hard to get thing
is not working. Umm, hand-hand me those cherries. (Chandler does so.) Okay. Okay. (She
does a little sexy walk over to where Joshua is standing.) Hi!"
93,Rachel, Care for a cherry?
95,Rachel," No? Y’know, I can tie one of these into a knot using just my
tongue. "
98,Ross, (interrupting Monica and Emily) So we should probably get going soon.
100,Ross," Yeah, but we-we have to be at the Four Seasons for drinks in 15
minutes and then y’know, then The Plaza for dinner."
102,Ross," No-no-no, no, umm, actually American surprise parties are-are-are very
short. It’s usually, ""Surprise!"" And then, ""Oh my God, I’m so
surprised—good-bye!"""
104,Ross," Monica said that did she? (He squeezes Monica’s knee really hardly
and Monica winces in pain.)"
106,Phoebe," Ooh, yeah. Then what are you going to put on top of that?"
107,Joey, A little salami. 
108,Phoebe," Ooh yeah! Then umm, what goes on top of the salami?"
109,Joey, Pastrami. 
110,Phoebe," Oooh, yeah. You’re a genius."
112,Rachel," Oh, could somebody give me a hand with this zipper?"
113,Joey, Yeah. (He goes over to her.)
114,Rachel, Up!
115,Monica, You changed?
116,Rachel," Yeah, I did. I needed my lucky dress."
117,Monica," And lucky means, more cleavage? "
118,Chandler, Does for me.
120,Rachel," Ohh, God! Look at him, he’s so cute. I wanna go over there, grab
him, and kiss him! How can I kiss him and not letting him know that I like him?"
121,Joey," Oh! I know how you can get him, take off your bra."
122,Rachel, What?
123,Joey, There was a seen in Footloose...
124,Chandler, Flashdance.
125,Joey," Yeah-yeah, yeah, with that-that uh, plumber girl…"
126,Chandler, She was a welder.
127,Joey," What? Were you like in the movie, or… Anyway, she takes off
her bra under her shirt and pulls it out the sleeve. Very sexy, and classy."
128,Monica," Or if you want to kiss him, umm, you could use mistletoe."
129,Rachel, It’s not Christmas!
130,Monica, Or Spin the Bottle?
131,Rachel, He’s not 11!
133,Rachel, What? You’re leaving?!
134,Ross," Yes, we have something we have to get to."
136,Rachel," No! You guys can’t leave yet! You have to stay, we-we got the whole
big thing planned!"
137,Ross, What big thing?
139,Rachel," (spinning the bottle) So, Spin the Bottle works like this I spin the
bottle, it lands on Gunther, so I would have to kiss Gunther. (She crawls over to where
Gunther is sitting and sees the look of anticipation on Gunther’s face and decides
not to kiss him.) All right. Who wants to go first?"
143,Joey, Welcome to America. (They both kiss.)
145,Monica," Two in a row! You’ve got to use your tongues now! (They kiss
again.)"
146,Rachel, Yay! Emily! 
148,Chandler, What are the odds? What are the odds?
150,Ross," (stopping them) Okay, that-that’s enough! Y’know, let’s,
let’s let someone else play."
151,Joey," If you didn’t want to play, why did you come to the party?"
152,Rachel," Okay, my turn!!"
154,Phoebe, Oh my God!! The baby just kicked!
156,Rachel," It’s okay! It’s okay! It kicked once, it’ll kick again!"
159,Rachel," All right, well, everybody just remember where they were sitting. "
161,Rachel, Just a bug.
164,Phoebe," Y’know it doesn’t matter how much I’m craving it.
Y’know why I’m never gonna eat meat? Because it’s murder, cold blooded
murder."
165,Chandler, Okay. 
167,Chandler," There’s a Phoebe on my sandwich! (He walks away, giving the
sandwich to Phoebe.)"
168,Joey," Phoebe, what-what are you doing?!"
169,Phoebe, I can’t help it. I need the meat. The baby needs the meat.
170,Joey," All right look, y’know how-y’know how when you’re dating
someone and you don’t want to cheat on them, unless it’s with someone really
hot?"
171,Phoebe," Yeah, totally!"
172,Joey," All right. Okay. Well this is the same kind of deal. If you’re going
to do something wrong, (He grabs two steaks from the freezer) do it right!"
174,Joey, Feel better now?
175,Phoebe," Yeah, but at what cost? Six more months, three meals a day, I’m
gonna eat like, y’know millions of cows."
176,Joey," Hey, what if I said, I could even things out for ya, meatwise."
177,Phoebe, What?
178,Joey," Well, I eat a lot of meat right?"
179,Phoebe, Yeah.
180,Joey," Well, suppose until the baby’s born I laid off it. No extra animals
would die, you-you’d just be eating my animals."
181,Phoebe," Joey, I can’t believe you would do that for me."
182,Joey," Absolutely! I could be a vegetarian. There’s no meat in beer, right?"
184,Ross," Okay, we could still make dinner if we skipped the appetisers and asked
for our check right away."
187,Monica, Oh my God! Have you lost your mind?
188,Rachel," No-n-n-n-no! I am finally thinking clearly. My lucky dress
wasn’t working out to well for me, but for four years, this baby never missed."
189,Monica," Rachel-Rachel-Rachel I-I cannot, I can’t let—(pause), actually
I kinda want to see what happens."
191,Rachel, Hi!
193,Rachel," Ohh, yeah, well I wanted to give Emily a big American good-bye
cheer. So okay! (Runs into the living room) Ready! Okay! Gimme an ‘E!’"
195,Rachel, Gimme an ‘M!’
197,Rachel, Gimme an ‘I!’
199,Rachel, Gimme an ‘L!’
201,Rachel, Gimme a ‘Y!’
203,Rachel," What do you get? (She throws her pom-poms to Joey and Phoebe and
performs a cartwheel.) Emily!! (Tries to do another one.) Emil—Whoa!! (She falls in
Chandler’s room.) Okay! So that’s me as a cheerleader! Ta-dum! (Gunther’s
the only one that claps.)"
206,Rachel," I’m fine! I’m fine! I’m just losing a tooth, it’s no
big deal. I have a dentist! Y’know. I’m gonna go put some ice on it. Excuse me.
(She goes over to the ice and Joey and Monica follow her.) What do I do now? What do I do
now?"
207,Monica, I think you’re done.
208,Joey," Okay, time to take off the bra. (She glares at him.)"
210,Joey, (trying not to be obvious) Take the bra off.
211,Rachel," All right, come on, let’s go get your coat."
218,Rachel," Oh, yeah! Real fun. (She makes a decision.) Y’know, this bra…
Really, bothers me. (She starts taking off her bra.) Y’know, this used to be my
bedroom. Yeah. A lot of memories in here, a lot of memories. If these walls could
talk, y’know what they’d say? Wanna hear some memories? (She is now violently
pulling on her bra in order to remove it, but it isn’t co-operating.)"
220,Rachel," Oh no-no-no! No, I got this all under control."
223,Rachel," Ughhhh!! Forget it! (Sits down heavily on the bed.) This is, this is not
how this is supposed to happen."
225,Rachel," Can you not look at me when I say this? (He turns around) I thought that
if I could get you here, I could seduce you."
227,Rachel," Well, I’m sorry, I thought you needed them!"
229,Rachel, Why?!
231,Rachel, You like me?
233,Rachel," Yeah but-but-but you liked me! Oh my God, I can’t believe this, all
this time, I liked you and you liked me!"
235,Rachel," Oh no-no-no don’t say but! No-no, but’s never good! Let’s
just leave it at, you like me and I like you."
237,Rachel," Oh, now see that’s a fancy but."
239,Rachel, But….
241,Rachel, Okay.
243,Rachel," Ohh, here you are. I was looking for you before. Joshua’s gone so
you and Emily are free to go."
244,Ross," That’s okay. She’s still in there enjoying her fake party and
uh, it’s too late to do any of the things I had planned, so…"
245,Rachel," Oh, Ross, I’m sorry. I completely ruined your evening."
246,Ross, Yeah.
247,Rachel," Well, if it makes you feel any better, I made a fool out of myself."
248,Ross, Helps a little.
249,Rachel, Is there room on that step for a pathetic loser?
250,Ross," Yeah, have a seat."
251,Rachel, I’m so sorry.
252,Ross," That’s okay, I mean it was just two-week thing anyway, I just
didn’t want it to end this way, y’know?"
253,Rachel," Well, maybe you didn’t want it to end?"
254,Ross, What do you mean?
255,Rachel, You seem to really like her.
256,Ross," Yeah, I really do. Yeah, but what am I gonna do, I mean we-we both agreed
that it was gonna be a two-week thing, y’know no commitment."
257,Rachel," Ross, that girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends,
asking to hear stories about you, looking through Monica’s photo albums, I mean you
don’t do that if you’re just in it for two weeks."
258,Ross, You think?
259,Rachel," Yeah, you got like 14 hours until she has to be at the airport, and
you’re sitting here in the hallway with a 28-year-old cheerleader with a fat lip."
260,Ross," Hey, you’re right."
261,Rachel, Yeah.
262,Ross, Thanks. (He starts to go inside and stops.) What photo album was it?
263,Rachel," I don’t know, it was you and a bunch of albino kids."
264,Ross," Oh my God! Those weren’t albino kids, that was computer camp! Rach!
(He hurries inside and Chandler is taking out the garbage.)"
265,Rachel, Hey.
266,Chandler, Hey.
267,Rachel," You’re a pathetic loser, right?"
268,Chandler," Oh-ho, yeah!"
269,Rachel, Sit!
272,Rachel," Oh my gosh, Joshua!"
274,Rachel, They’re not true?
276,Rachel, Oh.
278,Rachel," Oh! Oh, I love that but."
280,Rachel, You wanna go inside and have some coffee?
282,Rachel, Okay. (Joshua goes inside and to Chandler.) Every time.
285,Joey," Oooh, what you got there?"
286,Phoebe, Pastrami.
287,Joey," Oh-ho-ho, yeah! Hey! Y’know what goes good with that?"
288,Phoebe," Hm-mm, corn beef."
289,Joey," Ooh, I was gonna say bologna, but that’s much better. How about a
little of that smoked turkey?"
290,Phoebe, Okay.
291,Joey," (He starts looking longingly at the sandwich.) Oh mama! Uh when-when is
the baby due?"
292,Phoebe, Six months.
293,Joey," Ugh. Now if a cow should die of natural causes, I can have one of those
right?"
294,Phoebe, Not if I get there first.
1,Joey, (coming in from his bedroom) What is that?
2,Chandler, Treeger’s snaking the shower drain.
4,Joey, Maybe he found you flip-flop.
6,Chandler, Hey!
7,Joey," Whoa! Is this porn? What did I do? I must’ve hit something on the
remote."
8,Chandler, Do we pay for this?
9,Joey," No, we didn’t even pay our cable bill—maybe this is how they
punish us."
10,Chandler, Maybe we shouldn’t pay our phone bill—free phone sex.
11,Joey," Maybe we shouldn’t pay our gas bill? (Stops and thinks about what he
just said.)"
13,Chandler," Yeah, Joey just pressed something on the remote and it just, came on!"
15,Chandler, Like finding money with naked people on it!
17,Joey, (to Chandler) Why would he turn off the TV? (Chandler shrugs.)
20,Rachel," All right, y’know what, come on, do we really have to watch this
while we eat? (She makes a move for the remote.)"
22,Chandler, We don’t know what could make this go away.
23,Joey," Yeah, so no one touches the remote. And no one touches the TV!"
24,Chandler, And no one touches the air around the TV!
25,Joey," Imagine a protective porn bubble if you will, okay?"
26,Monica," Well at least, I’m going to mute it."
28,Chandler, We still have porn.
29,Joey, Hey.
30,Phoebe," (entering, carrying her massage table) Hi!"
31,Monica, Hi!
32,Rachel," Honey, what are you doing? That’s too heavy."
33,Phoebe, Yeah.
34,Rachel," Give it here. (She takes the table.) Oh, God. (And gives it to Monica
right away.)"
35,Monica, Okay.
36,Phoebe," Ohh, I’m getting too pregnant for this, lugging around a stupid
massage table. Y’know, I have to find a job where I carrying a smaller table. (She
goes over and stands in front of the TV.)"
37,Chandler, Or a job where you don’t have to carry a table.
38,Phoebe, You mean like a doctor?
39,Joey, Pheebs! You’re blocking the porn! Look out!
40,Phoebe," Ohh! (She moves.) Oh my. Oh, that reminds me, I have to see my OB-GYN
today."
42,Ross, Hi.
43,Monica, Hi.
44,Ross," So uh, Emily just went to the airport."
45,Monica, Oh. Why didn’t you take her?
46,Ross," Eh, her-her uncle already had planned on doing it. And y’know, we-we
said our good-byes this morning, so…"
47,Monica, You must feel horrible. Hey! The guys have free porn!
48,Ross, (Thinks about it.) Nah.
49,Monica," Hey, cheer up! You’re gonna see her again, right?"
50,Ross," Well I, that’s the thing, I don’t know! I mean, whenever I
brought it up with her she said, (In a British accent.) ""This is so fantastic! Why do
we have to talk about the future? Let’s just enjoy…"""
51,Monica," (interrupting him) No-no-no, don’t-don’t do the accent.
You’ve got to see her again."
52,Ross, And why do you care so much?
53,Monica, Because! You could get to live out my fantasy!
54,Ross, You had fantasies about Emily?
55,Monica," No! Y’know, the fantasy! Meet someone from a strange land,
fall in madly love, and spend the rest of your lives together."
56,Ross," Is that why in junior high you were the only one that hung out with that
Ukrainian kid?"
57,Monica," Yeah that, plus his mom used to put sour cream on everything!"
58,Ross, Ahh.
59,Monica, Do you love her?
60,Ross," We said it was only going to be two weeks, y’know?"
61,Monica, You love her!
62,Ross, What-what is love really?
63,Monica," Ohhh, I knew you loved her! Then you need to go to the airport
and tell her. You’re probably just gonna catch her just as she’s about to go to
the gate. You’re gonna call out her name and say, ""I love you!"" And
she’s gonna say, ""I love you, too!"" And you guys are going to have the most
amazing kiss, everyone at the gate will applaud."
64,Ross, I am a good kisser.
65,Monica," Then you two can, can sneak into the cockpit, and things will start to
heat up, and then a stewardess comes in… (Ross looks at her.) I’ve been watching
too much porn."
67,Rachel, Is that the heartbeat?
69,Phoebe, Oh my God!
70,Rachel, Oh wow! This is so cool.
73,Phoebe," Why don’t take care of this one, and should I get pregnant again,
I’ll hold onto your card, okay?"
75,Phoebe, Three? You guys were worried I wouldn’t even have one!
77,Phoebe," Well, yeah."
78,Rachel," Well, so, are-are you sure that there are three?!"
80,Phoebe," Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!! So I-I mean so in a few months
I’m going to have three full grown babies just walkin’ around inside me?! Oh!
Oh! And it’s gonna be one of those log rides where they just come shooting out!"
82,Phoebe, What do you know?!
85,Phoebe, Ooh! Hi!
87,Phoebe," Oh well, okay, hey, y’know how when you’re umm, you’re
walking down the street and you see three people in a row, and you say, ""Oh,
that’s nice?"""
89,Phoebe," Okay, yeah well, good news, you’re going to have three babies."
93,Phoebe," Oh God, I’m so glad you guys are happy, I was so afraid you were
going to be all freaked."
95,Phoebe," No, no maybe ‘cause it’s harder to raise them, and the added
expense, and…"
98,Phoebe," No, back to happy. Back to happy!"
102,Phoebe, No you can’t quit college! No! You’re in college? Really?
106,Phoebe, You can’t give up on your dream.
110,Ross, Emily! (Runs up.)
112,Ross," I just, I had to see you one more time before you took-off."
114,Ross," That’s, that’s, that’s a big candy bar. (She’s holding
one of those huge Toblerone bars.) I had the most amazing time with you."
118,Ross," (stops her) Wait uh, listen. I-I, I have to tell you something. Umm,
I’ve been thinking, I’m just gonna come out and say it. Okay? I-I-I ah, I-I
think I love you."
120,Ross, That’s no problem.
123,Rachel, What’s that song? It has been in my head all day long.
124,Chandler, It’s the theme from Good Will Humping.
125,Rachel," Y’know who doesn’t even like dirty movies? My new boyfriend
Joshua."
126,Joey, Yeah right.
127,Rachel," No, he told me. He prefers to leave certain things to the imagination."
128,Chandler," Oh-oh, yeah, and did he also say that ah, some of the dialogue was
corny and that he actually found it was funny and not sexy?"
129,Rachel, Yes!
130,Joey," Yeah, he likes porn."
132,Monica, Where ya going?
133,Rachel," I’m going to find out if he really thinks supermodels are too
skinny. (As she exits, Phoebe enters.) Hey, Pheebs!"
134,Phoebe, Hey.
135,Joey, Hey!
136,Monica, How did it go with Frank and Alice?
137,Phoebe," Well, Frank has to quit college because his super fertile sister is
having three babies! I need to make a lot of money really fast, and I had an idea that I
want to talk to you (Points to Chandler) about, ‘cause you work for a big company.
Okay, insider trading, what information is there that you can give me."
138,Chandler," They don’t really talk to us about that kind of stuff. I can get
you some free white out though."
140,Monica, Ohh! Did you do what I said? Did-did-did you tell her?
141,Ross, I did.
142,Monica," And well, what did she say?"
143,Ross, Thank you.
144,Monica," Oh, you’re totally welcome! What’d she say?"
145,Ross," She said, ""Thank you."" I said, ""I love you."" And she
said, ""Thank you."""
146,Chandler," Whoa-whoa, wait a minute, did you say, you love her?"
147,Joey," Yeah, what were you trying to get her to do?!"
148,Ross, What do I do now?
149,Joey, You play hard to get.
150,Ross, She already lives in London.
151,Joey, Then you go to Tokyo.
152,Chandler," All right look, forget it, forget it. You told her you love her,
it’s over."
153,Monica, It is not over! You’re over!
154,Chandler, What?
155,Monica, You know!
156,Chandler, Okay. (Pause) Good one.
157,Monica," It is not over because she is going to call you and tell you she loves
you. And the reason why she couldn’t, is because her feelings were so strong, it
scared her. Now you go home and wait for her call, she could be calling you from the
plane! Come on now go! Go! (Tries to push Ross out the door.)"
158,Ross," Okay! Okay! But if she doesn’t call, it is definitely over! No, wait.
Wait. Unless, eventually, I call her, y’know just to she what’s going on, and,
and she says she’ll call me back, but then she doesn’t. Then it’s
over."
160,Joey," Way to be strong, man!"
163,Rachel, Hey!
164,Chandler," Hi! Listen, can we watch cartoons on your television? We need a porn
break. We spent the last two hours watching In & Out & In, Again."
165,Rachel," Well, so, why don’t you just turn it off?"
166,Chandler, Because then we would be the guys who turned off free porn.
167,Phoebe," (entering carrying a case) Ooh, good, you’re hear! Okay."
168,Monica, Hey!
169,Phoebe, Hi!
170,Rachel," Well, what-what ‘cha got there?"
171,Phoebe," Oh this, well I’m glad you asked. (She opens the case and removes a
knife and an soda can.) Now, don’t you hate it when you have to cut a tin can with an
ordinary steak knife? (She efficiently cuts it in half.) Ahh! Now, I know what you’re
thinking…"
172,Chandler, Pregnant Woman Slays Four?
173,Monica," Phoebe, they didn’t make you pay for those knives, did they?"
174,Phoebe, No!
175,Monica, Are you sure?
176,Phoebe, No!
177,Rachel," Honey, you’re not gonna make enough money to help Frank and Alice
just by selling knives."
178,Phoebe," No-no, I know that, but I just have to make enough money for the second
part of my plan."
179,Chandler, What’s the second part of your plan?
180,Phoebe, My Saturn dealership.
182,Ross, (Answers the phone.) Hello?
184,Ross," Emily, hi! Uh, how-how was you flight?"
186,Ross," No, no, that-that, that’s all right. Umm, I’m just glad you
called."
188,Ross, Does that mean the same thing in England as it does in America?
190,Ross," She doesn’t know which one of us she wants, me or this Colin guy."
191,Monica," This isn’t how it’s supposed to go, there can’t be
another guy."
192,Ross, Well…
193,Monica," Of course there’s another guy!! This is even more perfect! Now you
have to prove your love!"
194,Ross," I’m not proving anything. Okay, I’m done listening to you. If I
hadn’t let you talk me into going to the airport in the first place, I never
would’ve put my fist through the wall!"
195,Chandler, You put your fist through the wall?
196,Ross," No, I missed and hit the door. But, it opened really hard!"
197,Monica, You have to go to London!
198,Ross, What?
199,Monica," Yeah, you have to go fight for her!"
200,Joey," Oh yeah, sure, that makes sense. Yeah. ‘Cause you already told her
you love her and she didn’t say it back, then she called you and told you that
there’s another guy, so yeah, go to London that’ll scare her!"
201,Monica," When Rachel was with Paulo, what did you do?"
202,Ross, I made fun of his accent.
203,Monica," You sat back and let him have her, you didn’t fight at all. Am I
right? Do you want the same thing to happen with Emily?"
204,Ross, No.
205,Monica," All right then, go fight for her! Go to London! I mean, that could be
you and Emily! (Points to the TV.) That, but-but nicer. Just, go to London!"
206,Ross, Really?
207,Monica," Come on! Surprise her! Show up at her doorstep! Don’t let her go
without a fight!"
208,Ross," All right. All right, I’m gonna do it! "
209,Monica, All right.
210,Ross," I’m gonna, I’m gonna go to London and I’m going to fight
for her."
211,Monica," Okay, good luck!"
213,Joey," Ross! Ross! If you’re going to the airport, could you pick me up
another one of those Toblerone bars? (Chandler nods his head no.)"
215,Rachel, Hey!
216,Phoebe," Ooh-Ooh! I did it! I did it! I figured out a way to make money! I’m
gonna open up my own massage place and Frank’s gonna help me! And! We can work it
around his schedule so he doesn’t have to quit school!"
217,Monica," That’s sounds great, but how are you going to afford it?"
218,Rachel," Well, we were walking down the street and we saw that van that you guys
used for catering and we realised…"
219,Phoebe, I’m telling it! I’m telling it!
220,Rachel, Okay.
221,Phoebe," Okay. You know how people need transportation, but they also need
massages to help them relax so I just figured we could combine the two, okay, I give the
massages and Frank drives! I can fix up the van, bolt the table in the back, and you know
what I’ve got?"
222,Chandler, A place where no one will ever get out alive?
223,Phoebe," No! Think about it, it’s a taxi that people take when they need to
relax, it’s…"
224,Rachel, (interrupting) Relaxi-Taxi!
225,Phoebe, The name was my favourite part!
226,Rachel," Well, well I can up with it!"
227,Phoebe," YOU DID NOT!!!! Oh! No! You came up with Relaxi Cab! That’s
not good."
228,Rachel," Well, I…"
230,Monica, Hello.
231,Ross, (on phone) Hey.
232,Monica," Oh my God! Ross, are you in England? Was Emily surprised?"
234,Ross," No, because she hasn’t come home yet. And she hasn’t been home
all night! She’s obviously staying with that other guy, and I’m the stupid moron
who spent the whole night outside her apartment!"
235,Monica," All right. When is, when is the next flight out?"
236,Ross, About four hours.
237,Monica," Okay, just stay there a couple more hours and if she doesn’t show
up by then, then just come on home."
238,Phoebe," Hey, tell him about Relaxi-Taxi, and-and ask him if he thinks
that’s better than Relaxi Cab."
239,Rachel," Okay, it’s not Relaxi Cab. It’s Relaxicab, like taxicab. "
240,Phoebe," Oh, that is better."
242,Chandler, Are we in London?
243,Monica, What are you doing here? You can’t be here!
247,Joey," (pause) Nothing. No, nothing."
249,Monica," Oh, you came to tell him you love him! I knew it! (Points at Chandler) I
was right! (Points to Emily) I’m right, right?"
251,Monica, Oh.
255,Ross," (yelling, thinking Emily can hear him through the answering machine all
the way to New York.) I love you too! I’m, I’m gonna call you right now from the
phone booth! (Realises) You can’t hear me. (Goes to make his call.)"
257,Ross, Hi.
259,Ross, Ohh! Thank you.
262,Chandler, Hey.
263,Joey, Hey.
264,Chandler," I was just at the bank, and there was this really hot teller, and she
didn’t ask me to go do it with her in the vault."
265,Joey," Same kind of thing happened to me! Woman pizza delivery guy come over,
gives me the pizza, takes the money, and leaves!"
266,Chandler," What, no, ""Nice apartment, I bet the bedrooms are huge?"""
267,Joey, Noo! Nothing!
268,Chandler," Y’know what, we have to turn off the porn."
269,Joey, I think you’re right.
271,Chandler," All right, ready?"
272,Joey, One.
273,Chandler, Two.
276,Joey, That’s kinda nice.
277,Chandler," Yeah, that’s kinda a relief."
278,Joey, Yeah.
280,Chandler, You wanna see if we still have it?
281,Joey, Yeah.
283,Chandler, FREE PORN!!!
284,Joey, Yeah!!
285,Chandler, We have free porn here!!!
0,Phoebe, Hey!
1,Chandler," Hey! Wow, it is true what they say, pregnant bellies look like
a drum."
2,Phoebe," (not amused) Ha-ha. (She sits down on the couch.) No, it’s just
I’m so pregnant that I—my guitar doesn’t fit anymore. So I thought
‘til I’m not, I’m just gonna play all my songs on this drum. It sounds really
cool!"
3,Chandler, All right.
4,Phoebe," Listen. Listen. (She starts to play and sing.) Smelly cat, smelly
cat, what are they feeding you? "
5,Joey," Wow, Pheebs! That sounds great!"
6,Phoebe," I know! I know, and I’ve only been playing for like an hour!"
8,Phoebe, Hey! What are you doing here?
10,Phoebe," Oh, well, don’t tell me you want to keep more of your stuff in my
uterus."
12,Chandler, Wouldn’t that be Frank the III?
14,Phoebe, Wow! That’s so great! Oh! Oh! Cougar.
19,Ross," Hey, if mommy can have a wife, daddy can have a bra."
21,Ross," Oh, no-no-no, see, that-that clock’s a little fast, uh, we have 17
minutes. Huh, what can we do in 17 minutes? Twice?"
24,Ross," Hey, uh, you can ignore that."
26,Ross," Uhh, believe me when he’s older, he’ll understand."
28,Ross," I’ll be right there. (He goes over and opens the door to Carol,
Susan, and Ben.) (To Ben.) Hello! (To Carol.) Hello! (To Susan.) Hey. Uhh, Emily, this is
Carol and Susan."
38,Ross," Look at you two, bonding, making us late for the airport so…"
41,Ross, Oh come on! That’s-that’s… true.
43,Phoebe, Hi!
44,Joey, Hey!
45,Chandler, Hey! Do we have a baby name yet?
46,Phoebe," Ugh! No! This is so hard! I went through this whole book (Holds up a
book) and found nothing! I want a name that’s really like, y’know strong and
confident, y’know? Like-like Exxon. "
47,Chandler," Well, it certainly worked for that Valdez kid."
48,Joey," Ooh-ooh, Pheebs, you want a strong name? How about, The Hulk?"
49,Phoebe," No, I’m-I’m not sure about Hulk, but I like the idea of a name
starting with ""The."""
50,Joey," Oh, want a good name, go with Joey. Joey’s your pal. Joey’s your
buddy. ""Where is everybody?"" ""Well, they’re hanging out with
Joey."""
51,Chandler," Hey, y’know what, if you’re gonna do that, if you’re
gonna name him Joey, you should name him Chandler. (Phoebe doesn’t think so.) Oh,
come on! Chandler’s funny, sophisticated, and he’s very loveable, once you get
to know him."
52,Joey," Oh well, hey, Joey’s loveable too! But the thing about Joey is, if
you need him, he’ll be there."
53,Chandler," Well, Chandler will be there for you too. I mean, well, he might be a
little late, but-but, he’ll be there. And he’ll bring you some cold soda, if
want you need him for is that you’re really hot."
54,Joey, What do ya say? What do ya say?
55,Phoebe," Well, I, I like the idea of naming him after someone I love, and Joey
and Chandler are great names. (They both stare at her.) But, all right, I
don’t—maybe I’ll just name him The Hulk."
56,Joey," I knew I shouldn’t have mentioned it! That’s what I wanted to
name my kid!"
58,Rachel," Hey, Mon, if you were hoping to sleep with Joshua the first time
tonight, which one of these would you want to be wearing. (She’s holding two frilly,
lace nighties.)"
59,Monica," Y’know what? It really creeps me out choosing other
people’s sex clothes."
60,Rachel," Sorry. I’m so exited! I’ve been waiting for this for months! I
got my hair coloured! I got new sheets! I’m making him a very fancy meal. "
61,Monica, Um-hmm.
62,Rachel, What am I making him by the way?
63,Monica," Well, you’re making him a frieze salad with goat cheese and pine
nuts, wild nuts, wild rice, roast asparagus, and salmon au croup."
64,Rachel, I thought I was making him filet mignon? 
65,Monica," Yeah, you were, but you decided to make salmon because you had some left
over at the restaurant. And then you realised if you (Points at Rachel) bitched about it,
then you (Points to herself) would stop cooking, and you (Points at Rachel) would have to
make your famous baked potato and Diet Coke."
66,Rachel," Wow, I really get crabby when I cook."
68,Ross, Hey!
69,Joey, Hey!
70,Chandler, Hey!
71,Ross," So uh, Emily called last night…"
72,Chandler, And now you’re giving me the message!
73,Ross," Turns out them Emily is just crazy about Susan. Yeah, they’re
going to the theatre together! They’re going to dinner! They’re going horseback
riding!"
74,Phoebe," God, Susan is so fun!"
75,Ross," Look, this is just a little too familiar, okay? For like, for like six
months before Carol and I spilt up, all I heard was ""My friend Susan is so smart. My
friend Susan is so funny. My friend Susan is so great."""
76,Chandler, You actually think that something can happen between Emily and Susan?
77,Ross," Hey, they’re going to the gym together! Two women! Stretching!
Y’know they-they take a steam together! Things get a little playful—didn’t
you see Personal Best?"
78,Joey," No, but I’m gonna!"
79,Chandler, Hi! Hi! You’re crazy! Okay? This is Emily. Emily is straight.
80,Ross," How do you know? I mean we thought Carol was straight before I married
her!"
81,Phoebe," Yeah, I definitely. I don’t like the name Ross."
82,Ross, What a weird way to kick me when I’m down.
83,Phoebe, No! No! I-I meant for the baby!
84,Ross, Oh. What’s wrong with Ross?
85,Phoebe," Well, it’s just y’know that something like this would never to
like The Hulk, y’know…"
86,Ross," Actually that-that’s not true, in The Incredible Hulk uh, No.
72, Dr. Bruce Banner found… (Sees everyone staring at him and stops.) Y’know,
ugh, nevermind, my girlfriend’s a lesbian. (Leaves.)"
87,Phoebe," So, I decided I’m definitely going to go with either Joey or
Chandler."
88,Joey," Oh! Oh-oh, you gotta pick Joey! I mean, name one famous person named
Chandler."
89,Chandler, Raymond Chandler.
90,Joey, Someone you didn’t make up!
91,Chandler," Okay, there are no famous Joey’s. Except for, huh, Joey
Buttafucco."
92,Joey," Yeah, that guy really hurt us."
93,Phoebe," Well, how about a compromise then, okay? What if it’s like
y’know, Chanoey?"
94,Chandler," Okay, look, Joey! Come on, think about it, first of all, he’ll
never be President. There’s never gonna be a President Joey."
95,Joey," All right look man, I didn’t want to bring this up, but Chandler, is
the stupidest name I ever heard in my life! It’s not even a name; it’s barely
even a word. Okay? It’s kinda like chandelier, but it’s not! All right?
It’s a stupid, stupid non-name!"
96,Chandler," Wow, you’re, you’re right. I have a horrible, horrible name."
97,Joey," I’m sorry man, I didn’t—I’m-I’m sorry. I’m
sorry. (Goes over and comforts him.) "
98,Chandler, Okay.
99,Joey, So I guess it’s Joey then!
102,Rachel," Ohh, please! Cooking soothes me. (They kiss.) Ahh. So, dig in!"
104,Rachel, (taking a bite) Hmmm!
106,Rachel," Oh I know, my God, this is so—this rice is so—I am so good."
108,Rachel," (sees the chick and the duck) Oh, yeah, I’m sorry. They used to
live here; sometimes they migrate back over."
110,Rachel," Yeah, sure, okay. Okay."
112,Joey," (answering the door.) Hey, how did you do that?! Come on in. (He brings
them inside.)"
114,Rachel," All gone! So, farm birds, huh?"
116,Rachel, Oh.
119,Rachel," Okay. So, can I serve you a little of—What? What? What? (She sees
that Joshua isn’t relaxed.)"
121,Rachel," But, they’re across the hall! I mean that’s two doors away, it
would take them a long time to peck their way back over here."
123,Rachel," Okay, y’know, would you feel better if we went someplace else? I
mean we could pack all this stuff up and y’know go to your apartment."
125,Rachel, Your parents’?
127,Rachel, Ohh.
129,Rachel, Yeah that works.
133,Ross, (opening the door.) Hey!
135,Ross," Well, I asked him if he wanted to eat, he said, ""No."" I asked
him if he wanted to sleep, he said, ""No."" I asked him what he wanted to do, he
said, ""No."" So, he’s sweeping. (We see Ben playing with a broom and a
dustpan.)"
137,Ross," So umm, any word from Susan?"
139,Ross," Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh, by the by, did it uh, did it ever occur to you that, I
don’t know, maybe they might be having a little too much fun?"
141,Ross," Y’know, the kind of fun, you and Susan had when we were married."
143,Ross, Am I?!
145,Ross, Am I?!
147,Ross," Uh-huh, Carol, so were we. All right, just-just imagine for a moment,
Susan meets someone and-and they really hit it off. Y’know? Say-say they’re
coming back from the theatre, and they-they stop at a pub for a couple of drinks,
they’re laughing, y’know, someone innocently touches someone else…
There’s electricity, it’s new. It’s exciting. Are you telling me there
isn’t even the slightest possibility of something happening?"
149,Ross, OH MY GOD!! I didn’t really believe it until you just said it!!
152,Rachel, Wow! This place is fabulous!
154,Rachel," Whoa-whoa, there’s two living rooms? God, growing up here, this
place must’ve been a real babe magnet."
156,Rachel," Ohh, you should know, this place is a real babe magnet. Wanna make out?"
159,Rachel," That sounds like a plan. Umm, is there a place I can go freshen up?"
161,Rachel, Ah.
173,Rachel, Hi you!
175,Rachel," I know, I can do more than cook."
181,Rachel," Ohh! It’s so nice to meet you. (She goes over and shakes their
hands.) Hello. "
183,Rachel, Hello.
185,Rachel," What? This-this, no, oh no, no-no-no, this is
not—that’s-that’s not what it is. See, see, okay, I work in fashion, see
and-and, this is a real dress actually. It’s-it’s, they’re-they’re
wearing it in Milan, so part of my job is too wear the clothes, and then I see how people
respond, and then I report back to my superiors at Bloomingdale’s, so…
And obviously in uh, in-in this case, (She grabs a pen and paper) I am going to report
back, ""USA not ready."""
187,Rachel, Yes!
190,Rachel," Well, we were going to do that after—I mean umm, next."
192,Rachel," Oh, yeah, well… Yeah, no use wasting this baby, just lyin’
around the house. "
194,Rachel, Yes.
197,Joey," Dude, I am sorry about what I said!"
198,Chandler," No, no, you’re right, it is a ridiculous name!"
199,Joey, It’s not that bad.
200,Chandler," Yes it is! From now on, I have no first name."
201,Joey," So, you’re just Bing?"
202,Chandler, I have no name.
203,Phoebe," All right, so, what are we supposed to call you?"
204,Chandler," Okay uh, for now, temporarily, you can call me, Clint."
205,Joey, No way are you cool enough to pull of Clint.
206,Chandler," Okay, so what name am I cool enough to pull off?"
207,Phoebe," Umm, Gene."
208,Chandler, It’s Clint. It’s Clint! (He heads for his bedroom.)
209,Joey," See you later, Gene."
210,Phoebe," Bye, Gene."
211,Chandler, It’s Clint! Clint!
212,Joey, What’s up with Gene?
214,Monica," So, you wore your nightie to dinner?"
215,Rachel," Oh, yeah. And uh, the best part though, when the uh, waiter spilled
water down my back, I jumped up, and my boob popped out."
216,Phoebe, Oh my God!
217,Monica," Oh, no!"
218,Rachel," No, it’s all right. I got nice boobs. (Phoebe and Monica nod there
heads in agreement.)"
219,Ross," (returning from the phone.) So, I just picked up a message from Emily, she
and Susan are going to a poetry reading together! "
220,Rachel, So?
221,Ross, So! Poetry? Susan’s gay! They’re being gay together!
222,Monica, Emily’s straight.
223,Ross," Oh, wake up!"
224,Phoebe," Wow, Carol really messed you up!"
225,Ross, Excuse me?
226,Phoebe," Yeah, she turned you into this-this-this untrusting, crazy, jealous,
sycophant. (They all look at her.) All right, so I don’t know what sycophant means,
but the rest is right."
227,Ross," Look, I don’t know what you’re talking about, I am not a crazy,
jealous person."
228,Rachel, Huh.
229,Ross, What?
230,Rachel," She’s totally right! When we were together, you got all freaked out
about Mark and there was nothing going on."
231,Monica, This totally makes sense!
232,Ross, It does not!
233,Monica," Oh, sure it does! In high school, you weren’t jealous at all even
though all your girlfriends were cheating on you!"
234,Phoebe," All right, all right, so up until ‘92-93 he was very trusting, then
’94 hit, Carol left him and bamn! Paranoid city!"
235,Rachel, Absolutely! Absolutely!
236,Monica, This is so much fun!
237,Ross, This is not fun!
238,Monica," Look, all we’re trying to say is, don’t let what happened with
Carol ruin what you got with Emily."
239,Phoebe, Yeah. The ’92 Ross wouldn’t.
240,Ross," Well, I still think I was right about that whole Mark thing."
241,Rachel," What—yeah—what, y’know what? I hope Emily is a
lesbian."
243,Phoebe, Drum roll.
244,Chandler," (entering) Okay. Okay. All right. Help! Am I a Mark, or a John?"
245,Joey," Nah, you’re not tall enough to be a Mark, but you might make a good
Barney."
246,Chandler," All right look, am I serious, okay? Tomorrow at 330 I am going down
to the courthouse."
247,Phoebe, You’re actually going through with this?
248,Chandler," Hey, look, this name has been holding me back my entire life. Okay,
it’s probably why kids picked on me in school, and why I never do well with
women… So, as of 4 o’clock tomorrow, I’m either gonna be Mark Johnson or
John Markson."
249,Phoebe," You got problems because of you! Not your name! All right, this has got
to stop! Chandler is a great name! In fact—yes, (To Joey) I’m, I’m sorry. I
know you really wanted me to name the baby Joey, but eh, so, I’m-I’m, I’m
gonna, I’m gonna name the baby Chandler."
250,Chandler, (pleased) Really?!
251,Phoebe," Yeah, but you have to keep the name too!"
252,Chandler, Okay. Thanks.
253,Phoebe, Okay!
254,Chandler, You wanna hug it out?
255,Phoebe, Yeah!
257,Phoebe, Yay! 
258,Chandler, Yay! 
259,Phoebe," Yay—oh—yay! Okay, I gotta go tell Frank and Alice! Right now!"
260,Chandler, Okay!
261,Phoebe," Ooh, uh… (She grabs her coat and runs out.)"
262,Chandler," Bye, Pheebs!"
263,Phoebe," Okay, bye! "
265,Chandler, Ha! Ha! Ha!
266,Joey," Ohh! (Realises it was all a trick to get Phoebe to name the baby
Chandler.)"
269,Ross, Nice luggage.
274,Ross, Hi!
276,Ross," Oh, I missed you too."
280,Ross, (To Carol) No tongue. (And gives her the thumbs up.)
1,Rachel, HEY!! Do you have to do that? It’s Saturday!
4,Rachel," I hate this apartment! I hate the color of these walls! I hate
the fact that this place still smells like bird! I hate that singing guy!"
5,Joey," Are you kidding? I love that guy! (Starts singing) Morning’s here!
Morning is here—"
6,Rachel, Stop it! I will kill you. I hate the fact that my room is so small.
7,Monica," Hey, I have all the space I need. Just do what I did."
8,Rachel," Monica, you don’t even have a bed, you sleep in a ball on the
floor!"
9,Monica," Y’know what? I am really tired of your bellyaching! Okay,
I-I worked really hard at making this a nice place for us to live!"
10,Rachel, I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.
11,Monica, Okay.
12,Joey," See, this is a great apartment."
13,Monica, Shut up! This place is a hole!
18,Ross," Huh? I know, I know. Who am I? David Bowe? (Shakes his head around,
pretending like he’s jamming.)"
20,Ross," Uh, I don’t know, whatever."
22,Ross," Oh, I know. Y’know what, I never would’ve gotten this if it
weren’t for you. No really, when I’m with you I’m-I’m like this whole
other guy, I love that guy! I mean, I love you too, a lot, but that guy! I-I love
that guy!"
24,Ross, Yeah?
27,Ross," Then don’t. Stay here. Just don’t go so soon to London, just one
more day."
29,Ross," One more day, seriously/"
31,Ross," So, then you can stay as long as you want."
33,Ross," Oh no. Don’t, don’t, don’t start packing. Come on! (She
puts some clothes into her bag, and Ross throws them out.)"
35,Ross," Yeah, I know, I uh, I tried them on."
37,Ross," No. No, I didn’t. I didn’t want to be that guy."
39,Phoebe," (entering, wearing Santa pants) Hello!"
40,Chandler, Ho! Ho! Ho!
41,Phoebe, Excuse me.
42,Chandler, Your pants!
43,Phoebe," Oh, yeah! You like ‘em? I just, I went to a used clothes store and
got a bunch of maternity stuff. These are sooo comfortable!"
44,Joey," Uhh, Pheebs, those are uh, those are Santa pants."
45,Phoebe, What?
46,Chandler," Santa pants. (Phoebe still doesn’t get it.) Santa Claus’s
pants."
47,Phoebe," Nuh-uh! They’re maternity pants. They even came with a list of baby
names. (Pulls out a sheet of paper which lists who’s been naughty and who’s been
nice.) See, these names are good, and these names are bad. (Finally, she figures it out.)
Ohh."
48,Rachel, (entering) Hey!
49,Monica, (entering) Hey!
50,Rachel," So—Hey, Pheebs! So, how are the elves?"
51,Phoebe," I don’t know! How are the-the-the-the, y’know—You’re
clothes aren’t funny."
52,Monica," Hey, guys, what-what should I wear to a Knicks game?"
53,Chandler," Uhh, a T-shirt that says, ""I don’t belong here."""
54,Joey, You have Knicks tickets?
55,Rachel," Yeah, my mom got my dad’s season tickets in the divorce, so she
just gave them to me."
56,Monica," Yeah, apparently, they’re pretty good seats."
57,Rachel, Yeah.
58,Joey, (examining the tickets) Oh my God! Those are almost right on the floor!
59,Rachel, Do you guys want these?
60,Joey,
61,Chandler, Yeah we do!
62,Rachel," Ohh, well you got ‘em."
64,Rachel, Just give us our apartment back!
65,Phoebe, Boy! I didn’t see that coming!
66,Chandler, Are you serious?
67,Rachel," Oh, come on! We know what these are worth."
68,Monica," Yeah, what, do you think we’re stupid?"
69,Joey, You’re not stupid. You’re meaner than I thought.
70,Monica, What do you say?
71,Chandler," Forget it! Okay, I’m not giving up my bachelor pad for some
basketball seats!"
72,Rachel, You’re bachelor pad?!
73,Monica, Have you even had a girl up here?
74,Chandler," No. But uh, Joey has, and I usually talk to them in the morning time."
75,Joey," Yeah, you do!"
77,Joey, Come on!
78,Chandler," (ignoring him) Yes, Gunther, can I get two cups of chino, please?"
80,Joey," Come on, season tickets! Season tickets, do you know what that means?"
81,Chandler," Forget it! Okay, I’m not giving up the apartment."
82,Joey," Oh come—look, when I was a kid my dad’s company gave season
tickets to the number one salesman every year, all right? My dad never won! Of
course, he wasn’t in the sales division, but still, I never ever, ever forgot that!"
83,Ross," (entering) Hey, guys! (They both notice his new little friend)"
84,Joey, Hey!
85,Chandler, Oh my God!
86,Joey, We don’t make enough fun of you already?
87,Ross," Oh yeah, Emily convinced me to do it."
88,Chandler, You do know that Wham broke up?
89,Ross," I like it, and Emily likes it, and that’s what counts. So uh, how are
you guys doing?"
90,Joey," Oh-no, don’t try and talk all normal with that thing in your ear."
91,Chandler, Where is Emily?
92,Ross," Ugh, she’s saying good-bye to her uncle."
93,Chandler," Man, didn’t she like just get here?"
94,Ross, Yeah!! Yeah!
95,Chandler, Easy tiger.
96,Ross," I just, I hate this so much! I mean, every time I go pick her up at the
airport, it’s-it’s so great. But at the same time I’m thinking, ""Well,
I’m gonna be right back there in a couple of days, dropping her off."""
97,Chandler, So what are you going to do?
98,Ross," Nothing! There’s nothing to do! I mean, she lives there, I live here.
I mean, she-she’d have to uh, move here. She should move here!"
99,Joey, What?
100,Ross, I could ask her to live with me!
101,Chandler, Are you serious?
102,Ross," I mean, why not! I mean, I mean why not?!"
103,Chandler," Because you’ve only known her for six weeks! Okay, I’ve got
a carton of milk in my fridge I’ve had a longer relationship with!"
104,Ross," Look guys, when I’m with her it’s-it’s-it’s like she
brings this-this-this great side out of me. I mean I-I-I love her, y’know?"
105,Chandler," And I love the milk! But, I’m not gonna some British girl to move
in with me! (Realizes that made no sense.) Joey, you say things now."
106,Joey," All right look, Ross, he’s right. Emily’s great, she’s
great! But this way too soon, you’re only gonna scare her!"
107,Ross, I don’t want to do that.
108,Joey," No! You don’t want to wreck it, you don’t want to go to fast!"
109,Ross," Yeah, no, you’re right, I know, you’re right, I’m not,
I’m not gonna do it. All right, thanks guys. (Gets up to leave.)"
110,Chandler," Okay, no problem, just remember to wake us up before you go-go."
112,Phoebe, That’s too hard. Too hard!
113,Monica," (entering with Rachel) All right boys, last chance for the tickets!"
114,Rachel," Or I’ll give them to my new boyfriend, Joshua."
115,Chandler, No thank you.
116,Joey," Wait-wait-wait-wait! (To Chandler) Come on! Come on, let’s trade! The
timing’s perfect, I just clogged the toilet! "
117,Chandler," Look, I want those basketball seats as much as you do! Okay, but we
can’t leave in the small apartment after we’ve lived here! Didn’t you ever
read Flowers for Algernon?"
118,Joey," Yes! Didn’t you ever read Sports Illustrated?! No! I
didn’t read yours! But come on, we can go to the game tonight!"
119,Chandler," Look, the only way I will even consider this is if they offer a lot
more than just season seats."
120,Joey, It’s the Knicks!
121,Chandler, Screw the Knicks!
122,Joey, Whoa!
123,Chandler," I didn’t mean that. I just meant that the apartment is worth so
much more."
124,Joey, Huh.
125,Chandler, And the Knicks rule all.
126,Joey," Yeah, the Knicks rule all!"
127,Phoebe," Hey, so? Are you gonna do it?"
128,Chandler," No. No. We’re not gonna do that, y’know why? Because its not
an even trade."
129,Rachel," All right, okay, look, what if you could keep the apartment and get the
tickets?"
130,Joey, Done!
131,Rachel, Let me finish. 
132,Joey, Oh. 
133,Rachel," I’m talking about a bet, winner takes all."
134,Joey," Ooh, we could end up with nothing."
135,Phoebe, Or you could end up with everything.
136,Joey," Ooh, I like that."
137,Monica," All right, so what do you say?"
138,Chandler, No!
139,Monica," Oh, just do it!!"
140,Chandler," Op, op, I’m convinced!"
141,Joey," Come on man, you know I’d do it for you! Because, you’re my best
friend."
142,Chandler," All right, but you can’t use that again for a whole year.
I’m in."
143,Joey, All right!
144,Phoebe," Ooh, this is so exciting! Ooh, God, what are you going to bet?"
145,Rachel," Oh, okay, well, I think we should let Phoebe decide, because she’s
the only who’s impartial, and she’s so pretty."
146,Phoebe," Okay. Umm, ooh, ooh—oh, I have a game!"
147,Joey, Okay! 
148,Chandler, Okay!
149,Phoebe, This is great!
150,Joey, What’s the game?! What’s the game?!
151,Phoebe," Oh, well, it doesn’t have a name—oh, okay, Phoebeball! No, it
doesn’t have a name. Umm, okay, Monica, what is your favourite thing about trees?"
152,Monica, They’re green?
153,Phoebe, Good! Good! Five points!
155,Phoebe," All right, Joey, same question."
157,Joey," Uhh, they’re tall."
158,Phoebe," Ooh, three points. Both fine answers, but we were looking for leafy,
leafy."
160,Monica, That’s not even a game!
161,Rachel, What? Shut up! We’re winning!
162,Monica," You wanna finish this right now? All right, we get a deck of cards, high
card wins. What do you say?"
163,Chandler," Fine, let’s do it."
164,Phoebe," Oh, I have cards!"
165,Joey, Oh.
166,Monica," Oh, good."
167,Phoebe," Yeah! Here! (She grabs a deck out of her purse) Oh no, these are the
trick deck. Okay. Here yes. Okay."
168,Chandler," Okay, you guys uh, you guys pick first"
169,Rachel, Okay.
170,Monica, Okay. (She picks a card.) Four.
171,Chandler, That’s a low one!
172,Joey," Yeah! Okay. (Joey picks a card.) Phoebe, you look, I can’t."
173,Phoebe, What make you think I can?! (Shields her eyes from it.)
174,Joey, Okay. Okay. (He looks at the card.) Ace!
176,Chandler, Why are you screaming and hugging?
177,Monica, Because we won our apartment back!
178,Joey," What? Ace is high! Jack, queen, king, ace!"
179,Monica," No! Ace is low! Ace, two, three, four!"
181,Phoebe," I don’t know. Ooh! Ooh! Look it! (She fans out the trick deck.)
Ah-ha!"
182,Rachel," All right, cut, let’s pick again, pick again."
183,Joey, Okay.
184,Rachel," Come on apartment! Come on apartment! (Picks a card.) Oh! I know queen
is high!"
185,Joey," Uh-huh, not as high as…(picks a card) It worked! King!"
186,Chandler, Yeah baby!
187,Monica," But, we pick again! We pick again!"
188,Joey, Why?!
189,Monica, I don’t know!
190,Chandler," Tickets please! (Rachel hands over the tickets) That’s courtside
baby!"
191,Joey," Seriously, good game though. Good game. (He tries to congratulate them,
but they pull away.) (To Chandler) What are they so mad about? They get the apartment
back!"
192,Chandler, No they didn’t!
194,Ross, Hey!
196,Ross, (laughs) Move in with me.
198,Ross," Don’t be scared, I-I know it sounds crazy and-and people will say
it’s too soon, but just-just think, think how great it will be."
200,Ross, I know.
202,Ross," Well, so, you-you’ll get a job here! I mean, I’m always hearing
about uh, them foreigners coming in here and stealing American jobs; that could be you!"
204,Ross," No, I can’t. I would, I really would, but my son is here; I
can’t leave him. Isn’t—you don’t think there’s any way?"
206,Ross, What?
208,Ross," No, no, don’t. Why don’t we?"
210,Ross, Get married.
212,Ross," No! No! I’m not! It’s-it’s-it’s perfect! I mean
it’s better than you just-just moving here, ‘cause it’s us together
forever, and that’s-that’s what I want."
214,Ross," Yeah, I know, so what? I mean, who’s-who’s to say? Does that me
we-we can’t do it? Look, huh, I was with Carol for four years before we got married
and I wound up divorced from a pregnant lesbian. I mean, this, this makes sense for us.
Come on! I mean, on our first date we ended up spending the whole weekend in Vermont! I
mean, last night I got my ear pierced! Me! This feels right. Doesn’t it?"
216,Ross, Is that—are you saying yes? Is that yes?
220,Ross, Yes! We’re getting married?!
222,Ross, Yes!
224,Ross," Come here, come here. Uh, (He takes the earring out.) ow! Emily, will you
marry me?"
228,Ross, Damn! I thought that was going to be romantic as hell!
233,Chandler, Those were like the best seats ever.
234,Joey," Oh yeah. Hey! Should we give these shirts to the girls? Y’know, kinda
like a peace offering."
235,Chandler," Oh yeah, that’s very nice. Plus, y’know they were free and
they’re too small."
237,Chandler," Oh. Oh, God! (He starts running around like a chicken with his head
cut off.)"
238,Joey," Hey, want a beer? (Hands him a beer and sits down in one of the chairs.)
(Jumping up.) WHOA!!!!"
239,Chandler, I KNOW!!!
241,Chandler, Open up! Open up! Open up!
243,Monica," We’ll discuss it, in the morning! (Slams the door shut.)"
244,Chandler, What the hell is going on?!
246,Rachel, We took our apartment back!! (Slams the door shut.)
247,Phoebe," (opening the door) I had nothing to do with it. (Closes the door.)
(Opens the door.) Okay, it was my idea, but I don’t feel good about it."
249,Chandler," We are switching back, right now!"
250,Monica," No, we’re not! We’re not leaving!"
251,Chandler," Well, you’re gonna have to leave sometime, because you both have
jobs, and as soon as you do, we’re switching it back! There’s nothing you can do
to stop us! Right, Joe?"
252,Joey, I don’t know.
253,Chandler, What?
254,Joey, I don’t want to move again! 
255,Chandler," I don’t care, this is our apartment! And they stole—you
stole it—our apartment, and we won that apartment fair and square, twice! And I am
getting it back right now. I’m getting back right now!"
257,Rachel," All right. We figured you might respond this way, so we have a backup
offer."
258,Chandler," Oh no-no-no, no more offers. You can’t offer anything to us!"
259,Rachel, Let us keep the apartment and…
260,Monica," As a thank you, Rachel and I will kiss for one minute."
262,Chandler, Totally worth it!
263,Joey, That was one good minute!
264,Chandler, Good night.
265,Joey, Good night.
268,Monica, Men are such idiots.
269,Rachel," Yeah! Can you believe that something that stupid actually got us our
apartment back?"
270,Phoebe," That’s so funny to think if you’d just done that right after
the last contest, no one would have had to move at all."
271,Monica," Yeah, let-let-let’s pretend that’s not true."
272,Rachel, Yeah.
273,Phoebe," Okay, scarf’s done. (It’s not really a scarf, it’s just a
bunch of yarn that Phoebe has tied together. Just then, Ross and Emily enter dragging with
them Joey and Chandler.)"
274,Ross, Come on! Come on. Come on.
275,Chandler, Okay!
276,Phoebe, Hey!
277,Ross, Hey!
278,Monica, What-what’s going on?
279,Joey, Ross has some big thing to tell everyone.
280,Ross," Uhh, okay, it’s uh, Emily and I, we decided to uh, to get married."
282,Phoebe," What? Oh, are you pregnant too?!"
284,Monica," When, when did—how, how did you…"
285,Ross," We, we just decided to uh, to go for it."
288,Ross," (turning around.) Umm, uh, I was just telling the guys…"
289,Rachel," Yeah, I-I heard. (Pause, everyone looks at each other, waiting for
Rachel’s reaction.) I think it’s great! (Hugs Ross.) Ohh, I’m so happy for
you!"
291,Chandler," Oh, well, that’s great!"
292,Joey, Yeah! Yeah!
293,Monica, (to Ross) I can’t believe you’re getting married! 
294,Ross, Yeah. (They hug again.)
295,Joey," Monica and Rachel made out. (Giggles like a schoolboy and Monica glares at
him.)"
302,Joey, Hey! (Singing) Get into gear!
306,Joey, (happily) Okay!
0,Chandler," Are you kidding me?! Joey. Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey!
Joey! Joey!!"
1,Joey," (joining in, in his sleep) Joey. Joey. Joey. Joey! Joey!!"
3,Chandler," Oh. Oh, did-did-did I wake you?"
6,Chandler," Gunther, can I get another cup of coffee, please? (Gunther starts to
pour him another cup.) So uh, what do you do when you’re not working here?"
8,Chandler," Oh, okay, thanks. (He goes back to the couch and rejoins Monica, Joey,
and Phoebe.)"
9,Monica," Chandler, that’s like your fourth cup of coffee!"
10,Chandler," Well, I am drinking lots of cups of coffee because I’m exhausted!
Because Joey started snoring!"
11,Monica, He’s in a different room! He’s really that loud?
12,Joey," (proudly) Oh, you should here me."
13,Chandler," It’s not something to be proud of, okay? You have to go to a
sleep clinic!"
14,Joey," Look, I told ya, I’m not going to any clinic! I don’t have a
problem, you’re the one with the problem! You should go to a ""Quit being a baby
and leave me alone"" clinic!"
15,Chandler, They don’t have those.
16,Joey," Yeah, they do! Quit being a baby and leave me alone! There, you’ve
just had your first class!"
17,Monica," Y’know I used to go out with this guy that was a really light
sleeper, and whenever I started to snore, he would just roll me over…"
18,Joey," Ohhh, yeah!"
19,Monica, He would just roll me over and I would stop snoring.
20,Chandler," Next time you snore, I’m rolling ya over!"
21,Joey," I gotta do what I gotta do, you gotta do what you gotta do, you just do
it."
22,Ross, (entering) Hey guys!
23,Chandler," Hey, all right!"
24,Phoebe, Hey!
26,Phoebe," Oh, the Olympics."
27,Monica, Have you guys picked a date yet?
28,Ross," Oh no, not yet."
29,Phoebe," I still cannot believe you’re engaged! (Ross looks at her)
Just ‘cause its happening so fast; not ‘cause you’re such a loser. "
30,Ross," Oh. Thanks. Uh, has anyone seen Rach?"
31,Monica," Ugh, she’s upstairs not doing the dishes! And I tell ya
something! I’m not doing them this time! I don’t care if those dishes sit in the
sink until they’re all covered with—I’ll do them when I get home!"
32,Ross," Yeah—oh! Hey listen umm, Emily found this wedding dress in
London…"
33,Phoebe, Already?!
34,Ross," Yeah, but it didn’t fit. Well, luckily there’s a store here that
has one left in her size, but I’m the groom, I’m not supposed to see the
dress… "
35,Monica, I’ll pick it up for you!
36,Ross, Thank you.
37,Monica, Okay.
38,Chandler," Oh, she’s got you running errands, y’know, picking up
wedding dresses… (Laughs and makes like Indiana Jones and his whip) Wah-pah!"
39,Ross, What’s wah-pah?
40,Chandler," Y’know, whipped! Wah-pah!"
41,Joey, That’s not whipped! Whipped is wh-tcssh!
42,Chandler, That’s what I did. Wah-pah!
43,Joey, You can’t do anything!
45,Rachel," Hey, Mon, I was just doing the dishes! "
46,Ross, Hey!
47,Rachel, Oh! It’s you. (She stops doing the dishes.) Hi.
48,Ross," Hey, do uh, do you have a minute?"
49,Rachel," Yeah, yeah, I was just about to take a break anyways, so…"
50,Ross," So listen uh, I know you and I haven’t really had a chance to talk
since uh, Emily and I decided to get married, and uh, I was just wondering how you were."
51,Rachel, Oh.
52,Ross," I know if you were getting married I’d feel, kinda…..
y’know."
53,Rachel," Yeah. Yeah. Definitely, well it definitely took me by surprise, but
I’m okay."
54,Ross, Yeah?
55,Rachel, Yeah.
56,Ross," All right, I just wanted to check."
57,Rachel," Oh, that’s sweet."
59,Ross," You’re great. And I-I know someday this will happen for you too. You
just hang in there."
60,Rachel," (breaking the hug) Uhh, hang in there?"
61,Ross," Oh, no, I didn’t mean, uh…"
62,Rachel," I mean maybe you didn’t hear about a serious relationship called me
and Joshua?"
63,Ross," Oh, I thought you guys had just been on like four dates, I didn’t
realise that had become anything, yet."
64,Rachel," Oh, no-no-no, no-no-no, it has become, it has—yeah. Oh no, those
were four great dates. "
65,Ross, Oh. Yeah?
66,Rachel," Yeah. Oh, yeah. And I mean, the connection, I mean y’know,
emotionally, mentally, physically…"
67,Ross," Wow, that’s-that’s-that’s incredible."
68,Rachel, I know isn’t it? It’s like I’m right there with Joshua.
69,Ross, Uh-huh.
70,Rachel," You are right there with Emily. And it’s y’know, it’s
kinda like…. it’s a tie! Well, I gotta get, I gotta get back to the dishes."
71,Ross, I gotta get to work.
72,Rachel, Oh yeah? Fine.
73,Ross," Hey, y’know, y’know what would make me really happy?"
74,Rachel," Oh yeah, no, what’s that?"
75,Ross," If like the four of us could all y’know, hang out together. Uh, in
fact Emily’s coming into town this weekend, why don’t you say we all have
dinner? Say, Sunday night?"
76,Rachel, That would be great!
77,Ross," Yeah, all right, it’s a date. (He leaves)"
78,Rachel," (to the closed door) Hang in there. You hang in there. (Gives him the
raspberry.) "
79,Ross, (coming back in) Did you say something?
80,Rachel," No, just singing. (Does a little song.)"
82,Monica, Oh my God! Ohh! Look at this one! It’s so beautiful!
83,Phoebe," Yeah, but y’know, about have of these are gonna end up getting
divorced."
85,Monica," Oh, yes, umm, I’m here to pick up a dress that you have on hold."
87,Monica, Emily Waltham.
89,Monica, (laughs) Okay.
91,Phoebe, You’re the most beautiful bride I’ve ever seen.
92,Monica," I am, aren’t I?"
94,Monica, Yes?
96,Monica, All right. (Goes to take off the dress.)
100,Chandler," All right buddy, time to roll over. (Rolls him over, and discovers a
surprise) (Looking down) No-no! (Covers his eyes) No, no-n-n-n-no!! You are going to a
clinic! You’re going to a clinic, and a pyjama store!"
102,Monica," Does she use the cups? Yes! I believe she does. Does she use the plates?
Yes! I believe she does. (Looks at the wedding dress and stops.)"
104,Monica," Oh. Thank you. Ohhh, thank you very much. Oh, thank you for coming.
(There’s a knock on the door.) Uh, just a second!"
105,Phoebe," No-no, let me in!"
106,Monica, Phoebe?
107,Phoebe, Yeah!
108,Monica, Can you just hold on for one minute?
109,Phoebe," No, you have to let me in right now!!"
110,Monica, Are you alone?
111,Phoebe, Yes!
112,Monica, All right.
115,Joey," This sucks! I didn’t know I had to stay up all night before I went to
this stupid sleep clinic! I’m so tired!"
116,Chandler, It’s 600.
117,Joey," Yeah, well…"
118,Rachel, (entering) Hi!
119,Chandler," Hey, I hear that you and Joshua are going out to dinner with Ross and
Emily, and I think that’s, I think that’s really cool."
120,Joey," Yeah, Rach, I think you’re handling that really well."
121,Rachel," Handling it? What do you mean, handling it? There’s nothing to
handle. Now, maybe I would have a problem with this if it wasn’t for me and Joshua.
Y’know, they’re not gonna get married anyway!"
122,Chandler, What?
123,Rachel," Come on! They rushed into this thing so fast it’s ridiculous! I
mean, they’re gonna be engaged for like what? A year? And somewhere along the way,
one of them is gonna realise what they’ve done and they’re call the whole thing
off. I’m telling ya, you’re gonna be dancing at my wedding before you’re
dancing at there’s."
124,Chandler," Yeah, well, I don’t dance at weddings."
125,Rachel, Why not?
126,Chandler," Because weddings are a great place to meet women, and when I dance, I
look like this… (Starts to dancing really, really, really badly. Ross enters behind
him and he stops.)"
127,Ross, Hey man.
128,Chandler, Hey!
129,Ross," So, what are you guys doing four weeks from today?"
130,Chandler, Nothing.
131,Rachel, Nothing.
132,Joey, I am… (Looks in his date book.) free!
133,Ross, Great! Because Emily and I are getting married in a month!
135,Ross, Yep!
136,Rachel, In a month?
137,Ross, Yeah!
138,Rachel," You mean, you mean 30 days?"
139,Ross, Yeah.
140,Rachel, From now? 
141,Ross, Yeah.
142,Rachel," Well, that’s great."
143,Ross," Yeah! Yeah, Emily always wanted to get married in this beautiful place
that her parents got married, but it’s going to be torn down, so… I mean, I-I
know it’s crazy, but everything up ‘til now has been so crazy, and I don’t
know, this just feels right. Y’know?"
144,Joey," (still looking in date book) Hey! That’s the day after I stop
menstruating! (They all look at him.) This isn’t mine."
148,Rachel, Hi!
150,Rachel," Ohh, nothing, I just wanted to see you. See you and hug you. (Hugs him)
See you."
152,Rachel, Yeah! (She sits down) Sit!
154,Rachel," I’m more than okay, I am really, really happy! Wanna know why?"
156,Rachel," ‘Cause I am really happy about us. I think we are, I think we are
so on the right track! Y’know? I mean, I think we are working, I think we are
clicking. Y’know?"
158,Rachel," Yeah-yeah, y’know if-if there was just like one little area where
I—that I think we need—we would need to work on; I-I would think it was
we’re just not crazy enough!"
160,Rachel," Well, yeah, right, y’know what? Yeah, you’re right, I mean, we
no, we have our fun. Yeah! But if (Grunts uncomprehensively)……I mean, I mean
like craaaazy! Y’know? Okay, all right. This is gonna, this is gonna sound
y’know, a little umm, hasty, but uh, just go with it. Umm. Ugh. What if we got
married?"
162,Rachel," Oh, I know, I know, it’s-it’s so, it’s so totally like,
""Whoa! Can we do this?"" Y’know, I mean, but I mean it just feels right!
Don’t you think? It does! I mean, it just feels right, don’t you think?"
167,Joey, Joey Tribbiani.
169,Chandler, (answering for him) Yes he did.
172,Chandler," (waking Joey) Hey, check out that girl! She is really hot!"
173,Joey," (sleepily) Yeah, she is. Wow! (Falls back asleep, loudly) How you
doin’?"
175,Joey, What?!
176,Chandler," You’re coming on to the entire room! (He goes over to pick up a
stack of magazines next to her, and to get her attention, he throws them back down.)
I’m Chandler."
178,Chandler, Hi.
180,Chandler, You mind if I…
183,Chandler," So uh, what are you in for?"
185,Chandler," What a coincidence, I listen in my sleep."
186,Joey, (asleep) So why don’t you give me your number?
188,Monica," Okay, ready?"
189,Phoebe, Yeah.
190,Monica, Okay.
192,Phoebe, (catching it) I got it! Mine! (They both hug)
193,Monica, Congratulations!
194,Phoebe, Thank you!
195,Monica, Okay! My turn! My turn!
196,Phoebe," Okay! (Gets into position) Okay, ready?"
197,Monica," (cocking her head from side to side in some pre-bouquet-catching ritual)
Yeah."
198,Phoebe, Okay. (Phoebe turns and throws it on the couch.)
199,Monica, (upset) That was a terrible throw!!
200,Phoebe, I’m not gonna right to you! That’s not real!
201,Monica," Look at me! My big concern is what’s real?! (Finally realises) Oh
my God. We’re really sad, aren’t we?"
202,Phoebe," Yeah, I think we are."
203,Monica, This isn’t even my dress.
204,Phoebe," Well, at least you didn’t rent yours from a store called,
""It’s Not Too Late."""
205,Monica, I’m changing out of this.
206,Phoebe, Me too.
207,Monica, In like a half-hour?
208,Phoebe, Me too.
209,Monica," Okay, throw it straight this time."
210,Phoebe, Okay.
212,Monica, I’m getting married next!!
213,Phoebe, Yay!
215,Phoebe," I hate my regular clothes now! Y’know? I look down and-and I
know that this isn’t gonna be the most special day of my life."
216,Monica," Yeah. I mean it was kinda fun for a while, but didn’t you start
feeling silly?"
217,Phoebe, I guess.
219,Phoebe, Oh my God! 
220,Monica, Oh God.
221,Phoebe," Oh, you’re such a cheater!"
222,Chandler, (entering) Hello! Little ones.
223,Monica, Hey!
224,Phoebe, Hey!
225,Monica," So, is Joey gonna stop snoring?"
226,Chandler," Yep! And! A beautiful woman agreed to go out with me. (They’re
stunned.) Joey wanted to ask her out, but uh, she picked me."
227,Phoebe," Oh, how’d that happen?"
228,Chandler, Because I’m cooler.
229,Monica," No, seriously."
230,Chandler," Well she’s, she’s the kinda girl—Joey was unconscious. "
232,Joey, (muffled by the mouth guard) Hey you guys! What’s happening?
233,Monica, Oh my God!
234,Phoebe, What is that?
235,Joey," (muffled) Oh, they gave it to me at the sleep clinic, and it’s gonna
help me not to snore."
236,Monica," Well, are you asleep right now, Joe? ‘Cause I don’t think you
have to wear it unless you are!"
237,Joey," (takes out the mouth guard) I know I don’t have too! It tastes good.
(Puts it back in.)"
238,Chandler," Plus, you look cool."
241,Rachel," (entering from her bedroom) Well, I just called Joshua…"
242,Phoebe," Oh, how did it go?"
243,Rachel," Well, I did my best to convince him that I’m not some crazy girl
who is dying to get married—I’m just going through a hard time."
244,Phoebe, What did he say?
245,Rachel," Well uh, his answering machine was very understanding. Ugh. I
feel blue."
246,Monica," Ohh, sweetie! (Goes to comfort her.) Hey, I bet you anything that
he’s gonna call you again."
247,Rachel," Yeah, maybe, but I don’t think I even care. I don’t think
he’s the one I’m sad about. Y’know, I know that I said that I am totally
okay with Ross getting married, but as it turns out, I don’t think I’m handling
it all that well."
248,Phoebe," Yeah, maybe."
249,Rachel, And I-I am just trying to figure out why.
250,Phoebe, Any luck?
251,Rachel," Well, yeah, y’know how Ross and I were on again, off again, on
again, off again? I guess I just figured that somewhere down the road, we would be on
again."
252,Monica, Again. Y’know what? I think we all did.
253,Ross, (entering) Hey!
254,Monica," Hey! (She jumps up and throws Emily’s wedding dress into
Rachel’s room.)"
255,Ross," So, I got us some reservations for Sunday night, okay? How about,
Ernie’s at 9 o’clock?"
256,Rachel," Yeah, well, you uh, better make it for three."
257,Ross," Oh, see I-I don’t know if we’re gonna be hungry at three."
258,Rachel, Three people. Joshua’s not gonna be there.
259,Ross, What happened?
260,Rachel," Uh, well, I think, I think he broke up with me."
261,Ross, Noo. Why?
262,Rachel," Well, apparently he scares easy."
263,Ross," Oh, Rachel, I’m-I’m sorry."
264,Rachel," It’s okay. Sometimes, things don’t work out the way you’d
thought they would."
265,Ross, Come here.
267,Rachel," (breaking the hug) Oh, hey, don’t you have to go pick up Emily?"
268,Ross, Yeah. 
269,Rachel, Yeah.
270,Ross, You okay?
271,Rachel, Yeah! I got my girls.
273,Rachel, Ugh. (She goes over and lays her head on Phoebe’s lap.)
274,Phoebe," (looks at Monica) Hey, y’know what might cheer you up?"
275,Rachel, What?
277,Rachel," Y’know, I gotta tell ya, this really does put in a better mood."
278,Monica," Oh, I wish there was a job where I could wear this all the time. (Pause)
Maybe someday, there will be."
280,Monica," Oh God! He’s gonna come by and borrow some candles for his big
date!"
281,Rachel," Oh, okay! (She goes to answer the door.)"
282,Monica," No-no, Rachel, don’t get it! He can’t see us!"
283,Phoebe," No, yeah! The groom cannot see the bride!"
284,Rachel, I’m not gonna marry Chandler!
285,Phoebe, Not after this!
286,Rachel," Okay, you guys, just relax. (She goes over to open the door, and as she
does, she says.) I doooo. (Sees that it’s Joshua, not Chandler that knocked on the
door.)"
288,Rachel," Oh, wait, Joshua! Joshua! (Pause) (Comes back inside) Yeah, well, that
oughta do it."
291,Joey," (muffled by the mouth guard) Dude! I am trying to sleep! (Shrugs to
say, ""What’s up with that?"")"
0,Chandler," Y’know what? It seems like all of the sudden; so much has
happened."
1,Joey, I know. Ross is getting married.
2,Chandler," Phoebe is, making people."
3,Joey, Everybody’s doing stuff!
4,Chandler," And we just sit here. I mean if I die the only way people would even
know I was here, would be by the ass print on this chair! Look, we have to do something.
Okay? Something huge!"
5,Joey, (snaps his fingers) We could climb Mt. Everest!
6,Chandler," No-no, not something stupid, something huge."
7,Joey," No-no-no-no-no, I saw an ad for this video, people climb that thing
everyday! We could totally do that!"
8,Chandler," Why not?! I mean it’s just, it’s just climbing! It’s
just, it’s just steep!"
9,Joey, Yeah!
10,Chandler," We’re going to Everest! Okay, it would be nice to leave an ass
print on Everest!"
11,Phoebe, (entering) Hey!
12,Joey, Hey!
13,Phoebe, What-what’s up?
14,Joey, We’re gonna climb Mt. Everest!
15,Chandler, Yeah baby!
16,Phoebe," Really?! I looked into that. Yeah, but, I mean it costs like $60,000 and
y’know you can die. And, you would die!"
17,Chandler," (dejected) Yeah, well…"
18,Joey, We could get that Everest video though.
19,Chandler," Yeah, we could do that without y’know risking our lives at all!"
20,Joey," And while we’re down at the video store, you know what else we could
rent? Die Hard! (Chandler’s excited.) Oh, y’know what? I just remembered,
that Everest thing is only available through mail order."
21,Chandler," (dejected) Oh, well…"
22,Phoebe, So you guys’ll stay here and hang out with me?
23,Chandler, Yeeeeahhhh.
24,Joey, Yeah. Yeah.
25,Chandler," But I’ll tell you something. One of these days we’re get off
of our buts and rent Die Hard again!"
26,Joey, Yeah we are!
30,Ross," Ohh, God, nobody likes him, and he’s so cheap, he’d never fly to
London in a million years. Yeah, invite him? Hey, did I do these neat enough? (Hands her
some envelopes.)"
32,Ross, Yeah?
34,Ross, Sure. Why not?
36,Ross, Yeah?
38,Ross," Wait-wait-wait, do you, do you think, maybe we shouldn’t invite her?"
40,Ross, Yeah sure.
42,Ross," Huh? Yeah, fine, invite whoever you want."
45,Ross," I don't want to be single, okay? I just... I just- I just wanna be married
again!"
47,Chandler, And I just want a million dollars! (He extends his hand hopefully.)
48,Monica, Rachel?!
49,Rachel," Oh God Monica hi! I just went to your building and you weren't there and
then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are!"
51,Monica," Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor. (To
Rachel) This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my
brother Ross? "
52,Rachel," Hi, sure!"
53,Ross, Hi. 
57,Ross," You know you probably didn't know this, but back in high school, I had a,
um, major crush on you."
58,Rachel, I knew.
59,Ross," You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky
older brother."
60,Rachel, I did.
61,Ross," Oh. Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability
become any kind of a factor here—but do you think it would be okay if I asked you
out? Sometime? Maybe?"
62,Rachel," Yeah, maybe..."
63,Ross," Okay... okay, maybe I will..."
66,Ross,"  See, I see.... big passion in your future."
67,Rachel, Really?
68,Ross, I do.
69,Rachel," Oh Ross, you're so great. [she playfully rubs his head and gets up]"
71,Joey, It's never gonna happen.
74,Ross," Hey, I have a question. Well, actually, it's not so much a question as..
more of a general wondering... ment."
75,Rachel, Okay.
76,Ross," Okay. Umm, for a while now, I've been wanting to, um...."
77,Rachel, Ohhh!!!! [looking at something behind Ross]
78,Ross," Yes, yes, that's right..."
79,Rachel," Oh, look at the little cat! [a small kitten is on the roof behind Ross]
Look at it!"
80,Ross, What? [the cat jumps on his shoulders] Ow!
85,Rachel," All right, listen, missy. If you want this cart, you're gonna have to
take me with it! "
87,Rachel, (to Ross) Yes! Did you see that?
88,Ross," You were incredible! Brand new woman, ladies and gentlemen."
89,Rachel, I could not have done this without you.
91,Ross," Ok, um, uh, more clothes in the dryer? (Ross turns and bangs his head on
an open dryer door.) I'm fine, I'm fine."
94,Ross, You had no right to tell me you ever had feelings for me.
95,Rachel, (hurt) What?
96,Ross, I was doing great with Julie before I found out about you.
97,Rachel," Hey, I was doin' great before I found out about you. You think it's easy
for me to see you with Julie?"
99,Ross," The point is I... I don't need this right now, OK. It, it's too late, I'm
with somebody else, I'm happy. This ship has sailed."
101,Rachel," Alright, fine, you go ahead and you do that, alright Ross."
102,Ross, Fine.
103,Rachel, 'Cause I don't need your stupid ship.
104,Ross, Good.
105,Rachel, Good. (Ross leaves)
112,Rachel," Ross do you realise this is the first time in my life I’m doing
something I actually care about. This is the first time in my life I’m doing
something that I’m actually good at. I mean. if you don’t get that..."
113,Ross," No, hey, I get that, okay, I get that big time. And I’m happy for ya,
but I’m tired of having a relationship with your answering machine! Okay, I
don’t know what to do anymore."
114,Rachel, Well neither do I!
115,Ross, Is this about Mark?
116,Rachel, (shocked) Oh my God.
117,Ross," Okay, it’s not, it’s not."
118,Rachel," Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight over and over again,
Ross, no, you’re, you’re, you’re making this too hard."
119,Ross," Oh I’m, I’m making this too hard. Okay, what do you want me to
do."
120,Rachel," I don’t know, I don’t know. Urrrgh! Look, maybe we should take
a break."
121,Ross," Okay, okay, fine, you’re right. Let’s ah, let’s take a
break, (goes to the door) let’s cool off, okay, let’s get some frozen yogart, or
something.. (opens the door)"
122,Rachel, No. (Ross is standing in the doorway.) A break from us.
127,Ross," Yeah, y'know the ah, the girlfriend I told you about last night?
(He’s frantically throwing the cushions off of the couch looking for her other shoe)
Well it turns out she ah, she wants to get back together with me. Oh, I found it!! "
129,Ross, Yeah! 
132,Ross," Oh, thank you. (She goes to kiss him, but he holds her coat up between
their faces to stop her.) Hey, hey. (opens the door, sees Rachel, and hides Chloe behind
the door) Rachel!!!!"
133,Rachel," Hi. Ohhh, you got my message."
134,Ross," Yeah, oh hey, you are right on time."
135,Rachel, So what do you say? Can I be your girlfriend again?
136,Ross," Yes, you can, very much."
138,Ross, (seeing the thumbs up) Ahhhh!! (Hugs Rachel tighter.)
141,Rachel," (opening the door) Y'know what, I want you to leave! Get outta here! "
142,Ross, No!!
143,Rachel, Just get out! Now!!
144,Ross, No!! No!! I wanna stay. I wanna talk about this.
145,Rachel, Okay! All right! How was she?
147,Chandler, Uh-oh.
149,Ross, What?
150,Rachel, Was she good?
152,Joey, Don’t answer that.
154,Rachel," Come on Ross! You said you wanted to talk about it, let’s talk
about it!! How was she?"
155,Ross, She was...
157,Joey, Awful! Horrible!
158,Chandler, She was not good. Not good.
159,Joey, She was nothing compared to you.
161,Ross," She, she was different."
163,Joey, Ewwwww!
164,Chandler, Uh-oh.
166,Rachel, Good different?
167,Ross, Nobody likes change.
169,Ross," What? Okay, okay, okay, okay."
172,Rachel,"  ...the way you owned up to everything, it just showed me how much
you’ve grown. Y'know?  I mean my Mom never thought this would work out.
It was all, “Once a cheater, always a cheater.”  Ooh, I just wish we
hadn’t lost those four months, but if time was what you needed just to gain a little
perspective..."
173,Ross, WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!!!!!
178,Rachel, You seem to really like her.
179,Ross," Yeah, I really do. Yeah, but what am I gonna do, I mean we-we both agreed
that it was gonna be a two-week thing, y’know no commitment."
180,Rachel," Ross, that girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends,
asking to hear stories about you, looking through Monica’s photo albums, I mean you
don’t do that if you’re just in it for two weeks."
181,Ross, You think?
182,Rachel," Yeah, you got like 14 hours until she has to be at the airport, and
you’re sitting here in the hallway with a 28-year-old cheerleader with a fat lip."
183,Ross," Hey, you’re right."
184,Rachel, Yeah.
188,Monica," Ohh, this is soo amazing! I can’t believe my brother’s getting
married! And in London! It’s so romantic!"
189,Joey," (taking apart the invitation) Hey, pretty smart! Tissue paper! You’re
at the wedding, you have to cry, ""Handkerchief?"" ""No-no, I got my
invitation."""
190,Phoebe," Oooh look! Isn’t this adorable, Ross let Ben address mine!"
191,Chandler, (entering) Hello!
192,Joey, Hey!
193,Monica, Hey!
194,Phoebe," Hey! Hey, did you get your invitation to Ross’s wedding?"
195,Chandler, (sarcastic) Noo.
196,Joey," Don’t worry man, I get to bring a guest. We’ll show him."
197,Phoebe," I’m so jealous you’re all going! I can’t believe I never
knew that you can’t fly in your third trimester!"
198,Chandler, I didn’t know that.
199,Monica, I never knew that either.
200,Joey," I knew that! (They all look at him) I sooo didn’t know that, but you
should see your faces."
201,Rachel, (entering) Hey guys! What’s up?
202,Joey, Heyyy. (They all try and hide their invitations.)
203,Monica, We’re hanging out.
205,Rachel, What’s this? Is this Ross’s wedding invitation?
206,Chandler," See, maybe that’s the one we should’ve actually hidden."
207,Rachel," Oh, no! No you guys! Come on, you don’t have to do that! I’m
happy for him! I am! I really—I’m-I’m happ—I’ll work on it."
208,Monica, I’m sorry honey.
209,Rachel, Yeah.
210,Monica," Rach, you’re gonna come though aren’t you?"
211,Rachel," Oh, honey, I don’t know. I…"
212,Chandler," This isn’t one of those uh, y’know ""If she doesn’t
come, we-we don’t, we don’t come?"" Right? Because I already bought my
ticket…"
213,Monica," You know what would be real weird? Is if you weren’t there. Just
say you’ll think about it, okay?"
214,Rachel," No, I’ll think about it. Yeah."
218,Rachel, Who's this from?
219,Chandler," Oh, that's Ross's. "
220,Rachel, Oh... (opens it and sees it is a pin) Oh my God. He remembered.
221,Phoebe, Remembered what?
222,Rachel," It was like months ago. We were walking by this antique store, and I saw
this pin in the window, and I told him that it was just like one my grandmother had when I
was a little girl. Oh! I can't believe he remembered!"
223,Phoebe," Oh, it's so pretty. This must have cost him a fortune."
224,Monica, I can't believe he did this.
225,Chandler," Come on, Ross? Remember back in college, when he fell in love with
Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?"
227,Rachel, What did you just say?
228,Chandler, (stuttering incoherently) F-hah.... flennin....
229,Rachel, Oh.... my God.
232,Rachel,  (seeing Ross come off the plane with another woman.) Oh my God.
236,Ross," But we haven't seen each other since then. Well I land in China, guess
who's in charge of the dig. "
237,Rachel," Julie! Julie, isn't that great? I mean, isn't that just kick-
you-in-the-crotch, spit-on-your-neck fantastic?"
240,Ross," Oh, that is so sweet.(listens) No, no, ok, you hang up. Ok, ok, one, two,
three.(He doesn't hang up and motions for Rachel to be quiet.) Well you didn't hang up
either. "
241,Rachel,  She didn't hang up either...
242,Ross,"  Ok, no, no, you hang up. You, you, y—(Rachel grabs the phone
and hangs it up for him.)"
245,Rachel," (on phone) Ross, hi, it's Rachel. I'm just calling to say that um,
everything's fine and I'm really happy for you and your cat...(cut)...I
am over you. I am over you and that, my friend, is what they call closure. (She hangs up
and tosses phone in the ice bucket.)"
248,Ross," Rach, I got a message from you."
250,Rachel," Oh my God. Oh my God Ross, no, hang up the phone, give me the phone
Ross, give me the phone, give me the phone, give me the. . . (She jumps the couch and
lands on Ross's back, finally getting the phone from him. Ross has a confused expression
on his face.)"
251,Ross, You're over me?
252,Rachel, Ohhhhhhhh God. (climbs off his back)
253,Ross," Wha... you're uh, you're, you're over me?"
254,Rachel," Ohh, ohh."
255,Ross," When, when were you... under me?"
256,Rachel," Well, basically, lately, I've uh, I've uh, sort of had feelings for you."
258,Ross," OK, I need to lie down. "
261,Joey," He broke up with Julie. Well, go hug her, for god's sakes."
262,Rachel, Really?
263,Ross," Really. It's always been you, Rach."
264,Rachel," Oh, god."
269,Ross," I've no idea, could be. Listen, I'm sorry I had to work tonight."
270,Rachel," Oh it's OK. You were worth the wait, and I don't just mean tonight."
272,Rachel," Ah, oh God. Oh, honey, oh that's OK."
273,Ross," What. Oh no, you just rolled over the juice box."
276,Ross," Gunther! Gunther. Gunther, please tell me you didn’t say anything to
Rachel about me and the girl from the Xerox place."
281,Ross," Y'know, hey! You’re the one who ended it, remember?"
282,Rachel," Yeah, because I was mad at you, not because I stopped loving you!"
283,Ross, You still love me?
284,Rachel, Noo.
286,Ross," What does this mean? What do you, I mean do you wanna, get back together?"
287,Rachel," Noo! Maybe! I, I don’t know. "
288,Ross, What?!
289,Rachel," I just, I feel, I-I just..."
293,Rachel," Y'know I can’t believe I even thought about getting back
together again! We are so over!!"
294,Ross," (starts to cry) FINE BY ME!! (he opens the door and traps Chandler behind
it)"
296,Rachel," And hey! Just so you know, it’s not that common! It doesn’t
happen to every guy! And it is a big deal!!"
297,Chandler, I KNEW IT!!!!
303,Rachel, Oh my God.
304,Monica," You know what this is, this is us getting ready for the prom."
305,Rachel, Oh.
306,Ross," You know what, you guys, we don't have to watch this."
310,Monica," Shut up, the camera adds ten pounds."
311,Chandler," Ahh, so how many cameras are actually on you?"
313,Monica," Oh, dad, turn it off."
315,Joey, Lookin' good Mr. Cotter.
317,Rachel," I can't go to my own prom without a date, I can't, it's too
late."
318,Monica, If you're not going then I don't want to go either.
321,Ross," Y'know what?  I think we've seen enough, let's turn it off."
323,Ross," OK, fine, well I'm not gonna watch, alright."
327,Ross," (walks down the stairs and grabs the flowers out of the vase on
the endtable) Okay dad."
332,Ross," Yeah, well."
334,Phoebe," See, he's her lobster."
336,Monica, (seeing the decision) Nooooo. You’re really not going?
337,Rachel," Yeah. It’s just gonna be too hard. Y’know? I mean, it’s
Ross. How can I watch him get married? Y’know it’s just, it’s for the best,
y’know it is, it’s… Y’know, plus, somebody’s got to stay here
with Phoebe! Y’know she’s gonna be pretty big by then, and she needs someone to
help her tie her shoes; drive her to the hospital in case she goes into labour."
338,Monica, You don’t have a car. And your license expired. 
339,Rachel," I know. (Starts to cry) Yeah, see, there’s so much to do and I have
so little time to do it in."
342,Chandler," All right, check it out. Check this out. It says here that
there’s a place you can go to rent videos of all the museums! (Reading from the
book.) ""It’s almost as good as being there."""
343,Joey, It’s better! You can’t go to a museum in your underwear!
344,Chandler," Well, You could, but... probably just the one
time."
345,Joey," I bet we could get videos of all the sites, get a VCR in our
hotel room... we'd never even have to go outside!"
346,Chandler," If we do that, we gotta get Die Hard."
347,Joey, Oh-ho! I bet the British version is gooooood!
0,Phoebe," (angrily) That’s like the tenth time I’ve peed since I’ve
been here!"
1,Monica, That’s also like the tenth time you told us.
2,Phoebe," Yeah, oh I’m sorry, it must be really hard to hear! I tell ya,
it’s a lot easier having three babies play Bringing in the Noise, Bringing in da Funk
on your bladder! I’m so sick of being pregnant! The only happiness I get is from a
cup of coffee, which of course is decaf, ‘cause—Oh! I’m pregnant!"
3,Ross," Pheebs, did…you want a cookie?"
4,Phoebe, (starting to cry) Thank you so much.
5,Rachel," So uh, Pheebs, honey, how are those mood swings coming?"
6,Phoebe, I haven’t really had any yet.
10,Ross, Hey guys!
11,Chandler, Hey.
12,Joey, Hey!
13,Ross," All right, here’s the ring. (Shows Chandler the wedding ring he plans
on giving Emily) "
14,Chandler," (shocked) Yes! Yes! A thousand times, yes!"
15,Ross," So uh, any ideas for the bachelor party yet?"
16,Joey," Whoa-whoa-whoa! Before you start handing out wedding rings and planning
bachelor parties, don’t you have to decide who your best man is gonna be?"
17,Chandler," Oh, it’s awkward. It’s awkward. It’s awkward."
18,Ross, I sort’ve already asked Chandler.
19,Joey, What?! He got to do it at your first wedding!
20,Ross," Joey, I figured you’d understand. I mean, I-I’ve known him a lot
longer."
21,Joey," Come on Ross! Look, I-I don’t have any brothers; I’ll never get
to be a best man!"
22,Chandler, You can be the best man when I get married.
23,Joey, (pause) I’ll never get to be a best man!
24,Ross," (to Chandler) Wait-wait, so, you get to be my best man twice and I never
get to be yours at all?"
25,Chandler," Oh no-no-no, you—yeah, of course you get to be my best man."
26,Joey," (impatiently tapping Chandler on the shoulder) What about me?! You-you
just said I could!"
27,Chandler," I’m not even getting married! Okay, this is a question for
science fiction writers!"
28,Joey, I can’t believe you’re not picking me.
29,Ross," Hey, how can it not be me?!HeyHey!"
30,Chandler, I’m not even… I’m not even…
31,Ross," Fine, y’know what, that’s it. From now on, Joey, I want you to
be my best man."
32,Joey, Yes! (to Chandler) Shame about you man.
34,Phoebe, (to her babies) Stop it!
35,Monica, What?
36,Phoebe, One of the babies is kicking.
37,Monica, I thought that was a good thing.
38,Phoebe," It’s not kicking me, it’s kicking one of the other babies. Oh
(looks down her dress)! Don’t make me come in there!"
39,Joey, (entering) Hey!
40,Monica, Hey!
41,Joey, Do you guys have like a big bowl I can borrow?
42,Monica," Yeah, there’s one right under the cabinet. "
43,Joey, (grabs it) Thanks.
44,Monica, Why do you need it?
45,Joey," Oh, we’re having a big party tomorrow night. Later! (Starts for the
door.)"
46,Rachel," Whoa! Hey-hey, you planning on inviting us?"
47,Joey," Nooo, later. (Walks out the door.)"
48,Phoebe," Hey!! Get your ass back here, Tribbiani!! (Joey walks back in, scared.)"
49,Rachel, Hormones!
50,Monica," What Phoebe meant to say was umm, how come you’re having a party
and we’re not invited?"
51,Joey," Oh, it’s Ross’s bachelor party."
52,Monica, Sooo?
53,Joey, Are you bachelors?
54,Monica, Nooo!
55,Joey, Are you strippers?
56,Rachel, Nooo!
57,Joey, Then you’re not invited. (Starts for the door again.)
58,Rachel," All right fine! You’re not invited to the party we’re gonna
have either."
59,Joey," Oh-whoa, what party?"
60,Rachel, Well umm…
61,Monica, The baby shower for Phoebe!
62,Joey," Baby shower. Wow! That sounds sooo like something I don’t want to do!
Later! (Finally, he makes his exit.)"
63,Phoebe," I can’t believe I’m gonna have a party! This is so great!
(Really excited) A party! (Really, really excited) Yay!! (Suddenly, she starts crying and
Rachel moves to comfort her.) I don’t know why."
65,Joey," This is what I’ve got going for the party so far, liquor wise. Get a
lot of liquor."
66,Ross, Great. Great.
67,Joey," Okay, now uh, in terms of the invite list, I’ve got you, me, and
Chandler and I’m gonna invite Gunther ‘cause, well, we’ve been talking
about this pretty loud."
69,Joey," All right—oh! Listen, I know this is your party, but I’d really
like to the number of museum geeks that are gonna be there."
70,Ross," Yeah. Tell ya what, let’s not invite any of the anthropologists, only
the dinosaur dudes!"
71,Joey, Okay! We’ll need a six-pack of Zima.
72,Chandler," (entering) Hey guys, what are you doing?"
73,Ross," Oh, just planning my bachelor party with my best man."
74,Chandler," Yeah, well, good luck trying to top the last one."
75,Ross," Yeah, see, I don’t think it’s gonna that difficult considering
this one won’t be taking place in the basement of a Pizza Hut."
76,Chandler," Oh, I’m Ross. I’m Ross. I’m too good for the Hut;
I’m too good for the Hut."
77,Ross," Look, I gotta go pick up Ben. Everything so far sounds great Joey, just
remember to keep it on the mellow side, okay? Just a couple of guys hanging out playing
poker, no-no strippers or anything okay?"
78,Joey, You got it.
79,Ross," Okay, see ya later."
80,Chandler," See ya. (Ross exits, and Chandler moves over next to Joey, laughing.)
Have fun planning your mellow bachelor party."
81,Joey," Well, there’s gonna be strippers there. He didn’t say anything
about no strippers."
82,Chandler," He just said, ""No strippers."""
83,Joey," Oh, I chose not to hear that."
85,Monica," Look what I got! Look what I got! Look what I got! (She shows Rachel
what she bought. She bought a little leather jacket and a little cowboy outfit for the
babies.) Can you believe they make these for little people?"
86,Rachel, Little village people.
87,Monica," Okay, look at this one. This is my favourite. (It’s a little pink
and white dress for the girl baby.)"
88,Rachel," Oh, that is so sweet!"
89,Monica, I know! Phoebe is gonna love dressing them in these!
90,Rachel," Huh. Except, Phoebe’s not gonna be the one that gets to dress them."
91,Monica, Because she’s not gonna get to keep the babies.
92,Rachel, Oh my God! We are throwing the most depressing baby shower ever!
93,Monica," Wait a minute! Unless, we give her all gifts she can use after
she’s done being pregnant. Like-like umm, regular coffee, Tequila."
94,Rachel," Oh, and somebody can get those leather pants she’s always wanted!"
95,Monica," Oh, she’s gonna love that!"
97,Phoebe," What the hell is this?! What, did you actually thought it would make me
feel better to give me stuff that I can’t use for another two months?! This sucks!
All right, what’s my next present?!"
100,Ross," Hey listen man, about the stripper…"
101,Joey, Yeah?
102,Ross, Good call!
103,Chandler," (banging a spoon against his beer bottle) Okay, a little announcement,
a little announcement. I’ve decided that my best man is, my best friend Gunther!"
105,Chandler, Central Perk?
107,Joey," Oh-whoa-wait, Gunther don’t-don’t forget your shirt. (He gives
Gunther his shirt and Gunther leaves.)"
108,Ross," Hey-hey, what are those?"
109,Joey," Oh, little party favours, check it out! (It’s a shirt that reads,
""Ross Geller, Bachelor Bash 1998"")"
110,Ross, Wow! Yeah!
111,Joey," Oh-oh! (Shows him what’s on the back, ""Best Man Joey Tribbiani,
with a huge picture of him.)"
112,Chandler," (banging on the bottle again) Okay, okay, a little announcement, I
just want everyone to know that the position of my best man is still open! And uh, (to the
stripper) so is the position of the bride."
114,Ross," Smooth man. Yeah, you got some chilie on your neck. (Chandler checks and
runs into the bathroom.) Well, I just want to say, thanks everyone, this-this was great.
And hey! See you guys Monday morning. (They museum geeks wave at him.) Thanks Joey."
115,Joey," Oh, hey, don’t forget your shirt."
116,Ross," Oh, thanks! (Takes it and throws it back into the box and leaves.)"
117,Joey," Okay, hey, museum geeks, party’s over. Okay. Wave bye-bye to the nice
lady. There you go. Back to your parent’s basement. All right. (The museum geeks exit
and Joey unlocks his door and lets the chick and the duck out.) Come on boys, come on out!
Here you go. All right."
119,Joey, Yeah!
121,Joey," Oh yeah-yeah. And I got the duck totally trained. Watch this. Stare at the
wall. (The duck complies.) Hardly move. (The duck complies.) Be white. (The duck
complies.)"
123,Joey," Oh thanks. Thanks. It was great meetin’ ya. And listen if any of my
friends gets married, or have a birthday, or a Tuesday…"
125,Joey," Oh unless you uh, you wanna hang around."
127,Joey, Yeah. I’ll let you play with my duck.
129,Joey," Hey, (realises he doesn’t know her name.) stripper! (He notices that
the ring box is open, so he picks it up, sees it’s empty and starts to panic.)"
132,Joey," (running and banging on Chandler’s door) The stripper stole the
ring!! The stripper stole the ring!! Chandler! Chandler, get up! Get up! The stripper
stole the ring!"
133,Chandler, (opening the door) What?
134,Joey, The ring is gone!
135,Chandler," Ugh. Just a sec, give me a minute to wake up for this—Ah-ha-ha!!
You lost the ring! You’re the worst best man ever!"
136,Joey," Dude, this isn’t funny! What am I gonna do?! I go to bed last night,
everything’s cool! I wake up this morning, the stripper’s gone and the ring is
gone!"
137,Chandler, You slept with the stripper?
138,Joey, Of course!! (Shrugs.)
140,Phoebe," Hi, guys."
141,Rachel, Hi! Phoebe. (Both Monica and her try to move out of Phoebe’s way.)
142,Monica, Hi Phoebe.
143,Phoebe," I-I wanted to apologise if I—y’know seemed a tad edgy
yesterday at my shower. Y’know it’s just the hormones, y’know."
144,Rachel, No we…
145,Monica, Hormones.
146,Rachel," …hormones, yeah."
147,Phoebe," Anyway, I just wanted to say thank you, it was just, it was so sweet.
(She goes to hug them and they both flinch, thinking that Phoebe is about to attack them.)"
148,Monica," Wow, you seem to be doing so much better. That’s great. So how-how
are things going?"
149,Phoebe," Good. Y’know—no-no, okay, it’s-it feels like
everything’s been about me lately, so what’s happening with you?"
150,Rachel," Oh, well, actually we were just talking about me not going to
Ross’s wedding."
151,Phoebe, Oh!
152,Rachel," It just might be too hard, given the history and all that…"
153,Phoebe," Wow! This reminds me of the time when I was umm, living on the street
and this guy offered to buy me food if I slept with him."
154,Rachel," Well, h-how is this like that?"
155,Phoebe," Well, let’s see, it’s not. Really, like that. Because, you see
that was an actual problem, and uh, yours is just like y’know a bunch of
y’know high school crap that nobody really gives y’know…"
156,Rachel," (starting to cry) I’m-I’m sorry, I just thought that…"
157,Phoebe," Alrighty, here come the water works. (Rachel starts crying harder.)"
159,Joey," Ugh! I don’t know what I’m going to do! I called the company
that sent and th-they don’t care! Then I called 9-1-1 and they laughed at me, if this
isn’t an emergency, then what is?"
160,Ross, (entering) Hey guys!
161,Chandler, Hey!
162,Joey, Hey…
163,Ross," I just wanted to thank you again for last night, what a great party! And
the guys from work had a blast. Y’know, one of them had never been to a bachelor
party before. Yeah! And-and another one had never been to a party before, so…"
164,Joey," So uh, hey, that uh, that wedding ring, huh? Man, that’s nice!"
165,Ross," Yeah, right!"
166,Joey," I was uh, I was thinking I might want to pick one of those babies up for
myself, I might want to get one of those…"
167,Ross," That ring? When my grandmother first came to this country, that ring and
the clothes on her back were all she had with her."
168,Chandler," So you might say, the ring is irreplaceable? (Gives Joey a little
squeeze.)"
169,Ross," Oh absolutely! It has been in my family for generations, and every bride
who has worn it has had a long and happy life."
170,Chandler," So you might say, it’s a magic ring."
171,Joey," (laughs, softly) Yeah, the stripper stole it."
172,Ross," My-my ring? My-my wedding ring? The-the stripper stole my wedding ring?!
H-how?! How could this all happen?!"
173,Chandler," Well, I think it all started when you said, ""Hey Joey, why
don’t you be my best man."""
174,Ross," (dialling the phone) All right-all right, fine! I-I’m gonna call the
cops!"
175,Joey," Dude, I screwed up, you don’t have to turn me in!"
176,Ross, Not on you! On the stripper!
177,Joey," Oh, yeah, well I already did that! They said they’re gonna look into
it right after they solved all the murders."
178,Ross," Okay, well, we’ll call the company that sent her!"
179,Joey," I did that too! They wouldn’t give me her real name or her number.
They said, ""If I bothered them again they’d call the police."" I said,
""If you talk to the police, you tell them I’m missing a ring!"""
180,Ross," So what, Joey? Wh-wh-what? What are you telling me? That there’s
nothing we can do? Well, how could this happen?!"
181,Joey," Look Ross, I am so-so sorry. I-I-I…"
182,Chandler," Well, what if we just ah, called her, used a fake name, and had her
come to my office?"
183,Joey," Oh, that sounds like fun, but we’ve got a ring to find!!"
185,Monica," Here’s your tea Phoebe. (They give it to her and quickly take a
step back.)"
186,Phoebe," (sips it) It’s so good. (Monica and Rachel breath a sigh of
relief.) Oh, thanks."
187,Rachel, Good.
188,Monica, I’m so glad you liked it.
189,Phoebe, (sets the cup down) Oh! (Grabs her stomach in pain.)
190,Monica, What?!
191,Rachel, What?! She made the tea! (Points to Monica.)
192,Phoebe," Oh! No, I-I think I just had a contraction."
193,Rachel, You what?
194,Monica, Oh my God!
195,Phoebe," Yeah, I thought I had one a couple of minutes ago, and now I know that
was definitely one."
196,Monica," Wait, you can’t have the baby here! I mean I haven’t
sterilised it since the guys moved out!"
197,Rachel," Okay. It’s okay. We’re gonna be okay. Y’know what?
It’s okay. I’m gonna, I’m gonna, I’m gonna boil some water and just
rip up some sheets!"
198,Phoebe," No. It’s all right; it’s probably false labour. They said
that, that can happen near the end, just somebody get the book."
199,Monica," Rachel, get the book! The book!"
200,Rachel, Okay! (Runs and grabs a book and hands it to Monica.) Okay! Here!
201,Monica, The Bible?!
202,Rachel, I don’t know!
204,Joey," All right, okay, this is great, uh, Chandler, you get behind the desk.
And-and when she comes in hopefully, she won’t recognise you because, well, why would
she? Uh, okay, and then you buzz Ross and I. (to Ross) You be Mr. Gonzalez, and I’ll
be uh, Mr. Wong."
205,Ross, Diverse.
208,Chandler," (to Ross) You be cool. (He opens the door and lets her in as they all
turn there backs on her.)"
210,Ross," Where’s my ring? My dead grandmother’s wedding ring? Where is
it? Where is it?"
211,Chandler," Way to be cool, man."
213,Joey," There was a ring, in a box, on my nightstand, after you left, it was gone!"
216,Ross, We know you took so just-just save yourself the time and confess!
218,Chandler, Marry me. (Both Ross and Chandler hit him.)
220,Joey," I don’t get it! It was in my room all night! And if she didn’t
take it, and I didn’t take it; and you (Chandler) didn’t take it, then who did?
(The duck quacks.) Shh! We’re trying to think! (Ross and Chandler realise it at the
same moment and stare at Joey, who doesn’t get it. After a short pause, with the duck
still quacking, Joey figures it out and starts pointing at the duck.)"
222,Rachel, I still don’t get how you know when it’s false labour.
223,Phoebe," Well, do you see any babies?"
224,Monica, How do you feel?
225,Phoebe," Okay, I guess. I mean… I don’t know, it’s just, I guess I
know it’s going to be over soon."
226,Rachel," Well, isn’t that a good thing? You said you were sick of this."
227,Phoebe," I know. It’s just y’know usually when you’re, when
you’re done with the pregnant thing, y’know, then you get to do the mom thing.
I’m gonna be y’know, sitting around in my leather pants, drinking Tequila."
228,Monica, Some moms do that.
229,Phoebe," Okay that’s even sadder. Look, I know, I know what I got myself
into, it’s just that now that they’re in me it’s like, it’s like I
know them y’know, I mean-I mean, it’s just not gonna be easy when these little
babies have to go away."
230,Monica," Aww, sweetie, but it’s not like you’re not gonna have
anything. You’re gonna have nieces and nephews, and some ways that’s even
better."
231,Phoebe," Yeah, okay."
232,Rachel," No, really. Really, Pheebs, you’re not gonna be the one worrying
about saving for college, or yelling at them when they’re bad, y’know, or
deciding to put them on Ritalin when they just won’t calm down. Y’know?"
233,Monica," I mean, you’re the one they’re gonna come to when they wanna
run away from home, and the one they talk to about sex."
234,Rachel, And you just get to be cool Aunt Phoebe!
235,Phoebe, Cool Aunt Phoebe. I am pretty cool!
236,Monica, Yeah.
237,Rachel," And y’know what else, oh my God, are they gonna love you."
238,Phoebe, They are gonna love me.
239,Rachel, Oh!
240,Phoebe, Thanks you guys! Again.
241,Monica," Oh, sweetie! (They all hug.)"
242,Phoebe, You’re the best. Thanks. Oh! 
244,Phoebe, Just kidding. Ahh!
245,Rachel, What?!
246,Monica, Oh my God!
247,Phoebe," Got cha again, you guys are so easy."
249,Joey, If anything should happen to him…
250,Ross, Joey! The vet said it’s a simple procedure.
251,Joey," So! Things can go wrong! You don’t know! What if he doesn’t make
it?!"
252,Chandler," He will, Joe."
253,Joey," Yeah, but what if he doesn’t? He’s such a good duck."
255,Joey," I’m so worried about him, y’know?"
257,Ross," Oh my God! Thank you! Thank you so much! (He grabs the ring, kisses it,
and then does a double-take realising where it’s been.)"
258,Joey, H-h-h-how’s the duck?
260,Joey," Ohh, great! Oh hey, listen Ross, thanks for being so cool about this."
261,Ross," No, that’s all right."
262,Joey," No, it’s not. I mean you-you made me your best man and I totally let
you down!"
263,Chandler," Hey, come on, it’s not your fault."
264,Joey," Yeah, it is! You wouldn’t have lost the ring, right? Y’know
what, Ross you were right from the start, he (Chandler) should be your best man."
265,Chandler," No, you should."
266,Joey," Now, don’t argue with me…"
267,Ross," Hey! Hey! Hey! I get to choose my best man, and I want both you
guys. "
268,Chandler, Really?
269,Joey, Really?
270,Ross," Hey, both you guys should be up there with me. I mean, you two are-are
my… I mean, I’m lucky to have just one good… (They all start getting
emotional.)"
271,Chandler, Thanks man.
272,Joey," (starting to cry) I gotta go check something over here. (He walks away so
that they can’t see him cry.)"
273,Chandler, What a baby.
274,Ross, Total wuss!
0,Monica," Guys, hurry up! The flight leaves in four hours! It could take time to
get a taxi! There could be traffic! The plane could leave early! When we get to London,
there could be a line at customs! Come on!! (She runs back to her apartment.)"
1,Chandler, Six-hour trip to London. That’s a lot of Monica.
3,Monica," Passport, check! (As she puts away each item, she says check.) Camera,
check! Traveller’s cheques, check! "
4,Rachel," Who are you saying ""check"" too?"
5,Monica," Myself. Y’know for remembering to pack a thing. Yeah, you do a good
thing, you get a check! (pause) My mom does it, I never realized it was weird."
6,Phoebe," Yeah, my mom used to put her head in the oven. Well, actually, she only
did it the one time. But it was pretty weird."
7,Ross, (entering) Hey!
8,Monica, Hey!
9,Ross, Hey! Are you ready yet?
10,Monica, Yep! You got the tickets?
11,Ross," Oh! Got ‘em right here, (Pats his coat pocket) check!"
13,Joey," It’s all London, baby! Here we go. (He takes a picture of a less than
enthused Chandler and starts towards the girls’ apartment.)"
14,Chandler, You got your passport?
15,Joey," Yeah, in my third drawer on my dresser. You don’t want to lose that."
17,Joey, Ohh!! (Runs to his room.)
18,Chandler, There it is.
21,Monica," Okay, if you need the vacuum, it’s in my closet on the left-hand
side. Ah, the garbage bags are next to the refrigerator…"
22,Phoebe," Okay, okay, but Rachel’s gonna be here too, can’t I just ask
her this stuff?"
23,Monica," Yeah, okay, give that a try!"
24,Chandler," (entering, with Joey) All right! Let’s do it!"
25,Joey, Woo-hoo!!
26,Ross," Yeah, cheerie-o! "
27,Joey, London baby!
28,Chandler," Okay, ‘cause that’s not gonna get annoying."
29,Joey, (louder) London baby!!
30,Chandler," Hey, y’know what? I was wrong."
31,Ross," Well, we’re all here! I guess we should get going!"
32,Phoebe," Ohhh, I wanna come over there and give you a hug and wish you luck on
your wedding, but I don’t—can’t get up."
33,Ross," Oh, I’ll-I’ll come hug you."
34,Phoebe," Great! Yeah, could you bring me the newspaper?"
35,Ross, Yeah. (He does so and Phoebe hugs him.)
36,Phoebe," Oh, have a great wedding!"
37,Ross, Thanks.
38,Phoebe," Oh, hey, Chandler I wanna hug you too!"
39,Chandler, Hey! (Trots over)
40,Phoebe," Oh, and great! You might as well bring me my book, it’s on the
counter in your apartment."
41,Chandler," Oh. (Goes and gets Phoebe’s book as Rachel comes in from her
room.)"
42,Ross," (to Rachel) So, we’re off."
43,Rachel, Have fun!
44,Ross," Thanks! (They hug.) Ugh, I can’t believe you’re not gonna be
there!"
45,Rachel," Oh, I know."
46,Ross, So-so come! Why don’t you come?
47,Rachel, What?!
48,Ross, To London! Come to London. Please? It’ll mean so much to me.
49,Rachel," Yeah, well, I gotta work, I’m sorry."
50,Ross, Why-why can’t you take a couple of days off?
51,Rachel," Because, I can’t! Ross, I told you, no. I can’t."
52,Ross, This is my wedding.
53,Monica," All right, y’know what? We really are late! Let’s go!
Let’s go! Let’s go!!"
54,Ross, Fine. You’ll-you’ll watch it on video when we get back.
55,Chandler," (entering, with Phoebe’s book.) Here you go Phoebe! Here you go
Phobo! Phewbedo! Phaybobo."
56,Phoebe, (laughs) Thank you.
58,Phoebe, Thank you. (She pats him on his head.)
59,Ross," All right, let’s go! Bye, Pheebs!"
60,Joey," Bye, Pheebs!"
62,Joey," London baby!! (And Rachel slowly closes the door, sadly.)"
63,Phoebe," Oh, do you need a hug? You don’t have to bring me anything!"
66,Joey, Come on! Do something!
67,Chandler," I am, I’m ignoring you."
68,Joey," Okay, here! (Gives him the camera.) I wanna be the on camera guy. All
right, first stop, Westminster Abbey. (Joey folds out his ""pop-up"" map of
London. All of the major landmarks pop-up like in a pop-up book.)"
69,Chandler," Oh, what the hell is that?"
70,Joey," It’s London, baby! All right, the hotel’s here. (Points to the
map.) Wait. No, we wanna go… No. I know. (Sets the map down.) I’m gonna have to
go into the map. (So Joey literally steps into the map.)"
71,Chandler," Okay, if you see a little version of me in there? Kill it!"
72,Joey, I got it! (Picks up the map and starts walking.) Here we go.
73,Chandler," Okay. Listen-listen, we’re not gonna have to walk this way the
entire time are we?"
74,Joey," Shhh! (Pause) Man, you made me lose it! (He goes into the map again.)"
77,Ross," Whoa-whoa-whoa! Emily, (Gives her the time-out signal.) honey, okay?"
79,Ross, What?! No! No! That’s-that’s time-out!
81,Ross," Sweetie, you gotta relax. Everything’s gonna be great, okay? Come on.
Come on."
82,Monica, Chicken Kiev?
83,Ross, Um-hmm! Doesn’t that sound delicious at the last minute?
84,Monica," Yeah, y’know, but something like salmon which would be so much more
elegant than the chicken. And, you wouldn’t have to worry about the salmonella. (Ross
pushes her.) So, I can’t wait to see this place you’re getting married!"
85,Ross," Yeah. Yeah. Yes, this place is beautiful. Emily’s parents got married
here."
87,Monica, It’s nice.
91,Ross, It’s all right! Everything’s gonna be all right.
93,Ross," Uh-huh, I see that."
94,Monica," (entering) Okay, I talked to the guy with the shovel and I found out
what happened. "
95,Ross, What? What?
96,Monica, They torn it down a few days early.
98,Joey," All right! Westminster Abbey! Hands down, best Abbey I’ve ever seen.
Hey! (Pushes Chandler in front of the camera.) Okay. What do you think of the Abbey,
Chandler?"
99,Chandler," I think it’s great. It’s great. Y’know, they’re
thinking of changing the name of this place."
100,Joey, Really? To what?
101,Chandler, To Put the Camera Away!!!
102,Joey," Man, you are Westminster Crabby. (He starts chasing Chandler
towards the Abbey.)"
104,Phoebe, Oh. Oh.
105,Rachel," Oh, honey! Don’t get up! What do you need?"
106,Phoebe," Oh, no. Oh, nothing."
107,Rachel, Come on! I am here to take care of you! What do you need? Anything.
108,Phoebe," Okay, I have a wedgie."
109,Rachel," Okay, that is all you."
110,Phoebe," So-so, what do you want for lunch?"
111,Rachel," Oh, I don’t know. I guess we have to eat."
112,Phoebe," Yeah, I do. What’s the matter?"
113,Rachel," I’m just bummed about the way I left things with Ross. I
shouldn’t have lied to him about having to work. He seemed so mad at me."
114,Phoebe," Eh, don’t be so hard on yourself. If someone I was still in love
with was getting married…"
115,Rachel, (interrupting) Still in love with?! 
116,Phoebe, Yeah!
117,Rachel, I’m not in love with Ross!
118,Phoebe," Oh. No. No. Good! Yeah, me neither."
119,Rachel," Phoebe, I’m going to Ross’s wedding because he is my
ex-boyfriend and that would be really uncomfortable. Not because, I’m still in
love with him! I mean, hey, y’know, I like Ross as much as the next guy, y’know?
Clearly I have feelings for him, but feelings don’t mean love! I mean, I still
have loving feelings for Ross. Yeah! But, I have, I have continuing feelings of love, but
that doesn’t mean that-that I’m still in love with him. Y’know? I-I have
sexual feelings for him, but I do love him—Ohh! Oh my God! Oh my—why
didn’t you tell me?!!"
120,Phoebe, We thought you knew!
121,Rachel, We?!
122,Phoebe," Yeah, we all know! We talk about it all the time!"
123,Rachel, You all know? Does Ross know?
124,Phoebe," Oh no, Ross doesn’t know anything."
125,Rachel," Oh, I can not believe you didn’t tell me!"
126,Phoebe," Well, because we thought you knew!! It’s so obvious! God, that
would be like telling Monica, ""Hey, you like things clean."""
128,Joey, Hey!
130,Joey," Check this out? Huh? (Joey has this big tall hat with a British flag on
the front of it.) Yeah. That’s the stuff. What do you think?"
131,Chandler," Well, I don’t have to buy that, ""I’m with stupid""
T-shirt anymore."
132,Joey," Well, I like it. Here you go. (He pays for the hat.)"
133,Chandler," All right, look, you’re not really gonna buy that are you?
Don’t you think you’ve embarrassed me enough for one day?"
134,Joey," Oh, I embarrass you? "
135,Chandler, How can I answer that when I’m pretending I don’t know you?
137,Chandler, Oh really? Then how come no one here is wearing them?
139,Chandler," All right, look, if you insist on wearing that, in public,
y’know, you’re gonna spend the rest of the afternoon all by yourself."
140,Joey," Oh yeah? (Puts the hat on.) If you’re gonna make me choose between
you and the hat? I choose the hat."
142,Joey, Thanks.
143,Chandler," Okay, wait. All right, that’s it, okay, I’m out of here. I
am not going to be embarrassed anymore! (He trips over a box, falls into a flower stand
and walks away trying to be cool.)"
146,Ross," Hey! I just spoke to your dad, and you know what? He seems to think
we’ll be able to find a new place for the wedding."
148,Ross, Whoa-whoa-what? You found a place?
150,Ross, She said what?
152,Ross," Postpone it? Emily, do you think Monica realises how much our parents
spent on this wedding? Do you my sister’s teeny-tiny little brain comprehends that
people took time out of their lives to fly thousands of miles to be here, huh? (He puts
his pants on backwards.) This isn’t right."
154,Ross," I can’t ask people to do that? Would you ask people to do that?
(Holds out his pants)"
156,Ross," The only thing I understand is; postponing it is not an option. This is
when we’re getting married."
158,Ross," No. I’m saying it’s now. (He starts putting on his pants,
backwards again.)"
160,Ross, There’s no ‘or’ in mind. What is wrong with these pants?!!
162,Ross," (chasing her, trying to zip up his pants. His got them on right now.) No,
wait! Emily! No, wait, stop! Emily, please—(He catches something important in the
zipper and howls like a little boy and falls to the floor.)"
165,Phoebe, Hey!
166,Rachel, (depressed) Hi.
167,Phoebe," So, did shopping make you feel any better about Ross?"
168,Rachel, Manhattan does not have enough stores.
169,Phoebe," Well, I think I can help you get over him."
170,Rachel, You can?
171,Phoebe, Yeah. I just need you to bring me some photos of Ross.
172,Rachel, Um-hmm.
173,Phoebe, And a small piece of chocolate.
174,Rachel, Okay.
175,Phoebe, And a glass of tepid water. (She gathers up all of these things.)
176,Rachel," Ooh, is this one of those things where you throw it in a bag with some
graveyard dirt and hang it from a north-facing tree?"
177,Phoebe," Uh, only if you have the hiccups too. Yeah, the pictures are for you,
the water and the chocolate is for me. I just didn’t feel like getting up. Okay,
I’m gonna show you a picture of Ross. Okay? And you’re going to remember all of
the bad things about him. All right? Really focus on his flaws."
178,Rachel, I can do that. I certainly did it when we were going out.
179,Phoebe," Okay. Umm, before we get started, I just wanna say for the record that I
love Ross, I think he’s such a great guy. Here. (Hands her the picture, Rachel grabs
it out of her hand.) Okay, now, close your eyes. And imagine that you’re with Ross
okay and imagine that you’re kissing him. And you’re-you’re running your
hands all over his body. And then you run your hands through his hair, but eew-oh gross
it’s some kind of grease, it’s—uck! Hah?"
180,Rachel," I don’t know, his uh, his hair never really bothered me that much,
and y’know it was always more crunchy than it was greasy."
181,Phoebe," Okay, this is going to be harder than I thought. Umm, let’s try
some uh, aversion therapy."
182,Rachel, Okay.
183,Phoebe, Okay?
184,Rachel, All right.
185,Phoebe," So uh, now look at the picture…"
186,Rachel, Okay.
187,Phoebe," All right, and umm… (She grabs the picture and smacks her in the
head.) "
188,Rachel, Ow!
189,Phoebe," Okay, how do you feel now?"
190,Rachel," Well, I like you less!"
192,Joey, Hey.
193,Chandler, Hey. (He nods at the hat.)
194,Joey, Oh. (Takes off the hat.) Sorry!
195,Chandler," No-no-no, y’know what? I really shouldn’t have said that you
were embarrassing me, I mean that really wasn’t cool. And if it makes you feel any
better, I’ve had a really lousy day."
196,Joey, Me too.
197,Chandler, Yeah?
198,Joey," Noo!! I’ve had the best day ever! Dude, check this out!"
199,Monica, (entering) Hey!
200,Joey, Sh-shh-shh! (He motions for her to watch something he has taped.)
202,Joey," (on tape) Okay, so say hi to my friend and tell him that you like the hat.
"
204,Joey," (on tape) Oh, Chandler."
206,Chandler, That’s… That’s was…
207,Monica, Oh my God!
208,Joey, That’s Fergie baby!!
210,Chandler, How did you? How? How?
211,Joey," Well, I was trying to figure out how to get to Buckingham Palace, right?
So, I’m in my map and-and…(Ross enters) Hey!"
212,Monica, Hey!
213,Ross, Hi. I understand you had a little talk with Emily.
214,Monica," (laughs) Yes, I did! And you are welcome!"
215,Ross, Am I?! And was it your idea to postpone the wedding?!
216,Monica, Umm…
217,Chandler, I’m gonna go to the bathroom.
218,Joey, Wait up! (They both run to the bathroom.)
219,Ross," Hey-hey, since you’re the ‘fix-it’ lady, here’s a
pickle, what do you do when the bride says she doesn’t want to have the wedding at
all?"
220,Monica, She said that?!
221,Ross, Yeah.
222,Monica, Why?!
223,Ross," I don’t know, I told her it was stupid to put off the wedding just
because the hall was gone and she liked flipped out."
224,Monica, Oh my God. You’re even dumber than I am!
225,Ross, Excuse me?
226,Monica," Ross, how long have you been planning this wedding?"
227,Ross, I don’t know. A month?
228,Monica," Emily has probably been planning it since she was five! Ever since the
first time she took a pillowcase and hung it off the back of her head. That’s what we
did! We dreamed about the perfect wedding, and the perfect place, with the perfect
four-tiered wedding cake (Starting to cry), with the little people on top. (Ross gets
thrown a box of Kleenex from the bathroom and he gives her one.) Thanks. But the most
important part is that we had the perfect guy who understood just how important all that
other stuff was."
229,Ross," I had no idea. And that-that pillowcase thing, I thought you guys were
just doing the flying nun."
230,Monica, Sometimes we were.
231,Ross, Come on. You gotta help me figure out what to do. Okay?
232,Monica, Okay.
233,Ross, Come on. (They leave and Chandler sticks his head out.)
234,Chandler, That was pretty intense huh?
235,Joey," Yeah. (Pause) Hey, I hope Ross didn’t think that we just went in
there because we were uncomfortable being out here!"
236,Chandler, (glares at him) I hope he did!
238,Phoebe, Hello.
239,Joey," (on phone) Hey, Pheebs! It’s Joey!"
240,Phoebe," Hey, Joey! Hey! Ooh! Ooh! I just say someone on the—that looks just
like you on the subway. And I was gonna go over and say ‘hi!’ but then I
figured, he doesn’t care if he looks like you."
241,Joey," That just cost me four bucks. But uh listen, I just called to see how the
chick and the duck are doing?"
242,Phoebe," Ohh, they’re having a great time with their Aunt Phoebe!
Aunt Rachel hasn’t been helpful at all. So, do you miss me?"
243,Joey," Kinda, but I’ve just been having way too much fun."
244,Phoebe, So you’re not homesick yet?
245,Joey," No, I don’t think so."
246,Phoebe," All right, the seven of us miss you."
247,Joey, Who’s seven?
248,Phoebe," Y’know, me, Rachel, the birds, the babies…"
249,Joey," Ahh, the babies miss me?"
251,Phoebe," Ooh, the pizza guy’s here!"
252,Joey, What? You ordered pizza without me?!
253,Phoebe," Yeah. But y’know we were thinking about you, y’know we ordered
the Joey Special."
254,Joey, Two pizzas?!
255,Phoebe," Yep! Okay, gotta go, talk to you later."
256,Joey," Wait, well, where did you get it from?! "
260,Monica, You’ll see.
264,Ross," Okay? But-but imagine a lot more lights, okay? And-and y’know fewer
bricks, and-and-and flowers, and candles…"
265,Monica," And the musicians, look, they can go over here (Points to a little
alcove), okay? And the chairs can face this way (Points), and… (Points to Ross) You
go."
266,Ross," But-but, if you don’t love this, we’ll do it in any other place
at any other time. Really, it’s fine, whatever you want."
268,Ross," And, I don’t know, if it starts to rain…"
270,Monica, Ohh. And I don’t even have a date.
272,Rachel, Pheebs?
273,Phoebe, Yeah?
274,Rachel, Do you remember where the duck food is?
275,Phoebe," Yeah, it’s in the guys’ apartment under the sink. Why?"
276,Rachel, (enters with a bag packed) Because I’m going to London.
277,Phoebe, What?! What do you mean you’re going to London?
278,Rachel," Yeah, I have to tell Ross that I love him. Now honey, you take care, you
don’t have those babies until I get back. (Kisses her stomach.) "
279,Phoebe," I—Rachel, you can’t go! Ross loves Emily!"
280,Rachel," Yeah, I know, I know, I know he does. But I have to tell him how I feel!
He deserves to have all the information and then he can make an informed decision."
281,Phoebe," That’s not why you’re going! You’re going because you
hope he’s gonna say, ""Yeah, I love you too, Rach. Forget that British
chippy."""
282,Rachel, Ohh—Do you think he will?!
283,Phoebe," No! Because he’s in love with the British chippy! Look, Rachel, if
you go, you’re just gonna mess with his head and ruin his wedding! Y’know,
it’s too late! You missed you’re chance! I’m sorry, I know this must be
really hard, it’s over."
284,Rachel," Y’know what? No. It’s not over until someone says, ""I
do."" (Exits)"
285,Phoebe," I do! I do! I do! (Chases her into the hall, but Rachel doesn’t
stop.) I do! (Gives up.) Ugh, like I can really chase you. I’m carrying a litter."
289,Phoebe, Oh...yes..is this..umm..Emily’s Parents’ house.

3,Ross," Take thee, Rachel...(All his friends have looks of shock on their faces.
He realizes what he said. Quickly he says.) Emily. (A slight chuckle.) Emily."
5,Rachel," (To the woman sitting in front of her) He-he said Rachel, right? Do you
think I should go up there?"
8,Ross," I, Ross…"
10,Ross," Take thee, (Glares at the Minister) Emily. (Chuckles) Like
there’d be anybody else. (Emily is glaring at him.)"
12,Ross," As my lawfully wedded wife, in sickness and in health, until death parts
us. Really, I do. Emily. (Points at her.)"
14,Ross, Happy too.
16,Ross, Yay!
22,Ross, Okay.
23,Joey," Well, that went well. Yeah."
24,Chandler," It could’ve been worse, he could’ve shot her."
26,Ross," (laughs) That uh, that was pretty funny. Wasn’t it?"
31,Joey," (To the gang) Hey, no matter what happens with Ross and Emily, we still
get cake right?"
32,Ross," (exiting the bathroom) That-that-that’s all right, no honey, you take
your time sweetie. I’ll be right out here. (She slams the door in his face, to the
gang) She’s just fixing her makeup."
34,Ross," And, I love you!! (He walks into the living room)"
36,Ross," That’s true, thanks dad. (To All) People should be dancing! Huh? Hey,
this is a party! Come on! Joey, dance!! (He starts to dance but stops when no one else
joins him.)"
39,Phoebe," (On the phone, in New York) Uh, hello, this is Ross Geller’s
personal physician, Dr. Philange."
41,Phoebe," Yeah, I’ve discovered that Ross forgot to take his brain medicine,
uh, now without it, uh, in the brain of Ross, uh women’s names are interchangeable,
through-through no fault of his own."
43,Phoebe," No, not Phoebe, Dr. Philange. Oh no! You have it too!"
45,Phoebe, Hello?
47,Chandler, Hey.
48,Monica, Hey.
49,Chandler," Oh wow, I hope you don’t take this the wrong way but, I know we
had plans to meet up tonight and, ugh, I’m just kinda worried about what it might do
to our friendship."
50,Monica, I know. How could we have let this happen?
51,Chandler, Seven times!
52,Monica," Ugh! Well, y’know, we were away…"
53,Chandler," In a foreign, romantic country…"
54,Monica, I blame London.
55,Chandler, Bad London! (Takes a spoon and smacks the turkey.)
56,Monica," So look umm, while we’re st-still in London, I mean, we can keep
doing it right?"
57,Chandler," Well, I don’t see that we have a choice. But, when we’re
back home, we don’t do it."
58,Monica, Only here.
59,Chandler," Y’know, I saw a wine cellar downstairs…"
60,Monica, I’ll meet you there in two minutes.
61,Chandler, Okay! 
63,Rachel," Mon, honey, I gotta ask you something."
64,Monica, (impatiently) Now?
65,Rachel," Ross said my name up there, I mean, come on, I just can’t pretend
that didn’t happen can I?"
66,Monica," Oh, I-I don’t know."
67,Rachel," Monica, what should I do?"
68,Monica," Just uh, do the right thing. (Uses some breath spray)"
69,Rachel, What?
70,Monica," Toe the line. Thread the needle. Think outside the box! (Tries to leave,
but is stopped by Rachel.)"
71,Rachel," Whoa, wait, listen, I think I’m just gonna talk to Ross about what
he think it meant."
72,Monica," Wait. Rachel, no, he’s married. Married! If you don’t realize
that, I can’t help you."
73,Rachel," Okay, you’re right. You’re right. You can’t help me."
78,Joey," Hey, what’s up? (He has solved the problem of eating the steak,
he’s eating it with his hands.)"
80,Monica, Where were you? We were supposed to meet in the wine cellar?
81,Chandler," Forget it, that’s off."
82,Monica, Why?!
85,Monica," Joey, what are you doing? You promised Phoebe you wouldn’t eat meat
until she has the babies!"
86,Joey," Well, I figured we’re in another country, so it doesn’t count."
87,Monica, That’s true.
88,Chandler, The man’s got a point.
90,Rachel," Oh, hi!"
91,Ross, Hi!
92,Rachel," Hi. Sorry, things aren’t working out so well."
93,Ross," Oh no! It could be better, but it’s gonna be okay, right?"
94,Rachel," Oh yeah! Of course, I mean, she’s gonna get over this, y’know?
I mean, so you said my name! Y’know you just said it ‘cause you saw me there, if
you’d have seen a circus freak, you would’ve said, ""I take thee circus
freak."" Y’know, it didn’t mean anything, it’s just a mistake. It
didn’t mean anything. Right?"
95,Ross," No! No! Of course it didn’t mean anything! I mean, uh well, I can
understand why Emily would think it meant something, y’know, because-because it was
you…"
96,Rachel, Right…
97,Ross," But it absolutely didn’t. (Yelling towards the bathroom) It
didn’t!! It didn’t!!"
98,Joey," (approaching) Ross, hey, the band’s ready outside for your first
dance with Emily, so…"
99,Ross," (sarcastic) Oh! Oh-oh, the band’s ready! Well, I-I-we gotta do what
the band says—I don’t care about the stupid band!!"
100,Joey, You spit on me man! (Wipes his face.)
101,Ross," Look, I’m sorry."
102,Joey," Emily is kinda taking a long time, huh?"
103,Rachel," (laughs) Y’know when I locked myself in the bathroom at my wedding,
it was because I was trying to pop the window out of the frame."
104,Ross," Oh, right!"
105,Rachel," Get the hell out of there, y’know?"
107,Ross," (Bangs on the bathroom door) Emily? Emily? I’m coming in. (He opens
the door to reveal that the window is gone, along with Emily.)"
108,Rachel," Well, look at that, same thing."
110,Chandler," Listen, in the middle of everything if I scream the word,
""Yippee!"" just ignore me."
112,Monica," Oh my God, Rachel! Hi!"
113,Chandler," Oh, hello Rachel."
114,Rachel," Ross said my name. Okay? My name. Ross said my name up there that
obviously means that he still loves me! (They both just stare at her.) Okay, don’t
believe me, I know I’m right—do you guys want to go downstairs and get a drink?"
115,Chandler," Yes, we do. But, we have to change first."
116,Monica," Yes, I want to change. And why-why don’t you go down and get us a
table?"
117,Chandler," Yeah, we’ll be down in like five minutes."
118,Monica, (elbows him) Fifteen minutes.
119,Rachel, Okay.
121,Rachel," Hello? Oh, Pheebs! (To them) It’s Phoebe!"
122,Chandler," Oh, yay…"
123,Monica, Great…
124,Rachel, Hi!
125,Phoebe," Hi, so what happened?"
126,Rachel," Well, Ross said my name."
127,Phoebe," Yeah, I know, but I don’t think that means anything."
128,Rachel," Okay, Pheebs, y’know what, let’s look at this objectively all
right? Ninth grade, right? The obsession starts. All right? The summer after ninth grade
he sees me in a two-piece for the first time, his obsession begins to grow. So then…"
129,Chandler," (To Monica) Hey, listen, why don’t we go change in my room?"
130,Monica, But my clothes are—ohh! (They both leave.)
132,Chandler," Wow, you look…"
133,Monica, No time for that!
135,Joey," Hey, dude, let me in. I got a girl out here!"
136,Chandler," Well, I’ve got a girl in here."
137,Joey," No you don’t, I just saw you go in there with Monica!"
138,Chandler," Well, we’re-we’re hanging out in here!"
139,Joey," Look, which one of us is gonna be having sex in there, me or you?"
140,Chandler," Well, I suppose I’d have to say you!! But, what if we’re
watching a movie in here?"
141,Monica," Which we are, and-and we already paid for it. It’s My Giant!"
142,Joey, My Giant? I love that movie!
144,Monica, You really think this is okay?
145,Chandler," Well, Ross and Emily aren’t gonna use it."
146,Monica," Oh, it’s so beautiful. Ohh! Y’know, I-I don’t know if I
feel right about this."
147,Chandler," Oh Mon-Mon-Mon-Mon-look, this is the honeymoon suite. The room
expects sex. The room would be disappointed if it didn’t get sex. All of the
other honeymoon suites would think it was a loser."
148,Monica, Okay!
149,Chandler, Okay!
151,Ross, (entering) Emily?!
152,Chandler," Nope, not under here!"
153,Monica, You didn’t find her?
154,Ross," No, I’ve looked everywhere!"
155,Chandler," Well, you couldn’t have looked everywhere or else you
would’ve found her!"
156,Monica," Yeah, I think you should keep looking!"
157,Chandler," Yeah, for about 30 minutes."
158,Monica, Or 45.
159,Chandler," Wow, in 45 minutes you can find her twice. (Monica smiles at that.)"
160,Ross," No! For all I know, she’s trying to find me but couldn’t because
I kept moving around. No, from now on, I’m staying in one place. (He sits down on the
bed.) Right here."
161,Monica," Well, it’s getting late."
162,Chandler," Yeah, we’re gonna go."
163,Ross," Actually, do you guys mind staying here for a while?"
164,Monica," Ugh, y’know, umm we gotta get up early and catch that plane for New
York."
165,Chandler," Yeah, it’s a very large plane."
166,Ross, (disappointed) That’s cool.
167,Chandler," But, we’ll stay here with you."
168,Ross," Thanks guys! (They both sit down on either side of him.) I really
appreciate this, y’know, but you don’t have to rub my butt."
172,Chandler, We have to leave for New York in an hour.
173,Monica," I know, I’ve been looking at those doors, they look pretty sound
proof, don’t you think?"
174,Chandler," We can’t do that that’s insane. I mean ‘A’ he
could wake up and ‘B’ y’know, let’s go for it."
176,Ross," Em-Emily? (Looking around for her.) Em-Emily? (He runs to the door.)
Emily! (He opens the door to reveal the Walthams standing outside.)"
180,Ross," Wait, well wh-wh-wh-where is she?"
185,Rachel," (entering, carrying an armful of those little soaps.) Hey-hey, you guys
oh hurry up, get some, there’s a whole cart outside… (Sees the Walthams and
stops.)"
187,Ross," Now, hold on! Hold on! (Stops him) Look, look, your daughter and I are
supposed to leave tonight for our honeymoon, now-now you-you tell her that I’m gonna
be at that airport and I hope that she’ll be there too! Oh yeah, I said Rachel’s
name, but it didn’t mean anything, Okay? She’s-she’s just a friend and
that’s all! (Rachel sits down, depressed.) That’s all! Now just tell Emily that
I love her and that I can’t imagine spending my life with anyone else. Please,
promise me that you’ll tell her that."
192,Monica," Y’know, maybe it’s best that we never got to do it again."
193,Chandler," Yeah, it kinda makes that-that one night special. (Realizes something)
Y’know, technically we still are over international waters."
194,Monica," I’m gonna go to the bathroom, maybe I’ll see you there in a
bit?"
195,Chandler, ‘Kay!
197,Joey, Can I ask you something?
198,Chandler," Uhh, no."
199,Joey," Felicity and I, we’re watching My Giant, and I was thinking,
""I’m never gonna be as good an actor as that giant."" Do you think I’m
just wasting my life with this acting thing?"
200,Chandler, No.
201,Joey," I mean, the giant is like five years younger than me, y’know, you
think I’ll ever get there?"
202,Chandler, Yes.
203,Joey, Thanks man. 
204,Chandler, Okay man. (Chandler starts to get up.)
205,Joey, But what about how much taller he is than me?
207,Joey," I mean, there’s no way I can make myself taller now, y’know? And
who knows what science will come up with in the future, but Chandler, what if I die an
unsuccessful, regular sized man?"
209,Joey," Hey, Monica, wow you’ve been in the bathroom for like a half-hour."
210,Monica, I know!
211,Joey," Had the beef-tips, huh?"
213,Phoebe, Hey!
214,Chandler, Hey!
215,Joey, Hi!
217,Phoebe," (To Joey) You ate meat! (Joey is shocked) (To Chandler and Monica) You
had sex! (They’re shocked.)"
218,Chandler, No we didn’t!
219,Phoebe," I know you didn’t, I was talking about Monica."
220,Monica," Phoebe, I did not have sex."
221,Phoebe, This pregnancy is throwing me all off.
222,Joey," All right, I’m gonna go say hi the chick and the duck."
223,Phoebe," Oh, me too!"
224,Joey," Why would you need to say hi to them, you’ve been feeding them for
four days?"
225,Phoebe," Oh right, maybe I’ll just go home. "
227,Monica," Well, we certainly are alone."
228,Chandler," Yes! Good thing we have that, ‘Not in New York’ rule."
229,Monica," Right. Umm, listen since we’re-we-re on that subject, umm, I just
wanted to tell you that uh, well, I-I was going through a really hard time in London, what
with my brother getting married and that guy thinking I was Ross’s mother…"
230,Chandler, Right.
231,Monica," Well, an-anyway, I just—that night meant a lot to me, I guess
I’m just trying to say thanks."
232,Chandler," Oh. Y’know, that night meant a lot to me too, and it wasn’t
because I was in a bad place or anything, it just meant a lot to me ‘cause,
you’re really hot! Is that okay?"
233,Monica, (laughs) That’s okay.
234,Chandler, And I’m cute too.
235,Monica, And you’re cute too.
236,Chandler," Thank you! (They hug.) All right, I gotta go unpack."
237,Monica, Okay.
238,Chandler, Bye. 
240,Chandler," (entering) I’m still on London time, does that count?"
241,Monica, That counts!
242,Chandler," Oh, good! (They start kissing.)"
244,Ross, Rach! Rach!
245,Rachel, (she stops and turns) Hi!
246,Ross," Hi! What are you, what are you doing here?"
247,Rachel," Well, I-I-I’ve been on Standby for a flight home for hours. "
248,Ross, Oh.
249,Rachel," Ohh, so no sign of Emily huh?"
250,Ross, Not yet.
251,Rachel," So umm, what time are you supposed to leave?"
253,Ross, Pretty soon I guess.
254,Rachel, Yeah. I’m sorry.
255,Ross," I just, I don’t understand, I mean, how-how can she do this?
Y’know, what, am I, am I like a complete idiot for thinking that she’d actually
show up?"
256,Rachel," No, you’re not an idiot, Ross. You’re a guy very much in love."
257,Ross, Same difference.
259,Ross," I get it! Well, that’s that."
260,Rachel," No, you know what, I think you should go."
261,Ross, What?
262,Rachel," Yeah, I do. I think you should go, by yourself, get some distance, clear
your head, I think it’d be really good."
263,Ross," Oh, I don’t, I don’t, I don’t know…"
264,Rachel," Oh, come on Ross! I think it would be really good for you!"
265,Ross," I could, yeah, I can do that."
266,Rachel, Yeah.
267,Ross," I can’t, I can’t even believe her! No, y’know what, I am, I
am gonna go!"
268,Rachel, Good!
269,Ross," I know, why not?"
270,Rachel, Right!
271,Ross, Right?
272,Rachel, Right!
273,Ross, Y’know—thanks! (They hug)
274,Rachel," Okay, I’ll see you back at home, if I ever get a flight out of
here."
275,Ross," Yeah, well…nah."
276,Rachel," What? Wait, what?"
277,Ross," Why don’t you come, I mean, I-I have two tickets, why not?"
278,Rachel," Well-well, I don’t know Ross—really?"
279,Ross," Yeah, yeah, it’ll be great! You can, you can lay on the beach and I
can cry over my failed marriage. See-see how I make jokes?"
280,Rachel, Uh-huh.
281,Ross," No really, I mean, I mean, God, I could use a friend."
282,Rachel," Oh wow, uh okay, uh maybe. Umm, yes, I can do that!"
283,Ross, Okay!
284,Rachel, Okay!
285,Ross, Cool!
286,Rachel, All right!
287,Ross," Come on! (They go to the jetway, Ross hands the tickets to the gate
agent.) Here. "
288,Rachel," Oh, okay, we’re going. Yeah."
289,Ross, Ah! Ah! I forgot my jacket!
290,Rachel," Oh, wait-wait-wait…"
291,Ross, You tell them to wait!
292,Rachel, Okay. Wait! Wait!
294,Ross, Emily.
296,Ross," Oh no-no-no! Oh-no! (Emily starts to run out and Ross chases her.) No! No!
Emily!"
299,Rachel," Ahh, yes, I will have a glass of the Merlot and uh, (points to
Ross’s seat.) he will have a white wine spritzer. Woo! (Looks out the window.) Hey,
look at that, the airport’s moving. (Realizes that that’s not how it works.)
Hey, are we moving?! Are we moving? Why are we moving? Hey, time-out, umm, yeah, does the
captain know that we’re moving? (Sits back in defeat.) Oh my God. Oh, my gosh."
0,Monica, You look cute in bubbles.
1,Chandler," Ehh, you're just liquored up."
3,Joey," Hey, it's me! I'm comin' in!"
5,Chandler," I've had a very long, hard day."
6,Joey," Ahh, I'm gonna go get some chicken. Want some?"
7,Chandler," Ahh, no thanks. No chicken, bye-bye then."
8,Joey, Okay.
10,Joey, You sure? Some extra crispy? Dirty rice? Beans?
11,Chandler," For the last time no! Get out! Get out, Joey!"
12,Joey, All right!
14,Chandler," Are you okay? I'm so sorry, he wouldn't leave. He kept asking me about
chicken."
15,Monica, Chicken? I could eat some chicken.
16,Chandler, Hey Joe!
18,Chandler," Yeah, can I get a 3-piece, some cole slaw, some beans, and a
Coke-(Yelps in "
23,Phoebe, (entering) Hey!
24,Chandler," Hey, Pheebs!"
25,Joey, Mornin' Pheebs!
26,Phoebe," I have to tell you this story. Okay, I was coming over here and this
driver…"
27,Joey, (interrupting) Was his name Angus? (Monica and Chandler laugh.)
28,Phoebe, What?
29,Joey," Oh, he was this cab driver we had in London."
30,Phoebe," Oh. Ha-ha-ha. All right, anyway…"
31,Monica," Wait, what that place, that pub he took us too?"
32,Chandler," Uh, The Wheatsheaf."
33,Joey," Yeah-yeah-yeah, and they had that beer! That uh…"
34,Monica, Bodington's!
36,Chandler," Ooh! Ahh, Pheebs, was gonna tell a story."
37,Phoebe," Yeah, so, he had a really funny hat—I don't want to talk about it."
38,Ross, (entering) Hey!
40,Joey," Hey, Ross, Bodington's!"
41,Ross, Yeah! (They high-five.)
42,Joey, That was good beer.
43,Ross, Ohh…
44,Joey," Y'know, I'd walk back to London for another frosty one of those bad
boys."
45,Ross," Y'know, I think they have those at that British pub near the trade center."
46,Joey, Later! (Exits.)
47,Ross, Isn't Rachel supposed to be back by now?
48,Monica," Yeah, but her plane got delayed in Athens. But actually, (Checks watch)
she should be here by now."
49,Ross," Oh, so-so you talked to her. Did she, did she sound mad?"
50,Monica," No, but she likes me. You abandoned her on a plane to Greece."
51,Ross," Okay, I did not abandon Rachel! Okay? Emily showed up at the
airport! I had to go after her! I mean, I-I did what I had to do! She's my wife!
Rachel is my wife! Y'know—Emily! Emily, is my wife! Man, what is that?"
52,Phoebe, So you still hadn't heard from Emily?
53,Ross," No, not since I lost her at the airport."
54,Chandler, I can't believe she can out run you man!
55,Ross," HEY, SHE'S FAST!! OKAY?!! (Chandler is so shocked at Ross's
outburst that he drops his spoon and backs up) Oh! You-you think you can be beat
me? Let's go! Outside!!"
56,Rachel, (entering) Hi!
58,Ross," Rach, Rach, I am so sorry. I am so-so sorry."
59,Rachel," Oh Ross, come on! You just did what you had to do."
60,Ross," That's it? You're not mad? I mean, it must've been terrible."
61,Rachel," Terrible? Hell, I was in Greece! That was a nice hotel! Nice beach, met
the nice people. Not to shabby for Rachel. (Goes and puts her luggage away.)"
62,Ross," So, what? That's it?"
63,Rachel," Well, yeah! We're cool. Totally cool."
64,Ross," Oh, thanks. Oh, you're the best. (They hug.)"
65,Rachel," Oh no, you're the best."
66,Ross," (breaking the hug) Ohh, I gotta go to the flower store! (Runs to the
door.) Check it out, no one will tell me where Emily is, so I'm gonna send 72 long-stem,
red roses to Emily's parent's house, one for each day that I've known and loved her. That
oughta get her talking to me again."
67,Chandler," Oh, Ross, when you make out card; be sure to make it out to, EM-I-LY."
69,Monica," Rach, that's great! It's so good that you had a good time in Greece!"
70,Rachel," What?! I didn't have a good time in Greece! Ross abandoned me! Okay, I
couldn't get a plane out, so I had to stay in their honeymoon suite with people coming up
to me all the time going, ""Oh, Mrs. Geller, why are you crying?"" I mean, it was
sooo humiliating. I felt like such an idiot! I mean, it's all my fault! And you know why,
because I make very bad decisions."
71,Chandler, Oh that's not true.
72,Rachel," Yes it is! It is true! I went, I went after Ross in stupid London."
73,Phoebe, London is stupid! Stupid!
74,Rachel," Phoebe, you were right. I should've never gone to London, and from now
on you make all of my decisions for me."
75,Phoebe," Oh… No, I did that for someone once and I'm not comfortable having
that kind of power and control over someone's life."
76,Monica, I'll do it!
77,Rachel," That's fine. So Monica, you are now in control of my love life."
78,Chandler," Okay, I gotta go to work."
80,Chandler," And uh, Rachel, glad to have you back. "
82,Chandler," Pheebs! (He goes over and kisses Phoebe, who is also stunned.) Always
a pleasure. (And he struts out leaving the girls to stare at each other.)"
84,Monica," Oh, Rachel, sweetie, look, here's a really cute picture of Joey and you
at the reception."
85,Rachel," Ohh, he's married! Ross is married. I can't—I still can't believe
it. (Rachel grabs the picture from Monica)"
86,Monica," Honey, sweetie, by the edges."
87,Rachel," I mean, y'know I'm just gonna have to accept it (She grabs the rest of
the pictures)…"
88,Monica, Ohh. (Monica covers her eyes in horror.)
89,Rachel, …I mean it's my fault.
90,Monica, Sweetie! Edges! Fingers! Smudgey! Pictures!
91,Rachel, Oh my God! (She licks the top picture and hands them back.)
92,Monica," Okay. That's okay. I-I know that you're very upset right now. I know, I
know that wasn't about me."
93,Joey, (To Chandler) I bet it was about her a little.
94,Monica," If you would stop thinking about Ross for one minute you would notice
that there are great guys everywhere! I mean, look! Look, Gunther! (Gunther turns to
listen in.) I mean, he's nice, he's cute."
95,Rachel," Yeah, I guess Gunther is kinda…"
96,Monica," (Interrupting) Oh, what about that guy over there? (She points at
another guy and Gunther is deflated.) Remember? That is the guy you flirted with at
the counter that time."
97,Rachel," Oh, I don't know. I don't know."
98,Monica," You're going to talk to him! Y'know what? We made a deal, I make your
decisions and I say you're going to talk to him."
99,Rachel," All right, you're the boss. I guess I gotta do what you tell me."
100,Joey, Say that to him and you're golden. (She just glares at him.)
101,Phoebe, (entering) Hey!
102,Rachel, Hey!
103,Joey," Hey, Pheebs!"
104,Monica," We got out pictures back from London. (Shows her one.) Here's all of us
at the Tower of London."
105,Phoebe," (Grabs the pictures) Oh! Here we all are! Yeah, there's Ross and
Joey and you and me. (She picks up a magic marker and draws herself in. Monica can't
watch.)"
106,Chandler," All right, y'know what, we've been talking about London too much
haven't we?"
107,Phoebe," No. I'm sorry. It's just 'cause I couldn't be there. 'Cause all I ever
get to do now is pregnant stuff, it just bums me out."
110,Monica, What happened?
111,Rachel," Well, y'know, a little of this, a little of that. Got myself a date
tomorrow night."
112,Monica," See, didn't I tell you?! You're getting over Ross already!"
113,Rachel, Well…
117,Monica, What took you so long?
118,Chandler," I got caught up and work, but I'm quitting tomorrow."
119,Monica," Oh, good. "
121,Chandler," So, thanks for having me over! Rach. (Goes over, grabs her, and kisses
her.) Pheebs. (After a moment while he decides how to kiss her around her belly, grabs her
and kisses her.)"
122,Joey, (Jumping out of his way) See ya!! (To the girls.) What the hell was that?!
123,Monica," Probably some y'know, European good-bye thing he picked up in London."
124,Rachel, That's not European!
125,Phoebe," Well, it felt French."
128,Rachel," Oh God, I really had a good time!"
130,Rachel," Yeah. Umm, unless you wanna come inside?"
132,Rachel," Okay. Oh, uh, wait a minute, y'know what? I uh, I can't decide this.
Umm, okay, just hold on a second."
135,Rachel," Umm, hi!"
136,Ross, Hi.
137,Rachel, Is Monica around? I-I have to ask her something.
138,Ross, She's doing her laundry.
139,Rachel, What's that? (Points to the box.)
140,Ross," It came in the mail today, it's uh, 72 long-stemmed red roses, one for
each day that I've known and loved Emily, cut up into mulch!"
141,Rachel," Oh, honey that's awful."
142,Ross," Oh, it's not so bad. Monica's gonna make potpourri! I think I'm gonna go
wander out in the rain for a while."
143,Rachel," But, it's not raining."
144,Ross, I can't catch a break!
145,Rachel," Y'know what Ross? You're not going anywhere. You're gonna sit right
here. I'm gonna make you a cup of tea and we're gonna talk this thing whole out. All
right? (She goes out to talk to Dave) Hey, Dave!"
147,Rachel," Umm, listen, I'm gonna need to take a rain check, my roommate is just
really sick. Okay? Bye! (She goes back in to talk to Ross.) Honey, listen, I know, I know
things seem so bad right now."
148,Monica," (Poking her head in) Rach? Can I talk to for just a minute? I-I dropped
some socks."
149,Rachel," Yeah. (She goes out to join her in the hall and starts looking for the
dropped socks.)"
150,Monica," What is the matter with you?! Do you want to fall into the trap? Do you
want to fall into the trap?!"
151,Rachel, Ohh! You did not drop any socks!
152,Monica," I just ran into Dave and he told me that you blew him off! I mean, you
listen to me! Now, I'm calling the shots! I say you leave Ross alone and go get Dave! What
the hell were you trying to do?"
153,Rachel," Well, ultimately, I was trying y'know, I-I wanted…tell him y'know,
that I'm still in love with him."
154,Monica, (Gasps) What?!! You cannot tell him that!!
155,Rachel, Why? Why not?! People love to hear that!
156,Monica," I make the decisions, and I say no."
157,Rachel," Well, y'know what, no, you do not make my decisions because y'know what,
you're fired."
158,Monica," You can't fire me. I make your decisions and I say,
""I'm not fired!"" Ha!"
159,Rachel," Well… (At a loss for words, she grabs some of Monica's laundry and
throws it on the floor as a diversion to allow Rachel to run back inside and close the
door. Monica chases her to find that Rachel had locked the door.)"
160,Monica, Rachel!! Come on! Let me in!
161,Joey, (Poking his head out.) Havin' some trouble?
162,Monica, Rachel locked the door.
163,Joey, I'll kick that door in if you give me a little sugar.
166,Monica, Rachel! Let me in! Rachel!
168,Monica," Thank you. Rachel, can I talk to you outside for a sec?"
169,Rachel, No.
170,Monica, I really need to talk to you.
171,Rachel," Well, then talk!"
172,Monica," Okay, I will. Remember that thing that we just discussed that you wanted
to do?"
173,Rachel, Yes!
174,Ross, What thing?
175,Monica," Well, Rachel wants to take swing dance lessons. Which I think is a
really stupid idea! It's dangerous, she's never gonna get what she wants, and who knows
who she might (Turns to look at Ross) end up hurting."
176,Ross," Monica's right, swing dancing can be tricky. I'm gonna use the phone. I
gotta cancel those five giant teddy bears I sent to Emily. (Looks at the rose mulch.) My
God, think of the massacre."
177,Rachel, I'm gonna do it.
178,Monica," All right, Rachel, I know-I know you think I'm crazy, please, before you
tell him you love him, just-just try to find one person who thinks this is a good idea.
Because I bet you, you can't."
179,Rachel, But I…
180,Monica, Please!
181,Rachel," All right, fine."
183,Monica," Joey, I'm in!"
184,Joey, (In tremendous pain) All right. Good deal.
187,Joey," Uh, okay, Pheebs?"
188,Phoebe, Yeah?
189,Joey," Umm, y'know how the other day you were talking about how you didn't get to
go to London and how you were kinda feeling left out?"
190,Phoebe, Yeah?
191,Joey," All right, well, we felt really bad about that so we decided we should all
take a little trip together!"
192,Phoebe," Ohh, that's so nice! How great! Well, where? Where's the trip?!"
193,Monica," Well, we thought we would all go to a picnic (Phoebe gasps), in Central
Park!"
194,Phoebe, (excited) Central…(not so excited) Park!
195,Joey," Yeah, all of us! All day!"
196,Phoebe," That sucks! That's not a trip! I just came from the park! What are we
gonna high five about at the stupid Central Park? ""Well, it's right by my house, all
right!"" "
197,Chandler," Well, I'm gonna go home and bask in the triumph of my Central Park
idea. (Gets up to leave.)"
198,Rachel," (stopping him) Hey-whoa-whoa-whoa!! Ho-ho-hold on a sec there, Mr.
Kissey! Y'know, I've been meaning to talk to you about this whole, little, new European
thing you got going on, and I just need to tell you that it makes me very uncomfortable
and I just—y'know—stop it!"
199,Chandler, I was just trying to bring a little culture to the group.
200,Phoebe," That's fine, just don't bring it in my mouth."
201,Monica," Makes me wanna puke! (Chandler looks at her, quizzically.) "
203,Ross," Hey everybody, Pheebs is here!"
204,Joey, Phoebe!
205,Chandler," Hey, Pheebs!"
206,Rachel," Phoebe, woo!"
207,Phoebe," Okay, woo! Hi."
208,Chandler," Okay, Pheebs, we decided the picnic idea was a little… Y'know, it
didn't have any… It-it, well it blew. So, we thought, that this afternoon that we
would all go away for the whole weekend to, Atlantic City!"
209,Phoebe," Ooh, Atlantic City! Oh, that's a great plan! Who's plan was that?"
210,Joey, Mine!
211,Ross, Wait! It was my plan.
212,Joey," Nooo, I said we needed a new plan."
213,Ross," And, I came up with Atlantic City."
214,Joey," Which, is the new plan!"
215,Monica," Okay, well, why don't we all meet upstairs in an hour?"
216,Phoebe," Okay! Ooh-ahh, I'm gonna go pack. I'm gonna go pack my ass off!"
218,Monica," Come on Rach, let's go."
219,Rachel," Yeah, y'know what? I'm-I'm gonna meet you upstairs in a minute."
220,Monica," No! Rachel, you didn't find anyone so you can't tell him."
221,Rachel," Well, y'know what, that doesn't matter."
222,Monica," Okay, Rachel, do you have any idea how painful it is to tell someone
that you love them and not have them say it back?"
223,Rachel," Yeah, I-I don't care."
224,Monica, Okay. I-I can't watch. (Leaves as sits down to read the paper.)
225,Rachel, What 'cha readin'?
226,Ross, The paper.
227,Rachel," Yeah, what's it about?"
228,Ross, Events from around the globe.
229,Rachel," Okay. Uhh, Ross, y'know what, there's something that I-that I have to
talk to you about and everybody's saying that I shouldn't tell you, but I think they're
wrong. I mean, and you know how people can be wrong."
230,Ross," Sure. Once, at work I-I thought carbon dating was fossilized…"
231,Rachel," Okay, Ross, I'm really trying to tell you something here."
232,Ross, Yeah. 
233,Rachel, Okay.
234,Ross, Go ahead.
235,Rachel," Umm, okay, I think I'm-I'm just gonna-just gonna say it. Just gonna say
it. Uhh, (pause) I'm still in love with you Ross."
237,Ross, Wow. Umm… Huh… I'm-I'm not sure what to do with that right now.
239,Ross, What? What? Was that a joke? 'Cause it's mean.
240,Rachel, (Laughing) I'm so dead serious. I'm totally serious.
241,Ross, Why are you laughing?
242,Rachel," Because (laughs), because, I just heard it. I heard it, and it's
ridiculous! I mean, you're married. You're-you're married and it's just ridiculous, and
it's like, it's like when said it, I sort of like, I floated up out of my body, y'know?
And, and-and then I heard myself say it and then the floating Rachel (laughs) was like,
""You are such an idiot!"""
243,Ross," Well, well I am married. Even though I haven't spoken to my wife
since the wedding."
244,Rachel," (laughs) I'm sorry, that's not funny."
245,Ross," Actually, it kinda is. My wife won't return my calls. I don't know where
my wife is. (Laughs) ""Hey Ross, where's the Mrs.?"" Don't know! "
246,Rachel," Oh God, ohh, okay, y'know what, do you think ah, do you think that you
just forget that I told you this?"
247,Ross," Well, I kinda half to. I mean, because the thing is…"
248,Rachel," The thing is y'know, that you're married to Emily."
249,Ross, That is what the thing is.
250,Rachel," Ross, things aren't gonna be weird between us, right? I mean was that
just the stupidest thing, me telling you that?"
251,Ross," No. No. No, I'm-I'm glad you did. Look, if nothing else, it's-it's always
great when someone tells you they love you."
252,Rachel, That's what I said! Thank you for being so nice. (They hug.)
253,Ross, No thank you for… Thank you.
255,Ross," Okay, let's go!"
256,Chandler, Atlantic City!
257,Phoebe," Atlantic City, baby! Let's roll some bones! Hey Joey, high-five for
rolling bones! "
259,Joey," Uh, Pheebs, you're leaking?"
260,Monica, Oh my God! You're water broke!
262,Phoebe," All right. Well, don't worry, I call shotgun! (She starts out the door.)"
264,Chandler, Pheebs! We have to take you to the hospital now!
265,Ross," Pheebs, Pheebs, the babies are coming now."
266,Rachel," High-five, the babies are coming! (They all high-five.)"
267,Phoebe," Wait, wait, remember when my water broke? (They all high-five again.)"
270,Monica, I can't believe Phoebe's gonna have her babies!
271,Chandler," I know, it's beautiful. Amazing."
273,Chandler," Y'know what else I can't believe? I had to kiss Phoebe and Rachel
every time I left a room, I mean it's too bad they didn't see us having sex."
274,Monica, Do you know anything about women?
275,Chandler, No.
276,Monica, That's all right. 
277,Chandler, Okay. (They kiss again.)
0,Phoebe, (to the nurse) Hi.
2,Phoebe," Hi, yeah, hi! I'm umm, Phoebe Buffay, and I have babies coming out of
me."
4,Phoebe," Not yet. Umm, I heard they really hurt, do they hurt?"
6,Phoebe, Oh my God!
7,Ross, It's all right.
9,Phoebe," Oh no, none of them are the father. The father is my brother."
11,Rachel, I am so gonna miss watching you freak people out like that!
12,Joey," Okay, uh Pheebs, quick. Look! This (His video camera) is for the babies to
look at someday, so is-is there anything you want to say? Y'know before it all starts?"
13,Phoebe," Oh, okay, umm, hi kids! Um, it's me, Aunt Phoebe. I can't wait to see
you. Please don't hurt me! "
15,Ross," Hey, what took you guys so long? Your cab left when ours did!"
17,Monica," Well, we-we had to go back because I forget my jacket."
18,Chandler, That's right.
20,Rachel, You-you're not wearing a jacket.
21,Monica, Oh man! I did it again!
22,Phoebe," (standing up) Okay, so umm, somebody has to call Frank and Alice. (As
she is talking Joey is sticking the camera under her skirt.) And then my mom wants to
know-(notices Joey)-Joey, what are you doing?!"
23,Joey, I gotta get the before shot!
27,Rachel," Hi, Pheebs? Okay, so just spoke to the nurse and the reason that your
doctor is late is because uh, she's not coming."
28,Phoebe, What?!
29,Ross, Apparently she fell in the shower and hit her head.
30,Phoebe," Oh my God, she's so stupid!"
31,Ross," Look, Pheebs-Pheebs, it's gonna be okay."
32,Phoebe," That's easy for you to say, I don't see three kids coming out your
vagina!"
33,Rachel," Honey, listen, y'know what? The nurse said the doctor is wonderful."
34,Ross," Yeah, he's head of the department."
35,Phoebe," All right—Ooh! Oh dead God, save me! "
36,Monica, What?
37,Phoebe, I'm having my first contraction!
38,Chandler, Oh no.
39,Phoebe," Ooh, it's not bad."
40,Chandler, Okay.
41,Joey," Oh! (In an announcer type voice) And so the miracle of life begins, and
aaiiyyyeeee! (He grabs his side and doubles over in pain.)"
42,Chandler, Hey! You okay?
43,Joey," Ooh, something hurts!"
44,Phoebe," Ooh, it's sympathy pains. Ohh, that's so sweet!"
45,Joey, Are they? I didn't know I cared that much.
47,Ross, Hello.
49,Chandler," Did he just say, he loves Fonzie?"
50,Monica, That's what it sounded like.
51,Chandler, All right…
55,Phoebe, No-no-no! We haven't started yet. Where's Alice?
57,Chandler," Yeah, that's when if you get the babies out by the end of the month,
they give you 2% financing."
60,Rachel," (entering) Monica? You gonna be very proud of me. I just got us dates
with two unbelievably cute nurses."
61,Joey, Oh my!
62,Rachel, They're male nurses.
63,Joey, Not in my head.
64,Rachel," Anyway, they want to take us out Saturday night! What do you say?"
65,Monica," Umm. (Looks at Chandler who is using the phone.) Umm. Umm. I don't think
so."
66,Rachel," What? What are you talking about?! You-you're the one who's been telling
me to get over Ross and move on. I'm moving on, and you're moving on with me. Come on,
give me one good reason why you don't wanna go."
67,Monica," Umm, why don't you give me something that would be a good reason
and-and then I'll tell you if it's true."
68,Rachel, What?
69,Monica, Harder than it sounds. Isn't it?
70,Rachel," Okay, you're coming with me, and I also told them that if we're still
here when they get off that we'll go down to the cafeteria and have some Jell-O
with them."
71,Joey, (in a sexy voice) Yep! There's always room for Jell-O…
72,Rachel," Joey, how do you make that dirty?"
73,Joey," Oh, it's easy. Yeah, I-I can do it with anything. Watch uh, (snaps his
fingers and in a sexy voice) Grandma's chicken salad…"
75,Joey," (entering) Ross! Get a shot of this. (He's carrying an issue of the USA
Today and hands Ross the camera.) Hey babies! These are the headlines on the day you
were born! Okay, now girl baby turn away and boy babies… (Throws the paper away to
reveal a copy of Playpen, which is the TV version of Playboy Magazine.) Check it
out, huh?! This is what naked women looked like the month you were born. All right, now
let's dive right into the good stuff. (Joey opens the magazine and Ross sticks the camera
in it.)"
76,Phoebe," Oh, okay, I'm having another one! This one doesn't hurt either—Ooh,
yes it does! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ooh! (Checks under the blanket.) Oh, I was kinda hoping that
was it."
77,Ross," Hey, where are Monica and Rachel anyway?"
78,Joey," Oh, a couple of nurses asked them out. Maybe they're with them."
79,Chandler, Really? Male nurses?
80,Joey," Yeah, I was bummed too."
81,Chandler, So they're going on dates? When?
82,Joey, I think Saturday—(groans in pain again).
84,Phoebe," Umm, sympathy pains. I thought it was really sweet at first, but now I
think he's just trying to steal my thunder."
86,Phoebe, Hey.
88,Chandler," This-this Fonzie person you keep referring too, is that uh, is that
another doctor?"
90,Chandler, All right.
93,Phoebe," It's very weird! I don't want some guy down there telling me, I'm
y'know, dilatedamundo!"
94,Ross," To be fair, he doesn’t seem to be impersonating Fonzie…"
95,Phoebe," (interrupting) What are you doing?!! Why are you defending him?! Just
get me another doctor! One who is not crazy and who is not Fonzie!"
96,Ross," Again, it's not that he…"
99,Chandler, (spotting her) Oh-hey-hey-hey! There you are!
100,Monica," Umm, listen there's something I think you should know."
101,Chandler," Oh, is this about you-you dating the nurse? Yeah, Joey already told
me, and I am so-so fine. I mean, you and I we're just, y'know, we're nothing, we're
goofin' around."
102,Monica," Umm, actually I was about to tell you that I was, I was going to get out
of it, but hey, if we're just goofing around then uh, maybe I will go out with him."
103,Chandler, Fine! Maybe I will too!
104,Joey," (entering from the elevator caring gifts for the kids) Hey, you guys! Look
what I found in the giiiiiiift shop. (He doubles over in pain in front an old man in a
wheel chair.) Get up! Get up! Get up! (The old man waves him away.)"
106,Ross," Okay, Phoebe, this Dr. Oberman. He has no strong feelings about Fonzie or
any of the Happy Days gang."
107,Phoebe, Hi! And you're going into what grade?
109,Phoebe," (interrupting) Uh-huh, me too. Ross, maybe I should've specified that
I'd be needing a grown up doctor. "
111,Phoebe," Shh! Doogie, shh! Doesn't anybody understand that I'm gonna be having
babies soon? Huh? Go! Go little boy, go!"
116,Joey," Umm, well, what else could it be?"
118,Joey, Or?
122,Phoebe, They are. Why?
124,Phoebe, Happy birthday!
126,Rachel," Honey, y'know I just gotta tell you, I think this is such a terrific
thing you're having these babies for Frank and Alice."
127,Phoebe," I know, it is."
128,Rachel, Yeah!
129,Phoebe, Can I tell you a little secret?
130,Rachel, Yeah!
131,Phoebe, I want to keep one. (Giggles in excitement.)
132,Rachel," Ohh, I'm gonna be on the news!"
135,Rachel," Okay, Phoebe, honey, you gotta be kidding. I mean, you know you
cannot keep one of these babies!"
136,Phoebe," Why not?! Maybe I can, you don't know!"
137,Rachel," Yes! Yes! Yes, I do! I do know! Frank and Alice are gonna want to keep all
of their children!"
138,Phoebe," Maybe not! Y'know? Seriously, three babies are a handful maybe they're
y'know, looking for a chance to unload one of them. Listen, I-I hate to miss an
opportunity just because I didn't ask! Y'know?"
139,Rachel," Phoebe, no! This is, this is insane."
140,Phoebe," Oh, just ask him!"
141,Rachel, Me?!
142,Phoebe," I can't ask him! Do you have any idea how inappropriate that
would be?! All I'm saying is just talk to Frank. Okay? Just, y'know, feel him out!"
143,Rachel," No! Forget it! I am not gonna ask Frank to give you one of his
kids!!"
144,Phoebe, You're right. 
146,Phoebe, Tell him it's for you.
148,Monica, Feeling a little better sweetie?
149,Joey," Well, maybe a little. I wish you hadn't seen me throw up."
150,Monica, Me too.
151,Ross, (entering) Hey! I just heard. What's up?
153,Joey," (interrupting) Whoa-whoa! No-no-no-no-no, nothing is going up! Okay? Up,
up is not an option—what's a urethra? (Monica whispers what it is in his ear.) Are
you crazy?!"
155,Phoebe, (To Rachel) So did you ask him?
156,Rachel," No, I haven't had a chance to be alone with him yet."
157,Phoebe," Well, I'm kinda on a clock here."
159,Rachel, Y'know who I always liked? Mork.
161,Phoebe, Undo it. Undo it. Undo it.
163,Rachel," Yeah, but umm… Yes, but, Fonzie was already cool, so he wasn't
hurt, right?"
165,Monica, (entering with Chandler) Hey!
166,Phoebe, Hi!
167,Monica, (To Phoebe) How are you doing?
168,Phoebe," Okay, doctor says any minute now."
170,Phoebe," Sorry Frank, I'm kinda in the middle of the last favor you asked me to
do."
173,Rachel, Hi!
175,Rachel," Monica, this is Dan (points to him), one of the guys that we're gonna be
going out with on Saturday. (Mouths ""He's yours."" to her.) Uh Dan, Monica."
177,Monica," Hello Dan! I'm really looking forward to Saturday night! Really,
really!"
178,Chandler," So Dan, nurse not a doctor huh? Kinda girlie isn't it?"
179,Monica, Chandler!
181,Chandler, Oh.
183,Chandler," Sure. (Pause) And listen, thanks for doing that for us, by the way.
(Retreats in defeat.)"
184,Monica," So, why wait 'til Saturday, are you free tomorrow?"
186,Monica," Oh, great!"
187,Chandler," (to another female nurse) Hey, how 'bout it? You, me, Saturday night?"
189,Chandler, All right. Very good.
190,Phoebe," Oo, this is a big one. Eww! Arghhhh!!"
192,Joey," Ohh, get these things out of me!"
193,Ross, Breathe! Breathe! Breathe throw the pain.
195,Joey," I want the drugs Ross, I want the drugs! (He starts rocking back and
forth, taking Ross with him.)"
196,Ross, I do too! I do too!
197,Joey, Argh!
198,Ross, Argh!
199,Joey, Argh!
200,Ross, Argh!
203,Rachel, Hi!
205,Rachel," Oh, honey, don’t worry. She's gonna make it on time."
207,Rachel," Yeah. So Frank, three babies. Whew, that just seems like a lot, huh?"
209,Rachel," Yeah, fair enough."
213,Monica, Bye Dan!
215,Chandler," Bye, momi-moo."
218,Phoebe, What is that?
220,Phoebe, Oh my God!
233,Chandler, Yes!
235,Rachel," Oh, how does he look? How does he look?"
239,Phoebe, I already had a baby. Leave me alone.
251,Chandler," Oh God, kindergarten flashback."
253,Chandler," Okay, keep saying it!"
261,Joey, Oh my God.
262,Ross," You did it, man."
264,Joey," They're so small! (Both he and Ross look at them with satisfied looks on
their faces.)"
267,Monica, Great!
269,Chandler," So, are you really gonna go out with that nurse man?"
270,Monica," Well uh, you and I are just goofing around, I thought, why not goof
around with him."
271,Chandler," Y'know, I don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing around
in the dictionary… Well, I have, and the technical definition is, two friends who
care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together.
But if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to,
y'know, get you my original dictionary. I am so bad at this."
272,Monica, I think you're better than you think you are.
273,Chandler," Really? Okay, so…"
274,Monica, (interrupting) Know when to stop.
275,Chandler," Y'know, I sensed that I should stop. So we're okay?"
276,Monica," Yeah. All right, I'm gonna go tell Dan that it's not gonna happen. (They
kiss and as she starts to leave, Chandler starts to dance. Without turning around.) Don't
do the dance."
277,Chandler, Right!
279,Monica, I think you're my favorite.
280,Phoebe, Which one do you have?
281,Monica, I don't care.
282,Rachel," (entering) Hi. (To Phoebe) Hey, hi! So uh, Frank and Alice wanted me to
tell you that they're still outside making phone calls."
283,Phoebe," But umm, I mean, did you talk to them about, y'know…"
284,Rachel," Yeah, umm, no honey."
285,Phoebe," Oh. It was a long shot. Hey, you guys can I just like have a second
alone with the babies."
288,Phoebe," So, here you are. It seems like yesterday I was talking to you in that
little petri dish. Everyone said labor was the hardest thing I'd ever have to do, but they
were wrong this is. Oh, I had the most fun with you guys! I wish I could take you home and
see you everyday. Okay, I'll settle for being your favorite Aunt. I know Alice's sister
has a pool, but you lived in me. Okay, so we're cool. Yeah, we're gonna be great. Little
high fives! (Imitates the high fives.) Ahh! Ahh! Ahh! (One of the babies begins to cry.)
Well, if you're gonna cry. (She starts crying.)"
291,Monica," Phoebe, we are so proud of you! You're amazing!"
292,Phoebe, I know.
293,Rachel, So does it really hurt as bad as they say?
294,Phoebe, Yeah. You won't be able to take it.
295,Chandler," So uh, now that little Chandler turned out to be a girl, what are they
gonna name her?"
296,Phoebe, They're gonna call her Chandler.
297,Chandler," That's kind of a masculine name, don't you think?"
298,Phoebe, Works on you.
0,Monica, (In a sexy voice) Come in. I've been waiting for you. 
2,Rachel," Hi! I just wanna-(sees Monica)-Ahhh!!! Oh my God! (She runs out in
horror.) Oh my God!"
3,Monica," (pulling on a robe) Okay, I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I-I-I was um, I was
taking a nap."
4,Rachel," Since when do take naps in that position. Oh God Monica, tell me
you were waiting for a guy! Please tell me you were waiting for a guy!"
5,Monica," Yes. Yes, I was. A guy. From work. (Thinks) I'm seeing a guy from work!
Ha!"
6,Rachel," (Gasps) That cute waiter guy from your restaurant, the one that looks
like a non-threatening Ray Liotta?"
7,Monica," Uh-huh, that one!"
8,Rachel," Y'know what, just give me a second and I'll be out of your hair. I'm
just gonna grab a jacket. When I get back, I want every little detail. (There's a knock on
the door.) Maybe that's him. (Goes to answer the door.)"
9,Monica," (Panicking) Okay, umm, okay, umm… (Rachel opens the door.) It's
just Joey and Ross."
10,Rachel, Why aren't you guys at the movie?
11,Joey," Well, we were! But Ross was talking so loud on his phone they threw us
out!"
12,Ross, I had to talk loud because the movie was loud!
13,Joey, (to Monica and Rachel) He's talking to London!
14,Monica, But why?! Did he get in touch with Emily?
15,Joey," Well no, not yet. He's calling everyone on her side of the family hoping
that someone will help him get in touch with her."
16,Ross," (on phone) I-I-I don't care if I said some other girl's name you prissy,
old twit!"
17,Joey, Ross! Way to suck up to the family.
18,Chandler," (entering, happily, with a bottle of champagne, thinking that Monica
is the only one there) Ha-ha-ha-(sees everyone)-enh-enh. I'm so glad you guys are all
here! My office finally got wrinkle free fax paper!"
21,Joey," (entering, wearing a tux) Hey!"
22,Chandler," Oh no-no-no-no-no-no, vomit tux! No-no, vomit tux!"
23,Joey," Don't worry, I had it dry-cleaned."
24,Monica," Vomit tux? Who vomited on—y'know what, what you up to Joe?"
25,Joey," Well, I'm doing this telethon thing on TV and my agent got me a job as
co-host!"
26,Monica, Oh that's great!
27,Joey," A little uh, good deed for PBS and a little TV exposure, now that's the
kind of math Joey likes to do!"
28,Phoebe," Ugh, PBS!"
29,Monica, What's wrong with PBS?
30,Phoebe," Ugh, what's right with them?"
31,Joey," Why don’t you like PBS, Pheebs?"
32,Phoebe," Okay, 'cause right after my mom killed herself, I was just in this
really bad place, y'know personally. So, I just thought that it'd make me feel better if I
wrote to Sesame Street, 'cause they were so nice when I was a little kid! No one
ever wrote back."
33,Chandler, Well y'know a lot of those Muppets don't have thumbs.
34,Phoebe," All I got was a lousy key chain! And by that time I was living in a box.
I didn't have keys!"
35,Joey," I'm sorry Pheebs, I just, y'know, I just wanted to do a good deed.
Like-like you did with the babies."
36,Phoebe," This isn't a good deed, you just wanted to get on TV! This is totally
selfish."
37,Joey," Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What about you, having those babies for your brother?
Talk about selfish!"
38,Phoebe, What-what are you talking about?!
39,Joey," Well, yeah, it was a really nice thing and all, but it made you feel
really good right?"
40,Phoebe, Yeah. So?
41,Joey," It made you feel good, so that makes it selfish. Look, there's no
unselfish good deeds, sorry."
42,Phoebe, Yes there are! There are totally good deeds that are selfless.
43,Joey," Well, may I ask for one example?"
44,Phoebe," Yeah, it's… Y'know there's—no you may not!"
46,Joey, That's because all people are selfish.
47,Phoebe, Are you calling me selfish?!
48,Joey," Are you calling you people? (Chandler rolls his eyes.) Yeah, well sorry to
burst that bubble, Pheebs, but selfless good deeds don't exist. Okay? And you the deal on
Santa Clause right?"
49,Phoebe," I'm gonna find a selfless good dead. I'm gonna beat you, you evil
genius."
51,Ross, (on phone) Hello.
53,Ross," Emily? Emily! Oh my God! Oh my God, it's Emily! (He picks up a lamp and
hands it to Chandler, for no reason.) It's Emily everyone! Shush-shush-shhst! (to Emily)
Hi!"
55,Ross," No wait! Look, wait! Okay, you can hang up, but I'm gonna keep calling!
I'm gonna, I'm gonna call everyone in England if that's what it takes to get you to talk
to me!"
57,Ross," Look you're my wife. We're-we're married. Y'know? I-I love you. I-I really
miss you."
59,Ross," (to the gang, whispering) She's talking."
61,Phoebe," Hey, Joey, when you said the deal with Santa Clause, you meant?"
62,Joey, That he doesn't exist.
63,Phoebe, Right. (She turns and opens her eyes in shock.)
65,Rachel," So Chandler, have you heard about Monica's secret boyfriend?"
66,Chandler," Uhh, yeah. She uh, she uh, she uh might've mentioned him."
67,Rachel," So Mon, when are we gonna meet this new secret waiter man?"
68,Monica," Ohh, he's really shy. I-I don’t think he's up to meeting everyone
yet."
69,Chandler," Yeah, I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet."
70,Rachel," I don’t care! I wanna meet this guy who's the best sex she ever
had!"
72,Chandler, Really?! That's what you heard? (To Monica) You said that?
73,Monica, I might've said that. (Chandler laughs.) Why is that funny?
74,Chandler," Because I'm very happy for him! (To Monica) And you, you lucky
dog!"
75,Ross, (entering) Hi!
76,Monica, Hey!
77,Ross," Well, Emily's willing to work on the relationship."
78,Chandler, Yes!
79,Monica, That's great!
80,Ross, In London!
81,Monica, What?!
82,Ross, She wants me to move to London.
83,Monica, But you live here! (Ross rolls his eyes.) You know that.
84,Rachel, What-what-what are you gonna do?
85,Ross," I bet if I talk to Carol and Susan I can convince them to move to London
with Ben."
86,Monica," Yeah, I'm sure your ex-wife will be more than happy to move to another
country so you can patch things up with your new wife."
87,Ross, It could happen.
89,Joey, (To the pledge volunteers) How ya doin'? Welcome. Good to see ya!
91,Joey," That's great. But uh, I'm not really expecting a lot of calls."
93,Joey, But I'm the host!
95,Joey," You don't seem to understand. See, I was Dr. Drake Remoray."
98,Phoebe," I cannot believe I can't find a selfless good deed! Y'know that old guy
that lives next to me? Well, I snuck over there and-and raked up all the leaves on his
front stoop. But he caught me and force-fed me cider and cookies. Then I felt wonderful.
That old jackass!"
99,Rachel, Maybe Joey's right. Maybe all good deeds are selfish.
100,Phoebe," I will find a selfless good deed! 'Cause I just gave birth to three
children and I will not let them be raised in a world where Joey is right!"
101,Chandler," (entering) Hey, Monica? Can I ask you a cooking question?"
102,Monica, Sure!
103,Chandler," If you're cooking on the stove, does that mean that your new secret
boyfriend is better in bed than Richard?"
104,Rachel, Chandler! (Pause) Is he?
105,Monica," Well, y'know I-I-I think I'm gonna respect the privacy of my new secret
boyfriend."
106,Chandler," Why?! I mean if this guy was me and it was me who had
learned that it was me who was the best you'd ever had, I'd be going like this. (He
jumps up onto the table and starts doing his happy dance.)"
108,Ross," All right Emily, as much as I love you, I'm sorry, I can't move to London
without Ben."
110,Ross," Yeah, would you please consider moving here? I mean you were gonna
move here anyway, why can't you just do that?"
112,Ross," Oh-oh-okay, but-but I know, that even though I've been a-a complete
idiot up 'til now, I mean, I mean you-you-you have to come here. You have to come here so
we can work this out."
114,Ross," All right, did you just say all right?"
116,Ross," Oh, Emily that is, that is so great. It's gonna be so great! We're gonna
be like-like-like two idiots in love!"
119,Ross," Yes, tell me."
121,Ross," I know. I am, I am so sorry."
123,Ross," Again, very sorry."
125,Ross," Emily, there is nothing between Rachel and me. Okay? I love you."
127,Ross, Oh that is so great! That's…
131,Ross," So I asked Emily if she would come to New York, and she said yes."
132,Chandler, Yes!
133,Phoebe, Ooh-ohh!
134,Monica, Great!
135,Ross, No-no-no! Only if I promise never to see Rachel again.
136,Phoebe, Why?
137,Monica, What?! You can't—what did you tell her?
138,Ross," I told her I'd have to think about it. I mean, how the hell am I supposed
to make this kind of a decision? (They're all quiet.) I'm actually asking you!"
139,Chandler," Well, you can't just not see Rachel anymore, she's one of your best
friends."
140,Monica," Yeah! But, he can't not exactly see Emily, I mean that's his wife."
141,Phoebe, Yeah.
142,Chandler, That's true!
143,Phoebe," Yeah, but you've known Rachel since High School and you cannot just cut
her out of your life."
144,Chandler, That's true!
145,Monica," No, you cannot."
146,Ross," Thanks for the help, problem solved. (Wipes his hands.)"
148,Monica, (answering it) Hello.
149,Joey, (on phone) Hey Mon!
150,Monica," Oh hey Joey! We've been watching all day, when are you gonna be on TV?"
151,Joey," See, there was kind of a mix up in my agent's office, but I'm still on TV
and that's good exposure. "
152,Monica, (Looking at the TV) You're not on TV.
153,Joey," Oh, uh, okay, how, how about now? (He waves his hand in front of the woman
next to him and you can now see his arm on TV.)"
154,Chandler," Hey, there he is! There he is!"
155,Joey, Hello New York! (The woman bats his hand out of the way.)
159,Chandler," How many times have I told you guys, you never watch the
cooking channel!"
160,Monica, (entering) Hi Chandler.
161,Chandler, Hey!
162,Monica," Uh, listen, I need that broiling pan that Joey borrowed the other day."
163,Chandler," Oh that was yours? Uh, yeah, we used it when the duck was throwing up
caterpillars. "
164,Monica," William Sonoma, fall catalog, Page 27."
165,Chandler," Expect it in 4-6 weeks. (She starts to leave.) Umm, hey, umm, Joey's
gonna be at the telethon for the rest of the day, we have the whole place to ourselves."
166,Monica," Yeah, so?"
167,Chandler," Well I just, thought maybe you'd wanna book some time with the best
you'd ever had."
168,Monica," Y'know what, champ? I think I'll pass."
169,Chandler, Why?
170,Monica," Why? (She hops into the living room and imitates Chandler's happy
dance.)"
171,Chandler, What's your point?
173,Joey, (in a bored voice) PBS telethon.
174,Phoebe," (on phone from Central Perk) Hey Joey, I just wanted to let you know
that I found a selfless good deed. I just went down to the park and I let a bee sting me."
175,Joey, What?! What good is that gonna do anybody?
176,Phoebe," Well, it helps the bee look tough in front of his bee friends. The bee
is happy and I am definitely not."
177,Joey," Now, y'know the bee probably died after he stung ya."
178,Phoebe," (Thinks for a moment.) Aw, dammit! (Slams the phone down.)"
181,Joey," Hey, excuse me, would you mind switching with me?"
183,Joey, Come on man! You've been here all day!
188,Ross," (entering) Okay, that's it. I cannot make this decision! It is too
difficult, so I'm just gonna leave it entirely to the gods of fate. (He holds up and
starts shaking a…)"
189,Monica," A Magic Eight ball?! You can't be serious, you can't make this decision
with a toy!"
190,Phoebe," Ooh, it's not a toy."
191,Ross," Well, I don't know what else to do. I mean, I either keep my wife and lose
one of my-my-my best friends or I keep my friend and get divorced the second time before
I'm 30! So-so if anyone has-has a better suggestion, let's hear it! 'Cause I-I got
nothing! All right, don't be shy, any suggestion will do. (There are none.) Okay then.
Here we go. Magic 8 Ball, should I never see Rachel again? (He turns it over and reads the
answer) Ask again later. Later is not good enough. (He shakes it up again and reads the
answer.) Ask again later. What the hell! This is broken! It-it is broken!"
192,Monica," All right, let me see. (She grabs the 8 ball.) Will Chandler have sex
tonight? (Reads the answer.) Don't count on it. Seems like it works to me."
194,Joey, (in an unenthusiastic voice) PBS Telethon.
195,Phoebe, (on phone) Hi Joey.
196,Joey, Hey Pheebs!
197,Phoebe, I would like to make a pledge. I would like to donate $200.
198,Joey," $200? Are you sure Pheebs? I mean, after what Sesame Street did to
ya?"
199,Phoebe," Oh, I'm still mad at them but I also now that they bring happiness to
lots of kids who's moms didn't kill themselves, so by supporting them, I'm doing a good
thing, but I'm not happy about it. So there, a selfless good deed."
200,Joey, And you don't a little good about donating the money?
201,Phoebe," No, it sucks. I was saving up to buy a hamster."
202,Joey," A hamster? What, those things are like 10 bucks."
203,Phoebe," Yeah, not the one I had my eye on."
205,Phoebe," Oh, look-look, Joey's on TV! Isn't that great? My pledge got Joey on TV!
Oh that makes me feel—Oh no! (Realizes that her deed made her happy and therefore
it's selfish and covers her mouth in horror.)"
207,Chandler," (entering) Look, maybe I got carried away before. But there's
something you gotta know. If I'm the best, it's only because you've made me the best."
208,Monica, Keep talking.
209,Chandler," I mean I was nothing before you. Call the other girls and ask. Which
wouldn't take long. But when I'm with you, and we're together, OH…MY…GOD."
210,Monica, Really?
211,Chandler," Oh-aw my God! Now, I understand if you never want to sleep with me
again, but that would be wrong. We're too good! We owe it, to sex!"
212,Monica," Well, if we owe it? (She throws down her cleaning stuff and jumps into
his arms.) Oh my… When is Joey gonna be home?"
213,Chandler," Well, I was kinda hoping we could do this without him. (She starts to
take off her latex gloves.) Oh no-no-no, leave the gloves on."
214,Monica," But, I just cleaned the bathroom."
215,Chandler," Yeah, why don't we lose the gloves."
216,Monica, Yeah. (She takes them off.)
218,Chandler," All right, let's show them how it's done."
219,Monica, Okay.
221,Monica, Ow!
222,Chandler, Y'know that wasn't part of it?
223,Monica, I know!
226,Rachel, (entering) Hi! Are you ready? We're gonna be late!
227,Ross, For what?
228,Rachel, For Stella! Remember? She's gettin' her grove back in like 20 minutes.
229,Ross," Yeah, I uh, totally forgot about that. You mind if I take a rain check?
I'm waiting for a call from Emily."
230,Rachel," Sure. I guess. Hey, I hear you don't have to go to London. Yay!"
231,Ross," It's not that easy, there's still a lot of relationship stuff."
232,Rachel, Like what?
233,Ross, Just stuff. Y'know kinda what Emily wants.
234,Rachel," Well, why don't you talk to me about it, maybe I can help."
235,Ross," No. No. You-you can't help. I mean, I kinda have to do this without your
help."
236,Rachel," Well, I-I know you can do that too. I'm just, I'm just saying if you
need somebody to talk to… Hi!"
237,Ross, Thanks.
238,Rachel," Ross? Look, whatever this relationship stuff that Emily wants, just give
it to her. Come on, the bottom line here is that you love her. So just fix whatever she
wants fixed. Just do it. (The phone starts ringing.) I mean, you're gonna have to
try. You'll just gonna hate yourself if you don't. (The phone keeps ringing.) Oh come on
answer it! It's driving me crazy!"
239,Ross," (answering the phone.) Hello. (Listens) Hi sweetie. (Listens.) Good. Look
umm, yes I've been thinking about that thing that you wanted me to do and, I can do it.
(Rachel gives him a thumbs up.) So will you come to New York? (Rachel wants to know what
she said, and he gives her a thumbs up and she goes over and hugs him. All the time not
knowing what's going on.)"
242,Monica, Never done that before.
243,Chandler, Nope.
0,Monica, (quietly) Hi!
1,Chandler, (quietly) Hi! (They both start kissing.)
3,Joey, Monica? What time is it?
4,Chandler," Uhh, 9. (He pushes the clock into the sink.)"
5,Joey, But it's dark out.
6,Monica," Well that's because you always sleep to noon, silly! This is what 9
looks like."
7,Joey," I guess I'll get washed up then. Watch that sunrise. (He goes into the
bathroom.)"
8,Monica, I'm really getting tired of sneaking around.
9,Chandler," I know, me too. Hey! Y'know what if we went away for a whole weekend?
Y'know we'd have no interruptions and we could be naked the entire time."
10,Monica, All weekend? That's a whole lotta naked.
11,Chandler," Yeah, I can say that I have a conference and you can say you have a
chef thing."
12,Monica," Ohh, I've always wanted to go to this culinary fair that they have in
Jersey!"
13,Chandler," Okay, y'know your not though. Let's go. (He starts for his bedroom.)"
14,Monica, Wait! What about Joey?
18,Monica," (entering from her room) Hey, guess what I'm doing this weekend! I'm
going to this culinary fair in New Jersey."
19,Phoebe," Oh weird, Chandler just told us he's got a conference there!"
20,Monica," Oh now that-that-that's funny, it seems like Chandler's conference
could've been in Connecticut or Vermont."
21,Chandler," I'm not in charge of where the conference is held. Do you want people
to think it's a fake conference? It's a real conference."
22,Ross, (entering) Hey.
23,Joey, Hey!
24,Monica, Hey.
25,Ross, Is Rachel here? I gotta talk to her.
26,Monica," No, she's out shopping."
27,Ross, Damn!
28,Chandler, What's going on?
29,Ross," I told Emily to come. And I just need to y'know, talk to Rachel about it."
30,Phoebe," Wait a minute! So when Emily comes you're just, you're not gonna see
Rachel anymore?"
31,Ross," Well look, I'm just trying to focus on the ""I get to see my
wife,"" part, all right? And not the part that makes me do this. (He takes a big swig
of Pepto Bismol.)"
32,Monica," Wow, so you guys are, you're never gonna be in the same room together?
How is that even gonna work?"
33,Ross, I have no idea. I mean… But-but I assure you I will figure it out.
35,Joey," Doesn’t seem like it's going to work, I mean…"
36,Rachel," (entering) Hi, guys!"
37,Joey, Hi!
38,Chandler," Uh, hey!"
39,Rachel, What's going on?
40,Chandler, We're flipping Monica's mattress.
41,Joey," So I'm thinking, basically we pick it up and then we flip it."
42,Phoebe, Yeah that's better than my way.
44,Rachel," Oh okay, hey guys, would you flip mine too?"
45,Chandler," Aww, man! (They go into Monica's room.)"
46,Rachel, (going through the mail) Oh look! A letter from my mom.
47,Ross," So, Rach, y'know-y'know how Emily's coming right?"
48,Rachel, Oh yeah! I know.
50,Phoebe, (To Chandler) Can you hear anything?
51,Chandler," Oh yes, somebody just said, ""Can you hear anything?"""
53,Monica," Hey, Joey's ass! What are you doing?"
54,Joey," (holding a box) Well, remember when they got in that big fight and broke
up and we were all stuck in her with no food or anything? Well, when Ross said Rachel at
the wedding, I figured it was gonna happen again, so I hid this in here."
55,Monica," Ooh, candy bars, crossword puzzles…"
56,Phoebe," Ooh, Madlibs, mine! (Grabs it.)"
57,Chandler, Condoms?
58,Joey," You don't know how long we're gonna be in here! We may have to
repopulate the Earth."
59,Chandler, And condoms are the way to do that?
61,Ross," Anyway it-it kinda-it all boils down to this, the last time I talked to
Emily…"
62,Rachel, (interrupting) Oh my God! My dog died!
63,Ross, What?!
64,Rachel," Oh my God, Le Poo, our dog!"
65,Ross, Le Poo's still alive?!
66,Rachel," Oh God, it says he was hit by an ice cream truck and dragged for
nine-(turns over the note)-teen blocks. Oh. (They all come out from Monica's bedroom) Oh
my God."
67,Monica," Sweetie, we heard you crying. Please don't cry."
68,Rachel, It's Le Poo.
69,Phoebe," I know it's le poo right now, but it'll get better."
71,Chandler, (jumping on the bed) I can't believe it! We're here!
72,Monica," Ooh, chocolates on the pillows! I love that!"
73,Chandler," Oh, you should live with Joey, Roll-os everywhere."
74,Monica," Come here. (He does, and they kiss.) Okay, be right back. "
76,Chandler," Oh yes! Monica, get in here! There's a high-speed car chase on!"
78,Monica, We're switching rooms.
79,Chandler," (looks at what she's holding and shies away) Oh dear God, they gave us
glasses!"
80,Monica," No, they gave us glasses with lipstick on them! I mean, if they didn't
change the glasses, who knows what else they didn't change. (He glares at her.) Come on
sweetie, I just want this weekend to be perfect, I mean we can change rooms, can't we?"
81,Chandler," Okay, but let's do it now though, because Chopper 5 just lost it's
feed! (He grabs their bags and sprints out.)"
83,Ross," Hey, so uh, y'know how there's something I wanted to talk to you about?"
84,Rachel, Oh yeah! (Turns to face him.)
85,Ross," Well, y'know how I'm trying to work things out with Emily. Well, there's
this one thing… Okay, (Rachel has her back turned to the camera, and Ross isn't
looking at her.) here goes. I made a promise that-(they cut to the other camera and Ross
notices something coming out of Rachel's nose)-Oh hey!"
86,Rachel, What?
87,Ross, You're nose is bleeding!
88,Rachel," Oh God. (He hands her some tissues.) No! Oh not again! (Wiping her
nose.) This-this happened when my grandfather died. It's ugh! Sorry. (She puts her head
back.) Oh, okay, so I'm sorry, what-what were you-what did you want to tell me?"
89,Ross, Umm… (Rachel blows her nose.)
90,Rachel, Sorry. Sorry.
91,Ross," Okay, I uh, I can't see you anymore."
92,Rachel," Yeah, I know. It's ridiculous! I can't see you either."
95,Chandler," Okay, great. (He grabs the remote and turns on the TV to the chase.)"
97,Chandler, Half a tank? We still got a lot of high-speed chasing to do!
98,Monica, We're switching rooms again.
99,Chandler, What? Why?
100,Monica," This is a garden view room, and we paid for an ocean view room."
102,Monica," (To Chandler) Excuse me, umm, can I talk to you over here for just a
second?"
103,Chandler, Uh-huh. (He doesn't take his eyes off the TV.)
104,Monica, Chandler!
105,Chandler, (turning to face her) Yeah.
106,Monica," Look, these clowns are trying to take us for a ride and I'm not gonna
let 'em! And we're not a couple of suckers!"
107,Chandler," I hear ya, Mugsy! But look, all these rooms are fine okay? Can you
just pick one so I can watch-(realizes)-have a perfect, magical weekend together with you."
109,Monica," Okay, this one I like!"
110,Chandler," (watching TV, in fact, ER is on.) Nothing! It's over! Dammit! This is
regularly scheduled programming!"
111,Monica," Can we turn the TV off? Okay? Do we really want to spend the entire
weekend like this?"
112,Chandler," Oh, I'm sorry, am I getting in the way of all the room switching fun?"
113,Monica," Hey, don't blame me for wigging tonight!"
114,Chandler," Oh, who should I blame? The nice bell man who had to drag out luggage
to 10 different rooms?"
115,Monica," I don't know, how about the idiot who thought he could drive from Albany
to Canada on a half a tank of gas!"
116,Chandler, Do not speak ill of the dead.
117,Monica," We're supposed to uh, be spending a romantic weekend together, it-it,
what is the matter with you?"
118,Chandler," I just want to watch a little television. What is the big deal? Geez,
relax mom."
119,Monica, What did you say?
120,Chandler," I said, ""Geez, relax Monnnnn."""
122,Rachel, Hi!
123,Ross," Hey. Rachel, I-I-I've been wanting to tell you something for a while now
and I really, I just have to get it out."
124,Rachel," Okay, what's up?"
125,Ross," Okay, y'know how you told me I should do whatever it takes to fix my
marriage?"
126,Rachel," Yeah, I told you to give Emily whatever she wants."
127,Ross," And while that was good advice, you should know that what-what she
wants… "
128,Rachel, Yeah?
129,Ross, …is for me not to see you anymore.
130,Rachel," That's crazy! You can't do that! What are you going to tell her? (Pause)
(Realizes) Oh God. Ohh, you already agreed to this, haven't you?"
131,Ross," It's awful I know, I mean, I feel terrible but I have to do this if I want
my marriage to work. And I do, I have to make this marriage work. I have too. But
the good thing is we can still see each other until she gets here."
132,Rachel," Ohh! Lucky me! Oh my God! That is good news, Ross! I think that's
the best news I've heard since Le Poo died!"
133,Ross, You have no idea what a nightmare this has been. This is so hard.
134,Rachel," Oh yeah, really? Is it Ross? Yeah? Okay, well let me make this a just a
little bit easier for you."
135,Ross, What are you doing?
136,Rachel, Storming out!
137,Ross," Rachel, this is your apartment."
138,Rachel," Yeah, well that's how mad I am!!"
141,Chandler, Damn Rollos!
142,Joey," Hey, you're back!"
143,Chandler, Hey.
144,Joey, How was your conference?
145,Chandler," It was terrible. I fought with (Pause) my colleagues y'know, the
entire time. Are you kidding with this? (Throws away another Rollo)"
146,Joey," Oh, so your weekend was a total bust?"
147,Chandler," Uh, no, I got to see Donald Trump waiting for an elevator."
148,Monica, (entering) Hi!
149,Joey," Hey, you're back too!"
150,Monica," Yeah. Umm, Chandler can I talk to you outside for a second?"
151,Joey," Hey, how was your chef thing?"
152,Monica," Oh, it was awful. (To Chandler) I guess some people just don't
appreciate really good food."
153,Chandler," Well, maybe it was the kind of food that tasted good at first but then
made everybody vomit and have diarrhea."
154,Monica, Chandler! (Motions for him to come outside.)
155,Chandler, Monica. (Follows her out.)
157,Monica," Okay, I'd like to know how much the room was because I'd like to pay my
half."
158,Chandler," Okay, fine, $300."
159,Monica, 300 dollars?!
160,Chandler," Yeah, just think of it as $25 per room!"
161,Monica, Urghh!!
162,Joey, (sticking his head out the door) What are you guys woofing about?
163,Monica, Chandler stole a twenty from my purse!
164,Joey," Nooooo!!! Y'know what? Now that I think about it, I constantly find myself
without twenties and you always have lots!"
166,Ross," You should've seen the look on her face. I don't want Rachel to hate me! I
don't know what to do."
167,Joey, You want my advice?
168,Ross, Yes! Please!
169,Joey, You're not gonna like it.
170,Ross, That's okay.
171,Joey, You got married to fast.
172,Ross, That's not advice!
173,Joey, I told ya.
174,Ross, I'm going to the bathroom. (Gets up and exits.)
175,Joey," Man, if anyone asked me to give up any of you, I couldn't do it."
177,Monica, Maybe I could do it.
178,Rachel, (entering) Hi!
179,Joey," Hi, Rach."
180,Chandler, Hi!
181,Phoebe, Hey.
182,Monica, Hey.
183,Rachel," Look, I know you guys heard about the whole thing with me and Ross but
y'know, I've been obsessing about it all day and I'd just love not to talk about
it. All right?"
184,Joey," I-I-I don't know if this falls under this category, but uh, Ross is right
back there. (Points over his shoulder.)"
185,Rachel, That's not Ross!
186,Phoebe, Oh no! Not that guy! He does look like him though.
187,Chandler," Okay, Ross is in the bathroom."
188,Rachel," Oh my God, its happening. It's already started. I'm Kip."
189,Joey," Hey, you're not Kip!"
190,Rachel, (To Joey) Do you even know who Kip is?
191,Joey, Who cares? You're Rachel! (To Chandler) Who's Kip?
192,Chandler," Kip, my old roommate, y'know we all used to hang out together."
193,Joey," Oh, that poor bastard."
194,Rachel," See? Yeah, you told me the story. He and Monica dated when they broke up
they couldn't even be in the same room together and you all promised that you would stay
his friend and what happened? He got phased out!"
195,Monica, You're not gonna be phased out!
196,Rachel," Well, of course I am! It's not gonna happen to Ross! He's your brother.
(To Chandler) He's your old college roommate. Ugh, it was just a matter of time before
someone had to leave the group. I just always assumed Phoebe would be the one to go."
197,Phoebe, Ehh!!
198,Rachel," Honey, come on! You live far away! You're not related. You lift right
out."
200,Chandler, (entering) Hey!
201,Joey," Hey, Mr. Bing. That uh, hotel you stayed at called. Said someone left an
eyelash curler in your room."
202,Chandler, Yes that was mine.
203,Joey, 'Cause I figured you'd hooked up with some girl and she'd left it there.
204,Chandler, Yes that would have made more sense.
205,Joey," Y'know, I-I don't even feel like I know you anymore man! All right, look,
I'm just gonna ask you this one time. And whatever you say, I'll believe ya. (Pause.) Were
you, or were you not on a gay cruise?!"
207,Rachel," Phoebe? (She turns her head further away.) I'm sorry about the whole
lifting out thing. (Moves over next to her.) You gotta come with me!"
208,Phoebe, Come where?
209,Rachel," Wherever I go. Come on you and me, we'll-we'll start a new group, we're
the best ones."
210,Phoebe," Okay, but try and get Joey too."
211,Ross," (entering) Pheebs, you mind if I speak to Rachel alone for a sec?"
212,Phoebe," Oh, sure! (She gets up to leave.) Bye Ross! (Whispering behind his
back.) Forever."
213,Ross, Hi.
214,Rachel, Hi. What are you doing here? Isn't this against the rules?
215,Ross," I talked to Monica, look, I'm the one who made the choice. I'm the
one who's making things change, so I should be the one to y'know, step back."
216,Rachel," Oh, Ross…"
217,Ross," No, no, it's okay. Really. They're plenty of people who just see their
sisters at Thanksgiving and just see their college roommates at reunions and just see Joey
at Burger King. So is, is that better?"
218,Rachel," No, it's not better. I still don't get to see you."
219,Ross," Well, what-what would you do? Rach, if you were me, what-what would you
do?"
220,Rachel," Well, for starters I would've said the right name at my wedding!"
221,Ross, I can't believe this is happening.
222,Rachel, I know.
223,Ross, I am so sorry.
224,Rachel, I know that too.
225,Joey," (entering) (He clears his throat to get their attention.) Hey, Rach? Sorry
to interrupt but umm, Phoebe wanted me to talk to you about a trip or something."
227,Chandler, (entering) Hey!
228,Monica, Hi.
229,Chandler," I just came over to drop off…nothing. So that weekend kinda
sucked, huh?"
230,Monica," Yeah, it did."
231,Chandler," So, I guess this is over."
232,Monica, What?
233,Chandler," Well, y'know, you and me, it had to end sometime."
234,Monica," Why, exactly?"
235,Chandler," Because of the weekend, we had a fight."
236,Monica," Chandler that's crazy! If you give up every time you'd have a fight with
someone you'd never be with anyone longer than—Ohhh! (They both realize something
there.)"
237,Chandler," So, this isn't over?"
238,Monica," (laughs) You are so cute! No. No, it was a fight. You deal with it and
move on! It's nothing to freak out about."
239,Chandler, Really? Okay. Great!
240,Monica," Ohh, welcome to an adult relationship! (She goes to kiss him.)"
241,Chandler, (stops her) We're in a relationship?
242,Monica, I'm afraid so.
243,Chandler, Okay.
246,Phoebe, Hey!
247,Monica, Hey!
248,Phoebe," Oh hey, Monica, I heard you saw Donald Trump at your convention."
249,Monica," Yeah, I saw him waiting for an elevator."
251,Monica," Hey, Rach, can I borrow your eyelash curler, I think I lost mine."
252,Rachel," Yeah, it's in there. (Points to the bathroom.)"
254,Joey, (shocked) Oh! Ohh! Oh!!
255,Chandler," Joey, can I talk to you for a second? (He grabs him and starts to drag
Joey into Monica's room.)"
256,Joey, Oohh!! Ohh! Oh-oh-oh! Oh-oh!!
259,Joey, Ohhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!
260,Chandler, Yes. Yes. (Lets him up.)
261,Joey, (To Chandler) You?! (To Monica) And-and you?!
262,Monica," Yes, but you cannot tell anyone! No one knows!"
263,Joey, How?! When?!
264,Chandler, It happened in London.
265,Joey, IN LONDON!!!
266,Chandler," The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a
big deal out of it."
267,Joey, But it is a big deal!! I have to tell someone! 
269,Chandler, No-no-no-no-no! You can't!
270,Monica," Please? Please?! We just don't want to deal with telling everyone, okay?
Just promise you won't tell."
272,Joey," All right! Man, this is unbelievable! I mean, it's great, but…"
273,Monica," I know, it's great!"
275,Joey," Aww, I don't want to see that!"
277,Phoebe," We're so stupid! Do you know what's going on in there? They're trying to
take Joey!"
280,Phoebe," The most popular Phoebe in tennis is called the overhand Phoebe. And if
you win, you must slap your opponent on the Phoebe and say, ""Hi, Phoebe!"""
281,Monica," Oh that's cute! We really all enjoyed it. But y'know, it doesn't count."
282,Phoebe, Count for what?
283,Monica, Count in our heads as-as good Madlibs.
285,Joey, I guess I'm done.
286,Chandler, Fun's over!
287,Monica," Wait-wait, guys! If-if we follow the rules, it's still fun and it means
something!"
288,Rachel, Uh-huh!
289,Joey, I think I'm gonna take-off.
290,Monica," Guys, rules are good! Rules help control the fun! (They all leave and
close the door on Monica.) Ohhh! (Throws her notepad down in disgust.)"
0,Joey," (entering) Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!! None of that, not while you're living
under my roof!"
1,Monica, What?!
2,Joey," Look, just because I know about you two, doesn't mean I like
looking at it."
3,Chandler, Aren't you supposed to be at an audition for another hour?
4,Joey," Well, I'm sorry if I'm not a middle-aged black woman! (Starts for his
room.) And I'm also sorry if sometimes I go to the wrong audition! Okay, look, if I
have to pretend I don't know about you two, then you two are gonna have to pretend there's
nothing to know about."
6,Monica, Sorry.
7,Chandler, Sorry.
9,Joey, (from the bedroom) I can hear that!
10,Monica, (To Chandler) Rachel's at work.
13,Joey, I can still hear you!
16,Phoebe, Hey!
17,Joey, Hey!
18,Chandler, Hello!
19,Monica," Hey, what's that?"
20,Phoebe," Yeah, my mom sent me a family heirloom that once belonged to my
grandmother. Can you believe it?! A year ago I didn't even have a family, and now I have
heirlooms for crying out loud."
22,Phoebe," Eeeee-(She opens the box and removes its contents and sees that it's a
fur coat.)-ohh!! God! (She throws it at Joey.)"
23,Joey," Argh-argh!! (Catches the coat.) Ooh, soft. Is this mink?"
24,Phoebe," Yeah! Why would my mother send me a fur? Doesn't she know me but
at all! Plus, I have a perfectly fine coat that no innocent animal suffered to make!"
25,Chandler," Yeah, just some 9-year-old Filipino kids who worked their fingers
bloody for 12 cents an hour. (Phoebe stares at him wide-eyed. Chandler sees her reaction.)
That didn't happen, I made that up!"
26,Ross, (entering) Hey!
28,Ross, How come? Everybody else does.
30,Monica, What is that?
31,Ross," Oh, umm, I'm just getting rid of a couple of things."
32,Monica, (looking at the flyer) This is all of your things.
33,Ross," Yes, yes it is! No, but it's good it's—Emily thinks we should get all
new stuff. Stuff that's just ours, together. Y'know brand new."
34,Monica," So basically, this is a getting-rid-of-everything-Rachel-ever-used sale."
35,Ross, Touched. Used. Sat on. Sleep on.
37,Joey," Hey, Ross, you're okay with that?"
38,Ross," Look, if I can just do what Emily wants and get her to New York,
I'm sure everything will be fine."
39,Chandler," Okay, but don't you think this is a little extreme?"
40,Ross, After what I did? Can you blame her?
41,Phoebe," Oh my God! You got off easy! When my friend Silvie's husband said
someone else's name in bed, she cursed him and turned his thingy green."
43,Joey," (after Ross is gone) What is he doing? What, Emily, thinks Ross's
furniture has got Rachel coodies?"
44,Monica, Now calm down Joey.
45,Joey," No! Everything's gettin' all messed up, y'know? Emily won't let Ross see
Rachel, we're not gonna stop seeing Rachel, hence Ross stops seeing us!"
46,Phoebe," Oh, I hate this. Everything's changing."
47,Chandler," Yeah I know, we're losing Ross, Joey said hence…"
48,Monica," Look, I'm not happy about this either, but y'know if-if Ross says he's
happy then we're just gonna have to keep our feelings about Emily to ourselves. Are you
cool with that?"
49,Joey," No! But y'know, I'm an actor, I'll act cool."
51,Rachel," Ohh, whoa God! Storage rooms give me the creeps! Monica, come on please
hurry up honey! Please? "
52,Monica," Rachel, if you want the little round waffles, you gotta have to wait
until I find the little waffle iron."
53,Rachel, I want the little round waffles.
54,Monica," All right. (Looking through a box.) Op, here it is! Right underneath the
can of-of bug bomb. I wonder if the best place to put something that cooks food is
underneath the can of poison?"
56,Rachel," Okay, y'know what? I'll-I'll have toast!"
58,Rachel, Arghhhh!!!!!!
60,Monica, Oh my God! Fog him! Fog him!
63,Phoebe, I don't know what I'm gonna do about this coat.
64,Joey, I'll take it!
65,Phoebe, That might work! (She gives him the coat.)
66,Joey," Ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah! (He drapes it around his shoulders.) Enh? All right,
what do you think?"
67,Chandler, You're on in 5 Ms. Minnelli. 
68,Ross," (on the phone) No-no-no, it's just a bit sudden. (Listens) No, it's great.
Okay? I'm totally on board. I love you too, all righty. Bye. (Hangs up.)"
69,Joey, What's the matter Ross?
70,Ross," Nothing. Oh, actually, great news! I just got off the phone with Emily and
it looks like I'm moving to a new apartment. Woo-hoo!"
71,Phoebe, Why?
72,Ross," Well, her thought is, and I agree, fresh new furniture, why not a fresh
new apartment? Her cousin has this great place to sublet, it's got a view of the river on
one side and Columbia on the other."
73,Joey," That's way uptown! That's like three trains away! (Phoebe pinches him.)
Which is great! I love to ride that rail!"
74,Chandler, So you're really okay with this?
75,Ross," Yes! Yes! I mean it's-it's kinda far from work, but uh, y'know, I'll get
so much done on the commute. I-I've been given the gift of time!"
76,Chandler," Now that's so funny, because last Christmas I got the gift of space.
We should get them together and make a continuum."
78,Joey," Now he's movin'? Man, what is Emily doing to him? (Phoebe pinches him
again.) Ow!! He's not even here!!!"
80,Rachel, You guys! You guys!
81,Monica," We were, we were just in the storage area and we saw this really creepy
man!"
82,Rachel," It was like this crazy-eyed, hairy beast man! He was like a, like a
bigfoot or a yeti or something!"
83,Monica," And he came at us with an axe, so Rachel had to use a bug bomb on him!"
84,Rachel," (proud of herself) Yeah, I-I-I just pulled the tab and I just fogged his
yeti ass!"
85,Joey," Uhh, like dark hair, bushy beard?"
86,Rachel, Yeah!
87,Joey," Yeah, you fogged Danny."
88,Rachel, Please! We did not fog Danny! Who's Danny?
89,Joey," Dan just moved in downstairs. Yeah, he just got back from like this
four-month trek in the Andes. Nice fella. "
90,Monica," Oh he's nice. He's nice! Y'know, you always stick up for the people we
fog!"
93,Rachel," Hi! You might not remember us, but we are the girls that fogged
you."
94,Monica, We're-we're really sorry we fogged you.
97,Rachel," Hi! Just so you know, we-we didn't mean to fog you, we thought
you were like a yeti or something."
101,Rachel," Hi! Sorry to bother you, but I don't think we can accept your
acceptance of our apology, it just doesn't really seem like you mean it."
102,Monica, Yeah.
105,Monica, Wow! That guy is so rude!
106,Rachel, Really! What is with that guy? I mean you'd forgive me if I fogged you.
107,Monica, Well you did a little bit.
108,Rachel," Oh my God, honey, I'm so sorry!"
109,Monica, I totally forgive you!
110,Rachel, Really?
111,Monica, Yes!
113,Phoebe, Hey!
114,Monica, Hey!
115,Phoebe," So listen, you know my friend Chris who owns the crematorium? "
116,Monica, Crematorium Chris? Sure!
117,Phoebe," He says, that he would cremate my fur coat for free if I umm, y'know,
bring in the next person I know who dies."
119,Rachel," Oh my God! Oh my God, look at these pelts!"
120,Monica," Don't get too attached, she's having it cremated."
121,Rachel," What? Uhh, Phoebe, honey, honey, I know you're quirky and I get a big
kick out of it, we all do actually, but if you destroy a coat like this that is like a
crime against nature! Not nature, fashion!"
122,Phoebe," This is fashion?! (Grabs the coat from Rachel.) Okay, so to you, death
is fashion?! That's really funny. (She puts the coat on and starts to model it.) Here's
Phoebe umm, sporting uh, y'know, cutting edge hairy carcass from y'know, the steal traps
of wintry Russia. I mean, you really thing this looks good? (Sees herself in the
mirror.) 'Cause I do."
124,Ross," (on phone) I know I miss you too. I can't wait to see you. I love you.
Bye. (Hangs up.)"
125,Chandler," Okay, what is in here? Rocks?"
126,Ross," No-no, this is my collection of fossil samples."
127,Chandler," So, rocks. "
129,Ross," I'm really gonna miss this apartment. Y'know, Ben-Ben took his first steps
right over there. (Points.)"
130,Joey," Ohh. Hey, remember when I ran into this thing (The shutters that close off
the kitchen.) and it kinda knocked me out a little?"
131,Ross," I loved this place! To tell you the truth, I wish I didn't have to move."
132,Joey," Uhh, are you saying that you're not entirely happy about this?"
133,Ross," Well, I mean if uh, if Emily gave me a choice…"
134,Joey," You do have a choice!! Ross, why are you listening to her?! Are
you, are you crazy?!"
135,Ross, Why?
136,Joey," It's not right what Emily wants you to do! She is totally-(The gang enters
behind Joey and Phoebe pinches him again.)-Owww!! Stop pinching me! Look, now you guys
said I only had to keep my mouth shut as long as Ross was happy, right? Well he just told
me that he's not entirely happy."
137,Ross, What's going on?
138,Joey, We all hate Emily!
139,Phoebe, Nooo!!
140,Monica," No, Ross, we do not hate Emily. We-we just, we just think that you're
having to sacrifice a whole lot to make her happy."
141,Joey, Yeah!
142,Chandler," Look, we just think that maybe she's being a little unreasonable."
143,Joey, Yes! Yes! Unreasonable!
144,Ross," Unreasonable? How about we have this conversation when one of you guys
gets married! You have no idea what it takes to make a marriage work! All right,
it's about compromise! Do you always like it? No! Do you do it? Yes! Because it's not all
laughing, happy, candy in the sky, drinking coffee at Central Perk all the time! It's real
life, okay? It's what grown-ups do! (He storms out.)"
145,Phoebe, I think he's right. You guys hang out at the coffeehouse way too much.
148,Monica," God, I feel so guilty about Ross."
149,Phoebe," Oh, I know."
150,Joey, I kinda feel like it's my fault.
152,Chandler," Kind of? If you just kept this to yourself none of this would've
happened."
153,Joey," Well, I'm keeping so many things to myself these days, something was bound
to slip out! (He glares at Chandler.)"
154,Chandler," Well, I think it's very brave what you said."
156,Phoebe," All right, I can't sit here anymore. I have to walk places. (She puts on
her fur coat.)"
157,Chandler," Pheebs, what are you doing with the coat? How about the whole animal
rights thing?"
158,Phoebe," Well, I've been reading up and for your information, minks are not very
nice. Okay, I admit it! I love this coat! Okay, I—it's the best thing I've ever had
wrapped around me, including Phil Huntley! (She starts to leave but stops and says to
Monica.) Remember Phil Huntley? He was fine!"
160,Rachel, Hi!
162,Rachel, What? Yeti—I mean Danny?
164,Rachel," Oh. Listen, I'm so sorry. I would, I would've never fogged you if y'know
if you hadn't looked so…. Y'know."
166,Rachel, (shocked) What?
168,Rachel, What? Hey! No-no-no! This not cool! You don't even know me!
170,Rachel," So from that you think you've got me all figured out? Well, you don't!
Y'know I-I could have toys for underprivileged kids in here!"
172,Rachel," Well, y'know, if-if kids like to play with Capri pants."
174,Rachel, And stop saying that! I hate that!
177,Rachel," Fine! I judged you. I made a snap judgement. But you did it too! And you
are worse because you are sticking to your stupid snap judgement! You can't even open up
your mind for a second to see if you're wrong! What does that say about you?"
179,Rachel, What?!
181,Rachel, Okay. Okay.
184,Chandler," Uh, Ross?"
185,Phoebe, Are you still mad at us?
186,Ross, Yep.
187,Phoebe," Oh good! Because we have an ""I'm sorry"" song."
188,Ross, Y'know what? I'm really not in the mood.
189,Joey," Look, Ross, I feel really bad. I mean, you're going through all this stuff
and I just acted like a jerk."
190,Chandler," Yeah, we are so sorry."
191,Phoebe," (To Chandler) You're kinda stepping on the song. (She gets ready to play
but is stopped by…)"
192,Joey," Look, we were way out of line, we totally support you."
193,Monica," Whatever you decide, whatever you do."
194,Phoebe," Okay, now you're just taking lines right out of the song!"
195,Ross," Look, this is hard enough! I really need you guys right now."
196,Phoebe, Yes! Exactly! And that's why…
198,Monica, Why don't you come over tonight? And I'll make you favorite dinner.
199,Ross, Okay. Thanks you guys. Pheebs are you wearing fur?
200,Phoebe," Okay, let's get some perspective people; it's not like I'm wearing a
seeing-eye dog coat!"
202,Joey," Hey, y'know Ross, I think I kinda understand why I kinda lost it today."
203,Ross," You do, huh?"
204,Joey," Yeah you see umm, well, I'm an actor. Right? So I gotta keep my emotions
right at the surface y'know? See what I'm saying? I gotta lot of balls in the air. (Makes
like he's juggling.) Y'know what I mean? It's tough! Guys like me, y'know, you wander
around, you're alone…"
205,Ross, What are you talking about?
206,Joey, (thinks) I'm not sure.
207,Rachel, (entering) Hi!
208,Monica," Hey, look at you! Where have you been?"
209,Rachel," Oh, I went to have pizza. With Danny."
210,Monica, How did that happen?
211,Rachel, That yeti is one smooth talker.
212,Monica," I hope you're not full, 'cause dinner's almost ready."
213,Rachel," Yeah, y'know I-I think I'm just gonna hang out in my room."
215,Rachel," Come on you guys! Listen, if Emily knew I was here having dinner you
with you she would flip out and you know it. It's okay, I really… I don't mind."
216,Ross," Wait! Wait! Wait! Y'know what? Just stay. Please? It uh… It would
really mean a lot to me if you stayed."
217,Rachel," Ross, I…"
218,Joey, RACHEL PLEASE!!! JUST HAVE DINNER WITH US!!!
219,Rachel," Okay. Okay. Joey, it's okay. Settle down."
220,Joey," All right, I-I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You see Rach I'm an actor…"
222,Ross," Hey! Hey, look! Ugly Naked Guy's back!"
224,Rachel, I haven't seen him in so long!
225,Phoebe," Oh God, I really missed that fat bastard!"
227,Monica," Wow, this is so weird. I just realized this might be the last time we'll
all be hanging out together."
228,Joey, It's almost as if he knew.
230,Monica," I'll get it. (On phone.) Hello. (Listens.) Hi Emily! (Listens.) Yeah, uh
you-you tracked him down. Hold on one second. (She hands the phone to Ross.)"
231,Ross," Hey! (Listens.) Yeah-yeah, we're just having dinner. (Listens.) Uh, yeah,
sure uh hold on. (To the gang.) She wants to say hi. (To Emily) Hold on."
233,Phoebe, Hi Emily!
234,Chandler, Hi!
236,Joey," Well uh, I don't know about who's here, but I can tell you for damn sure
who's not here and that's Rachel!!"
239,Ross," Y'know what? Uh, Rachel is here! (Rachel stops.)"
241,Chandler," Oh yeah, there-there she is!"
242,Ross," Yeah, yeah, she's here."
245,Ross, (on phone) Hi.
247,Ross," (going onto the patio) Look Emily, I'm just having dinner with my friends,
okay?"
249,Ross," Emily that's ridiculous. Look, I'm-I'm moving for you, I'm cutting friends
out of my life for you. Please, just get on the plane and come to New York. Okay, you'll
see you're the only person I want to be with."
251,Ross," Well, you can't know where I am all the time. Look, this marriage is never
gonna work if you don't trust me."
253,Ross," So, can you trust me?"
258,Joey, I think it's going okay. Looks like he's smiling.
259,Monica, How can you tell? You can only see the back of his head!
260,Joey," You can totally tell! Here look, watch me. (He stands up and turns his
back to them so that he is facing the window.) Smile! Frown. Smile! Frown. (The camera
cuts to Ross outside hanging up the phone.) Smile! (Ross turns around and sees Joey
alternately smiling and frowning and just stares at him for a second and heads back
inside.)"
261,Ross," Well, I guess that's it."
263,Joey, What happened? What happened?
264,Ross, My marriage is over.
266,Monica," Oh, sweetie. Oh, look at you. You're shivering."
267,Phoebe, Here. (She wraps her coat around his shoulders.)
268,Rachel," Ross, honey, is there anything we can do?"
269,Ross, Yeah. You can help me get my furniture back from Gunther.
272,Phoebe," (to the squirrel) Okay, stop tormenting me! This mink! Okay, they're
mean! And they hate squirrels! And y'know, okay, most of these probably wanted to be
coats! (The squirrel stares at her.) All right, fine, now I get it. (To the clerk.) Here.
(She hands him her coat.) You take it. (To the squirrel.) Are you happy now? I'm cold!"
0,Chandler, Are you looking at naked tribe's women?
1,Joey," No, look. (Shows him the magazine.)"
2,Chandler, That's a pig.
3,Joey," I know, I know, but look at the knobs on her."
5,Chandler, Hey! (Joey quickly hides the magazine under the couch.)
6,Ross, Emily's cousin kicked me out!
7,Chandler, What?! 
8,Joey, Why?
9,Ross," Well, when you're subletting an apartment from your wife's cousin and then
you get a divorce, sometimes the cousin suddenly wants his apartment back."
10,Chandler, How can he do that? Didn't you sign a lease?
11,Ross, Who needs a lease when it's family!
12,Joey," Hey, you can stay with us! We'll take care of ya!"
13,Chandler," Oh, yeah! Absolutely! Anything you need man! But you have to promise
me the second you are feeling better so that we can make fun of your hair!"
14,Joey, Yeah.
15,Ross, You got it.
16,Joey, Okay.
17,Ross," Thanks you guys, I really appreciate this. All right, I'm gonna get
packing again. Man, I've been moving around so much I'm beginning to feel like a nomad."
19,Ross, What?
20,Chandler, He thought you said gonad.
25,Monica," Oh, Larry."
26,Phoebe," Umm, do health inspectors work on commission? "
29,Phoebe, It's okay to laugh right?
31,Phoebe, Okay. (She laughs harder.)
33,Monica," Okay, knock yourself out, Larry."
35,Phoebe, Yum-my!
36,Monica, Larry?
37,Phoebe, Oh yeah! I'd let him check out my kitchen floors.
39,Monica," Uh, look, Larry honey, umm, I wrote the book on Section 5 and I know
that you don't have to wear your hat unless you're in the kitchen."
41,Monica," It's in the kitchen, I'll go get it. "
44,Phoebe," Hey, you should really read that book you wrote. (To Larry) Wow! You saw
the hat in the kitchen and knew that she'd have to go in there hatless to get it.
You can have your own health inspector detective show!"
46,Phoebe," Yeah, but then I can be you sidekick Vunda."
48,Phoebe," Okay, she would love that! Y'know, 'cause you know all the clean places
to eat."
50,Phoebe, Okay.
52,Phoebe, He's so funny! (She imitates what he just did.)
54,Monica, Thanks.
55,Rachel, Thank you. (To Monica) Mon?
56,Monica, Hmm?
57,Rachel, How's Ross doing? Y'know since all the Emily stuff.
58,Monica," He's not great umm, but he's dealing with it. Oh wait a minute, you're
not gonna try…"
59,Rachel," Oh, honey, please, no, I can't get started with all that Ross stuff
again. I mean, he's gonna screwed up for a looong time. And besides y'know, I don't, I
don't go for guys right after they get divorced."
60,Monica," Right, you only go for them 5 minutes before they get married."
63,Monica, (To Monica) Danny. Are you guys ever gonna go out again?
64,Rachel," I don't know! He hasn't called me since that one time when we went out.
I see him in the hallway, we flirt, I'm all ha-ha-ha-ha, and nothing."
66,Rachel, Hi Danny! (Notices his box of liquor he's carrying.) Wow! Thirsty huh?
68,Monica," Ohh, fun!"
69,Rachel," Ohh, great!"
71,Rachel, Yeah.
73,Monica," Well, I guess we won't be warming his house."
74,Rachel," (laughs) Okay. All right, I see what he's doing! He's not asking me out,
because he wants me to ask him out."
75,Monica, And you're not gonna do that.
76,Rachel," That's right! 'Cause that would give him the control! So now he's
all ooh, coming up with this whole I've got a party thing y'know, trying to get me to hint
around for an invitation. Blew up in his face, didn't it?"
77,Monica, So-so there is no party.
78,Rachel," No, there's a party. There's a party. But the power, that is still up
for grabs. You follow me?"
79,Monica," I think so. Se, he-he's not inviting you to his party because he likes
you."
80,Rachel, Exactly.
82,Joey, Ross?
83,Ross, (entering from the bathroom) Hey roomies!
84,Chandler, Love what you've done with the place.
85,Ross," Oh, yeah I know, I know, it's a lot of boxes, but again I really
appreciate you guys letting me stay here."
86,Joey," Not a problem. And listen, hey! Since you're gonna be here for a while,
why don't—I was thinking we uh, put your name on the answering machine."
87,Chandler, Oh yeah!
88,Ross," Oh, I uh, hope you don't mind, I kinda uh, jazzed it up a little. Check
this out. (He plays the greeting, and We Will Rock You starts to play and Ross's
voice comes over it.) We will, we will, call you back!"
89,Joey," Hey, all right!"
90,Ross," Pretty cool, huh?"
92,Joey," (To Chandler) You're fake laughing too, right?"
93,Chandler," Oh, the tears are real."
96,Phoebe, (smiles) Show me the badge again.
98,Phoebe, Shiny. 
100,Phoebe, (laughing) You are just nonstop!
103,Phoebe, Why?!
105,Phoebe, (awed) You have the power to do that?
107,Phoebe, (excited) Shut it down.
109,Joey, Hey.
110,Chandler, What are you doing?
111,Joey, Nothing.
112,Chandler, You built a fort didn't ya?
113,Joey, (smiles) Kinda.
114,Chandler," (notices something) Oh my God, the air purifier! Ross's air purifier!
All I heard through 4 years of college was (makes a humming noise.)"
115,Joey," Dude, you should've gone out once and a while."
116,Chandler, I hate this thing!
117,Joey," Come on, Chandler, Ross is our friend. He needs us right now, so why don't
you be a grown up and come and watch some TV in the fort!"
119,Rachel," Oh, hi Danny."
121,Monica," Oh, thanks! We'll try to stop by."
122,Rachel," Uh, actually, I think I'm gonna be busy."
123,Monica, You are?
124,Rachel," Yeah! Remember I got that uh, gala."
126,Rachel," It's a uh, regatta gala."
128,Rachel," No-no, but I support it."
130,Monica, Okay.
132,Rachel, Okay. (Closes the door.) Walked right into that one didn't he?
133,Monica, What one? You wanted him to invite you to the party and he did it!
134,Rachel," Yeah, but he waited until the last minute! So if I said yes, he would
know I had nothing better to do than wait around for an invitation to his stupid party. I
said, ""No!"" Which puts me right back in the driver seat."
135,Monica, Great. So the ball is in his court?
136,Rachel, Ball? There is no ball.
138,Ross," (glaring at him) Joey, please! (Motions to his computer.)"
139,Joey, Sorry.
141,Joey, Ahhhhhhhhhh… 
143,Chandler, (entering) Hello children!
144,Joey, Hey! Wanna play some foosball? Please?
145,Chandler, Okay. (Starts to head for where the foosball table usually is.)
146,Joey," No-no, no! We have to move the table into my room, yeah! 'Cause of all the
boxes. Come on!"
148,Joey," All right, I have one question. What is the deal with this?
(Imitates Ross's 'quiet down' maneuver, but does move his hands up and down he just flaps
his hands as if he's waving good-bye.)"
149,Chandler, Bye-bye little puppet Joey hand?
150,Joey," No, the quiet down thing!"
151,Chandler, You mean this. (Does the maneuver perfectly.)
152,Joey," Um-hmm! Look, I-I-I don't know how much more of this I can take! Did you
know he taped over my Baywatch tape with some show about bugs! My God! What if that
had been porn?"
153,Chandler," (gasps) All right look, y'know, this maybe tough but come on, this is
Ross! I survived college with him!"
154,Joey," All right, I guess I can hold out a little longer. Let's have a game."
155,Chandler, Okay.
157,Chandler, No-no-no-no!
158,Joey, YES!!
159,Ross," (entering) Uh fellas, (Does the maneuver and gives them a double thumbs
up, which Chandler returns as he closes the door.)"
160,Chandler," Okay, so he's out of here."
161,Joey, Um-hmm.
164,Joey, (entering) Hey!
165,Monica, Hey!
166,Joey," You guys got anything to eat? I just went down to Johnos for some chicken
and it was closed!"
167,Phoebe," Oh, I took Larry there to eat but it was all violated. So we shut it
down!"
168,Joey," Pheebs, if this guy keeps closing down all of our favorite places, where
are we gonna eat?!"
169,Monica," I don't know, clean places?"
170,Joey," Umm, yum!"
172,Monica, (looking through the peephole) It's Danny.
173,Rachel, Don't let him in! I'm supposed to be at a regatta gala.
174,Monica," (to Danny) We'll be right there! (To Rachel) Can't you just say it
starts later?"
175,Rachel, What? What kind of a regatta gala starts at night?!
176,Monica, The fake kind! 
179,Monica, We have a ladle. (Gives him one.)
181,Monica," Okay, great! "
183,Phoebe," Hey, guys, you know what Larry would say? He would say, ""See you
ladle."" (Laughs.)"
185,Chandler," Well, I-I-I'm done with this. You want anything Ross? Sports?
International? Apartment listings?"
186,Ross, I'll take sports.
187,Joey, Mine! (He grabs it.)
188,Ross," All right. Uhh, international."
189,Joey, Oh that's mine too! (Grabs it and Ross looks at him.) I'm Italian!
190,Ross," Well, I guess I can check out those apartment listings, even though
there's never anything in here."
191,Chandler, Not even on page 7?
192,Ross," (looks) Oh yeah! You're—hey, you're right! Here's an affordable
place, (reading ad) two bedroom, close to work, ooh, it's available in five weeks!"
193,Chandler, What about that circled one?
194,Ross," Oh, I-I don't know, it's kind of expensive for a studio."
195,Joey, But it's available now! Isn't it?
196,Chandler," Yes, it is."
197,Joey," Hey, let's go look at it! (They both jump up.)"
198,Ross," Okay, let's go."
199,Joey, Okay!
200,Chandler, There we go!
201,Ross," Oh-oh-ooh, hey guys, I was wondering if you guys would uh, maybe chip in
on some new air filters for the air purifier? I mean after all, we all are using it."
202,Chandler, Let's go quicker.
203,Joey, Yeah!
205,Ross," Oh my God! (Looking around, which doesn't take him long.)"
206,Chandler," Yeah, well look at this kitchen, slash bathroom. Well that's great!
Y'know so you can cook while in the tub."
207,Joey," Somebody was using his head. Hey, let's check out the rest of the place."
209,Ross," I think this is it. I don't know, maybe we should keep looking."
210,Joey," But hey, Ross, this place is available now!"
211,Chandler," Yeah, you don't want to be stuck with us for the next five weeks."
212,Joey, Yeah.
214,Ross," (To Joey) So, you-you think I should go ahead and take this place?"
215,Joey," Oh, it's perfect!"
216,Ross, (To Chandler) How about you?
217,Chandler, It's a kitchen slash bathroom.
218,Ross," All right, I see what you guys are saying. I'll uh, I'll go downstairs and
fill out an application."
220,Chandler, We are bad people.
221,Joey," He knew we were trying to get rid of him. He knew! (Pause.) You think we
could get a bathtub in our kitchen?"
224,Phoebe," Ooh, absolutely!"
226,Phoebe," Ooh, I love that place! (Thinks about it.) So, no."
228,Phoebe, Enh. Sure!
230,Phoebe," Oh, no-no, this place is totally healthy! That—this milk is mine. I
bought this today, 'cause I was thirsty for milk, y'know. (She takes a swig of it, but has
to turn away from him as she makes a face to show that it has gone bad.) Okay, let's go!"
235,Phoebe," Okay, stop! Larry, okay, can't you just be Larry and not Larry the
health inspector guy? Y'know I mean it was really exciting at first but now it's like,
okay, so where are we gonna eat ever?"
237,Phoebe," Thank you. (To Gunther, who's standing there frozen) Okay, go! Go! Go!
(He runs off.) (To Larry) Now, if after dinner you still really need to bust someone, I
know a hot dog vendor who picks his nose."
239,Joey," Maybe, maybe we did a good thing, helping Ross get back on his feet!"
240,Chandler, Yes that was a nice place!
241,Joey, Yeah!
242,Chandler," Not a lot of closet space, but he can just hang his stuff out the
window in a bag!"
243,Joey, Yeah!
245,Chandler, What are we gonna do?
246,Joey, I don't know. Maybe pizza?
247,Chandler, About Ross!
248,Joey, Oh! Oh!
250,Joey," Hello! (Listens.) Oh yeah! (To Chandler) It's the apartment manager; Ross
put us down as references. (To the apartment manager.) Ross is the greatest guy you'll
ever meet! Yeah, he's very reliable."
251,Chandler," (grabbing the phone) Of course he has this big huge dog! That uh,
barks into the night. (Listens.) Well, who doesn't love dogs? (Thinks.) Ah, he's a tap
dancer! (Listens.) Yes, some would say that is a lost art. (Thinks.) He's a pimp!
(Listens.) There you go! Yes, he's a pimp. He's a big, tap dancing pimp! (Pause.) Hello? "
253,Chandler, Ohhhhh!
256,Rachel," Shoot, shoot, this is never gonna work! He's right there!"
257,Monica, Just go over and say hi.
258,Rachel," No, I have to go downstairs and come back up as if I'm coming home from
the regatta gala. Okay? So just go distract him. But don't be sexy."
260,Monica," Hey, Danny!"
262,Monica," (turns his back to the stairs) Oh, it's a great party! Great food.
Y'know, most parties it's all chips and salsa, chips and salsa. (As she's saying this
Rachel tries to head downstairs but is blocked by people coming upstairs. She quickly
retreats back up the stairs.) (Sees that she has to keep him distracted longer.) So umm,
what's this? (Points to his plate.)"
264,Monica," Ooooh! (Rachel now succeeds in getting downstairs.) And-and-and
what-what's this? (Points again.)"
267,Monica, (upon seeing Rachel she points) Oh.
269,Rachel," Hey! Oh right, tonight was your party."
271,Rachel," Oh well, y'know, the gala had to end sometime."
273,Rachel," Yeah, sure. (To Monica) All right, whose court is the ball in now?"
274,Monica, I thought there wasn't a ball?
275,Rachel," Oh, come on! He's glad that I came, he doesn't want me to go anywhere,
balls flying all over the place!"
277,Rachel," Oh, go on! You telling people about me?"
280,Rachel," (laughs) Yeah, okay, at ease solider!"
282,Rachel," No, it's all right, you can just drop the act Tommy. I know what's going
on here. Your Danny's wingman right? You guys are best buds. Frat bros!"
284,Rachel," Yeah, yeah, you go talk to your friend. You tell him, ""Nice
try."""
286,Rachel," Man! He just keeps lobbing them up and I just keep knocking them right
out of the park!"
287,Monica, I think I need a drink.
288,Rachel, Yeah!
291,Chandler," 98. 99. 100. Okay, go!"
292,Joey," (getting up) Dude, I'm telling ya! I'm fine! (He tries to take a step and
falls flat on his face.)"
294,Chandler, Here we go! Here we go!
296,Joey, Hey!
297,Chandler, Hey!
298,Ross," Hey. So I uh, I didn't get that apartment. Some problem with my
application."
299,Joey, You're kidding!
300,Chandler," You're kidding, no!"
301,Ross," Yeah. But, the good news is that Phoebe said that I could stay at her
place for a while. So…"
302,Joey," But you can't stay with Phoebe, Ross! We're-we're roomies! "
303,Ross," Look, you guys don't need me here taking up your space."
304,Joey," Well, we got plenty of space! There-there's still some over there (Points
to where the window is but sees that there isn't any space there and points towards his
door.) by-by that speaker. Please, just stay!"
305,Chandler, Yeah!
306,Ross, Are you guys sure about this?
307,Joey, Definitely!
308,Chandler," Yes! Ross, you have to stay!"
309,Ross, All right.
310,Joey, All right!
311,Chandler," All right, buddy!"
312,Ross," So I'm a pimp huh? It's okay! Look, I know that sometimes I can be a pain
in the ass, but you just have to talk to me. Tell me if something is bothering you. Okay?
And for my part I will do everything I can to keep my annoying habits just (Does the
'quiet down' maneuver)."
316,Chandler," Well, I see you've had a very productive day. Don't you think the
cowboy hat is a little much?"
317,Ross," (popping up behind Joey wearing an Indian headdress) Come on, it's fun!"
318,Chandler," All right! (He joins them in the fort and comes up putting on a
bonnet.) Isn't this a woman's hat?"
319,Joey," Dude, stop talking crazy and make us some tea!"
0,Rachel," Oh Monica that was the best Thanksgiving dinner ever! I think you
killed us."
1,Ross, I couldn't possibly eat another bite. 
2,Joey, I need something sweet.
3,Phoebe, Does anyone wanna watch TV?
6,Phoebe, Monica your remote doesn't work.
7,Monica," Phoebe, you have to lift it and point."
8,Phoebe," Oh. Aw, forget it."
9,Rachel," Yeah, you know what we should all do? We should play that game where
everyone says one thing that they're thankful for."
10,Joey," Ooh-ooh, I! I am thankful for this beautiful fall we've been having."
11,Monica, That's very nice.
12,Chandler," That's sweet, Joey."
13,Joey," Yeah, the other day I was at the bus-stop and this lovely fall breeze came
in out of nowhere and blew this chick's skirt right up. Oh! Which reminds me, I'm also
thankful for thongs. (Note Actually, I think every guy is thankful for thongs.
That and spandex. J )"
16,Joey," I mean, it's not so much an underpant as it is a feat of engineering. I
mean, it's amazing how much they can do with so little material! And the way they play
with your mind! Is it there? Is it not there?"
17,Chandler, Are you aware that you're still talking?
18,Monica, Is anyone thankful for anything else besides a thong?
19,Ross," Huh, I don't know what to pick. Am I more thankful for my divorce or my
eviction? Hmm."
20,Phoebe," Wow! See, and I didn't think you'd be able to come up with anything."
21,Ross, I'm sorry. It's just that this is the worse Thanksgiving ever.
22,Chandler," No-no-no! I am the king of bad Thanksgivings. You can't just
swoop in here with your bad marriage and take that away from me."
23,Rachel," Oh, you're not gonna tell the whole story about how your parents got
divorced again are you?"
24,Ross," Oh God, no."
25,Joey," Oh, come on! I wanna hear it! It wouldn't be Thanksgiving without Chandler
bumming us out!"
26,Chandler," It's a tradition, like the parade. If the parade decided it was gay,
moved out, and abandoned its entire family."
34,Ross, You're right. Yours is worse. You are the king of bad Thanksgivings.
35,Phoebe, I don't know about that. I've got one that's worse.
36,Chandler," Really? Worse than, ""More turkey Mr. Chandler?"""
37,Phoebe," Oh, did the little rich boy have a problem with the butler? Yes, mine's
worse!"
43,Ross," In this life, Phoebe."
44,Phoebe," Oh, this life! Oh okay no, Chandler's is worse."
45,Joey," Man, it must be so cool remembering stuff like that! I don't have any past
life memories."
46,Phoebe, Of course you don't sweetie. You're brand new.
47,Rachel, I know Monica's worst Thanksgiving.
48,Monica," Oh, let's not tell this story."
50,Phoebe," Oh no, I know! I know! It's the one where Joey got Monica's turkey stuck
on his head!"
51,Rachel, What?! Joey got a turkey stuck on his head?!
52,Joey," Hey, it's not like it sounds."
53,Chandler, It's exactly like it sounds.
56,Joey, (muffled) Hello?
57,Phoebe, (surprised) Hello?
58,Joey, Phoebe?
59,Phoebe, Joey? What's going on?
60,Joey, Look. (He walks out of the bathroom with his head stuck in a huge turkey.)
61,Phoebe, Oh my God!
62,Joey, I know! It's stuck!!!
63,Phoebe, (walks him to the kitchen) Easy. Step. How did it get on?
64,Joey, I put it on to scare Chandler!
65,Phoebe, Oh my God! Monica's gonna totally freak out!
66,Joey," Well then help me get it off! Plus, it smells really bad in here."
67,Phoebe," Well, of course it smells really bad. You have your head up a dead
animal."
69,Monica, (entering) Hey!
70,Phoebe, Hey!
71,Monica," Hey, did you get the turkey basted—Oh my God! Oh my God! (She sees
someone is stuck in the turkey.) Who is that?"
72,Joey, It's Joey.
73,Monica, What-what are you doing? Is this supposed to be funny?
74,Phoebe," No, it's not supposed to be funny, it's supposed to be scary."
75,Monica," Well, get it off now!"
76,Joey, I can't! It-it's stuck!
77,Monica," Well, I don't care! That-that turkey has to feed 20 people at my
parent's house and they're not gonna eat it off your head!"
78,Phoebe," All right, hold on! Okay, let's just all think."
80,Monica," Okay, I got it. Phoebe? All right, you pull. I'm gonna spread the legs
as wide as I can. (Joey starts giggling.) Joey? Now is not the time!"
81,Joey, Sorry! Sorry.
83,Monica," Okay, count to three. 1. 2. 3!"
85,Chandler," Arghhhhhh!! (Joey turns around to taunt him, but Chandler is in the
doorway and Joey is facing the kitchen.)"
86,Joey," (pointing) It worked! I scared ya, I knew it! Ha-ha!"
87,Chandler, I'm over here big guy.
88,Joey," (turning all the way around, and still not facing Chandler) Yeah, you are!
(Starts dancing.) I scared you!"
91,Chandler, (laughing) You did look like an idiot.
92,Joey," Hey, I wasn't the only one who looked like an idiot. All right? Remember
when Ross tried to say, ""Butternut squash?"" And it came out, ""Squatternut
buash?"""
93,Ross, Yeah that's the same.
94,Monica, That's it. That's my worse Thanksgiving.
95,Phoebe," Oh wait! That can't be the one Rachel's talking about. She didn't even
know that happened. So which one was it?"
97,Monica," Umm, I-I really don't want to tell this story."
98,Chandler," Oh, come on Monica, reliving past pain and getting depressed is what
Thanksgiving is all about. Y'know, for me anyway. And of course, the Indians."
99,Monica," Look umm, of all people, you do not want me to tell this story!"
103,Monica," I'll get it! (She runs in, and she's her old fat self like The One With
The Prom Video. Not only that, she's out of breath after running a short distance. She
goes over and opens the door to reveal Rachel with her old nose.) Happy Thanksgiving!"
112,Ross, (entering) Hey! 
115,Ross," Uh, everyone, this is Chandler! My roommate and lead singer of our band!"
117,Ross," Oh, this is Monica."
119,Chandler, (seeing her) Okay.
121,Ross," Oh, mom. Mom. Chandler hates Thanksgiving and doesn't eat any Thanksgiving
food."
124,Chandler," Well, as long as the pilgrims didn't eat it, I'm in."
128,Ross," So uh, Rach? Does it, does it feel weird around here now? Y'know since
I've been away at college."
130,Ross," Well, that's cool. So did… (She walks away from him and he shuts up.)"
135,Ross," Umm, I'm sorry Judy, I couldn't find that bowl that you and Jack were
looking for."
137,Ross, (in a high pitched voice) Monica!
140,Chandler," Oh yeah, it was great. You should be a chef."
151,Ross," So I’m thinking about asking Rachel out tonight. Y'know maybe play
her that song we wrote last week."
152,Chandler, Emotional Knapsack?
153,Ross, Yeah.
154,Chandler," Right on! Oh! Uh, but, don’t take to long okay? 'Cause uh, we're
gonna test out our fake ID's tonight, right Clifford Alverez."
155,Ross," Listen, Roland Chang, if things go well, I’m gonna be out with her
all night."
156,Chandler," Dude, don't do that too me!"
158,Ross," All right, it's cool you can stay here. My parents won't mind."
160,Chandler," No, it's not that, I just don't want to be stuck here all night with
your fat sister."
161,Ross, Hey!
168,Chandler, I called you fat?! I don't even remember that!
169,Monica," Well, I do."
170,Chandler," I am so sorry. I really am. I was an idiot back then. I rushed the
stage at a Wham concert for crying out loud!"
171,Phoebe," Oh, I can't believe you called her fat."
172,Ross, I can't believe you let George Michael slap you.
173,Chandler," I am really sorry. That is so terrible. I am so, so sorry."
174,Rachel," Actually, y'know that's not the Thanksgiving I was talking about."
175,Monica," Yes, it was!"
176,Rachel," No, it wasn't. It was actually the…"
177,Monica," (interrupting her) Okay, now Thanksgiving's over, let's get ready for
Christmas. Who wants to go get a Christmas tree?!"
178,Phoebe," Oh, no, I have the cutest Christmas story!"
179,Chandler, We wanna hear Monica's Thanksgiving story!
180,Phoebe," Fine, all right, mine had a dwarf that got broke in half, but y'know
whatever."
184,Rachel," Oh, yeah, I had too. There was never any parking by the Psychology
building."
186,Rachel, Oh hi!
191,Rachel," No, God! Please, let me! (Runs out.)"
193,Rachel, Hey!
194,Ross, Hey. (To his parents) Happy Thanksgiving! 
196,Chandler," Yeah, we were just talking about that. I can't believe how stupid we
used to look. (They both quickly push their sleeves over their elbows.)"
197,Ross," So uh, where's Monica?"
200,Monica," Hi, Chandler."
201,Chandler, Oh my God!
202,Monica," What-what's the matter? Is there, is there something on my dress? (She
turns around making sure he gets a good look.)"
203,Chandler," You just, you look so different! Terrific! That dress! That body!"
204,Ross, Dude!
205,Chandler, Sorry!
207,Ross," Oh mom! Okay, umm, her name is Carol. And she's really pretty. And smart.
And uh, she's-she's on the lacrosse team and the golf team. Can you believe it? She plays
for both teams!"
208,Monica," So Chandler, I guess I'll see you at dinner."
211,Chandler, Sorry.
213,Rachel," (entering) Oh-ho, my God! That was so awesome! You totally got him back
for calling you fat! He was just drooling all over you. That must've felt so great!"
214,Monica, Well it didn't!
215,Rachel, What?!
216,Monica," Yeah, I mean yeah, I look great. Yeah, I feel great and yeah, my heart
is not in trouble anymore! Blah, blah, blah! Y'know I still don't feel like I got him
back, y'know? I just want to humiliate him. I wanna, I want him to be like naked and then
I'm going to point at him and laugh!"
217,Rachel," Okay, that we may be able to do."
218,Monica, How?
219,Rachel, Well guys tend to get naked before they're gonna have sex.
220,Monica," What?! I mean, I didn't work this hard and-and-and lose all this weight
so that I can give my flower to someone like him!"
221,Rachel," Okay, first of all, if you keep calling it that, no one's gonna ever
take it. Then, second of all you're not actually gonna have sex with him! You're just
gonna make him think that you are."
222,Monica, Yeah.
223,Rachel, Yeah.
224,Monica," And when he's naked I can throw him out in the front yard and lock the
door and all the neighbors will just humiliate him!"
225,Rachel," Then, you will definitely get him back!"
226,Monica," Okay, so how do I make him think I wanna have sex with him?"
227,Rachel," Okay, oh, here's what you do. Just act like everything around you turns
you on."
228,Monica, What do you mean?
229,Rachel," Well, like anything can be sexy. Like umm, oh-oh, like this dishtowel!
(She grabs it and starts rubbing it on her cheek.) Ooh, ooh, this feels sooo good against
my cheek! And-and if I feel a little hot, I can just dab myself with it. Or I can bring it
down to my side and bring it through my fingers while I talk to him."
230,Monica, (excited) I can do that!
231,Rachel," Yeah? Okay! Good, good, because he's coming. He's coming. (To Chandler)
Hey, what's up? (She leaves and closes the door behind her.)"
232,Chandler," Monica, I was wondering if you can make me some of that righteous mac
and cheese like last year."
233,Monica," Umm, I'd love too! (She goes over and picks up the box and decides to
follow Rachel's advice and holds the box up to her cheek.) Ooh, I love macaroni and
cheese. I love-I love the way this box feels against my cheek."
234,Chandler, Okay.
235,Monica," Boy, I love carrots! Oh! (She picks up a bunch of them and holds them
between her fingers.) Sometimes I like to put them between my fingers like this and-and
hold them down here while I talk to you. (She is rubbing her hip with the carrots.) Umm,
and-and-and y'know if I get really hot umm, I-I like to pick up this knife (She picks up a
knife without putting the box down. She's holding the box between her cheek and shoulder)
and-and umm, I-I put the cold steal against umm, (Pause) my body. (She doesn't have any
exposed skin within reach of the knife, so while holding the carrots in one hand and the
box between her face and shoulder, she rubs the knife on her stomach.)"
236,Chandler, Are you all right?
237,Monica," Oh yeah, of course. I'm fine it's just that—(She drops the box and
in a reflex action tries to catch it with her arm, the knife slips out and slowly flips
through the air and comes point first down into Chandler's shoe.)"
242,Ross," Can you please not do that feet first? You know where his injury is!
Severed toe, you just said it!"
246,Monica," Oh yes! I have it right here, on ice! (She takes a bag of ice out of her
purse and hands it to the doctor.)"
248,Monica, What?! What is it?
250,Chandler, What?
252,Rachel, You brought a carrot?!
254,Monica," God, I'm sorry! I'll go back and get it!"
256,Chandler, Without my toe?! I need my toe!
257,Monica," Wait, no-no-no, I can go really fast! Dad, give me the keys to your Porsche!"
261,Chandler, That's why I lost my toe?! Because I called you fat?!
262,Monica, I didn't mean to cut it off. It was an accident.
263,Chandler, That's why for an entire year people called me Sir Limps-A-Lot?!
264,Monica, I'm sorry! It wasn't your whole toe!
265,Chandler," Yeah, well, I miss the tip! It's the best part. It has the nail. (He
storms out.)"
266,Monica, Chandler! (Follows him out.)
267,Ross," (To Joey) Sir Limps-A-Lot, I came up with that."
268,Joey, You're a dork.
270,Chandler, I can't believe this.
271,Monica," Chandler, I said I was sorry."
272,Chandler," Yeah, well, sorry doesn’t bring back the little piggy that cried
all the way home! I hate this stupid day! And everything about it! I'll see you
later."
273,Monica," Oh wait, Chandler, come here is there anything I can do? Anything?"
274,Chandler," Yeah, just leave me alone for a while. (He goes into his apartment.)"
276,Chandler," Oh-oh, I'm a duck! I go, ""Quack, quack!"" I’m happy all
the time!"
278,Chandler, Nice try.
279,Monica," Wait, wait, wait! (She puts a Shriner's hat on the turkey.)"
280,Chandler," Look, Monica…"
281,Monica," Look! (She puts a big, yellow pair of sunglasses on the bird.)"
282,Chandler, This is not going to work.
283,Monica, I bet this will work! (She starts dancing and Chandler cracks up.)
284,Chandler, You are so great! I love you!
286,Monica, What?
287,Chandler," Nothing! I said, I said ""You're so great"" and then I just, I
just stopped talking!"
288,Monica, You said you loved me! I can't believe this!
289,Chandler, No I didn't!
290,Monica," Yes, you did!"
291,Chandler, No I didn't!
292,Monica, You love me!
293,Chandler, No I don't! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
0,Phoebe, What am I sitting on?
1,Chandler," Top of the world? Dock of the bay? (He tries to think of another but
can't) I'm out."
2,Phoebe, (taking something out of the couch) Ew-eww!! Undies! 
4,Rachel, All right! Who's are they? Who's are they?
5,Ross," Well, they're not mine!"
6,Chandler," Well, they're Joey's! They gotta be Joey's!"
8,Joey," Yeah, they're mine."
9,Chandler, See? They're Joey's! J-J-J-J-J-Joey's!
10,Ross, Why are they here?
11,Joey," I don't know uhh… (Pause as he thinks about it.) Well, I'm Joey.
Yeah, I'm disgusting, I take my underwear off in other people's homes."
12,Rachel," Well, get 'em out of here! What's wrong with you?"
13,Chandler, Yeah!
14,Monica, Yeah!
15,Rachel," (waving them in his face) Take 'em! (Joey makes a noise and jumps out of
the way.) Joey, you can touch them! They're your underwear."
16,Joey, (reluctantly taking them) Chandler? A word.
19,Joey," That's it! I'm tired of covering for you two! This has got to stop!
(Realizes he still has the underwear in his hand.) Ahh! (Throws them towards Chandler's
room.) And tighty-whiteys! What are you, 8?"
20,Monica," (entering) Thank you Joey, thank you so much!"
21,Joey," Oh hey, no, you're not welcome. Okay, look, I hate this! You guys keep
embarrassing me! (To Monica) Yesterday, Rachel found your razor in our bathroom and I
didn't know what to say, so I said it was mine and-and that I was playing a woman in a
play. And one thing led to another and (He puts his leg on the chair and pulls up his
pants leg to reveal that he now has shaved legs.)"
22,Monica," (inspecting his leg) Wow! And around the ankles, y'know that is a tough
spot."
23,Joey," Yeah, it was! All right, listen, I can't…"
24,Chandler, (interrupting him) All this lying has been hard on us too.
25,Joey," Oh-oh, yeah-yeah, I bet all the sex makes it easier!"
26,Chandler," Well, yeah actually."
27,Monica," We'll try to be more careful okay? It's just that, we don't want
everyone to know because this is going really well, and maybe the reason it's going really
well is because it's a secret."
28,Chandler," I know it sounds really weird, but we're just so bad at relationships."
29,Monica, We are! Help us!
30,Chandler, Help!
31,Joey," All right! But, (To Monica) you do it with me once."
32,Monica, Joey!
33,Joey, Didn't think so.
36,Monica," Hey, Phoebe!"
37,Chandler," Hi, Pheebs!"
38,Rachel," Hey, Pheebs!"
39,Joey," Hey, Pheebs!"
40,Rachel, What are you reading?
41,Phoebe," Umm, Wethering Heights. I'm taking a literature class at the New
School and I have to finish it for the first session tomorrow."
42,Chandler, I didn't know you were taking a class. That is so cool.
43,Phoebe," Yeah! Well, I really liked that Lamaze class I took! Y'know and this
time I thought I'd go for something, y'know a little more intellectual, with a less
painful final exam."
44,Rachel, Honey that sounds like fun.
45,Phoebe," Yeah! Ooh, you should come with me! Oh yeah, then I'd have someone to
sit with!"
46,Rachel, Okay.
47,Phoebe," Yeah! Okay—ooh, but are you going to have time to read it?"
48,Rachel," Oh, I read that in high school."
49,Phoebe," This is going to be so much fun! Okay-shhh, I have to finish."
50,Ross," (entering, depressed) Hi."
51,Joey, What's wrong buddy?
52,Ross, Someone at work ate my sandwich!
53,Chandler," Well, what did the police say?"
54,Ross, My Thanksgiving leftover sandwich. I can't believe someone ate it!
55,Chandler," Ross, it's just a sandwich!"
56,Ross," Just a sandwich? Look, I am 30 years old, I'm about to be divorced twice
and I just got evicted! That sandwich was the only good thing going on in my life! Someone
ate the only good thing going on in my life!"
57,Monica," Okay, look, I-I have enough stuff for one more sandwich, I mean I was
going to eat it myself, but (motions that he can have it.)"
58,Ross," (quietly) That-that would be incredible. Thank you so much. I-I still
can't believe someone ate it!! I mean, look, I left a note and everything. "
60,Chandler," (reading) Knock-knock. Who's there? Ross Geller's lunch. Ross Geller's
lunch, who? Ross Geller's lunch, please don't take me. Okay?"
61,Joey, I'm surprised you didn't go home wearing your lunch.
62,Phoebe," Okay, look you wanna hold onto your food? You gotta scare people off. I
learned that living on the street."
63,Ross," Really?! So what would you say Pheebs? Stuff like uh, ""Keep your
mitts off my grub?"""
64,Chandler," Say Ross, when you picture Phoebe living on the street, is she
surrounded by the entire cast of Annie?"
65,Phoebe," Okay, this will keep them away from your stuff. (Writes him a note and
the gang reads it.)"
67,Monica," Phoebe, you are a bad ass!"
68,Phoebe," Someday I'll, tell you about the time I stabbed the cop."
69,Monica, Phoebe?
70,Phoebe," Well, he stabbed me first!!"
72,Rachel," (To Phoebe) Sorry I'm late, but I left late."
73,Phoebe, Okay.
74,Rachel," So Pheebs, what is the book about?"
75,Phoebe, I thought you said you read it in high school.
76,Rachel," Well yeah, but then I remembered I started it and there was this pep
rally and I was, I was on top of the pyramid but anyway—umm, what is this book about?"
77,Phoebe," Okay, umm, it's this tragic love story between Cathy and Heathcliff and
umm, it takes place on like these really creepy mores in England. Which I think
represents the wildness of Heathcliff's character. I totally get symbolism."
79,Rachel," Umm, well I would have to say that it's a, it's tragic love story."
81,Rachel," Oh-oh-oh, symbolism! And uh, the-the uh, wildness of the mores, which I
think is-is mirrored in the wildness of Heathcliff's character."
83,Phoebe, (To Rachel) You completely stole my answer!
84,Rachel," Well, honey that was pretty obvious."
85,Phoebe, Well how would you know?! You didn't even read it!
87,Phoebe," I think that uh, yours is a question with many answers."
89,Phoebe, Would you care to venture one?
91,Phoebe, Are you just repeating what I'm saying?
93,Phoebe, Okay then.
95,Phoebe, Yeah but why didn't you just say that you didn't read the book?!
96,Rachel," Be-because I didn't want him to think I was stupid! I mean, that was
really embarrassing what happened to you!"
97,Ross, (entering) Phoebe! 
98,Phoebe, Yeah?
99,Ross," Phoebe! You're note, amazing! Not only did no one touch my sandwich, but
people at work are actually afraid of me. Yeah, a guy called me mental! Mental Geller,
yeah, I always wanted a cool nickname like that."
100,Monica," Yeah, the best you got in high school was Wet Pants Geller."
101,Ross," That was the water fountain! Okay?! Anyway, people are writing reports for
me, uh pushing back deadlines to meet my schedule, I'm telling you, you get tough with
people you can get anything you want. (Joey walks by with a cup of coffee.) Hey Tribbiani,
give me that coffee! Now!"
105,Joey," So you uh, still wondering?"
107,Joey, You're smart. I like that.
110,Joey," Oh no-no-no-no, wait-wait-wait!!"
112,Joey, Hiya.
113,Rachel," Joey, is what she just said umm—Oh my God. (Looks around the room.)
You were actually gonna… (Chandler picks this moment to return to the living room.)
(Rachel stares in shock.)"
114,Chandler, What is going on here?
115,Rachel," And with Chandler in the next room. What are you, what are you sick?"
117,Joey," I'm Joey. I mean, I'm disgusting. I make low-budget adult films. (Points
at Chandler, angrily.)"
120,Joey," You guys promised you'd be more careful! I mean, come on! The good
Joey name is being dragged through the mud here!"
121,Monica, We're so sorry.
122,Chandler, Yeah.
123,Joey," Well, I'm telling everyone about you! That's the only way to explain the
underwear and the video camera that doesn't make me look like a pig!"
124,Chandler," No-no, wait! There's got to be a better explanation. You can tell them
you had to make an adult film for your (Thinks) adult film class."
125,Joey," Yeah, I like that. But no-no, how does that explain why Rachel found my
underwear at your place?"
126,Chandler, Oh—I don't know.
127,Joey," Well, get ready to come out of the non-gay closet!"
128,Monica," Okay, just wait, please. I promise we'll come up with something. Just
give us a little more time."
129,Joey," All right. Hey, but it better make me look really, really good. (Starts
for his room.) Oh, and another thing, the video camera? Nice!!"
132,Ross," Yeah, of course, Donald."
134,Ross, What?!
136,Ross, (Proudly) Yeah.
138,Ross," Oh no, you-you don't understand. Ugh, this is so silly. Umm, this is all
because of a sandwich."
140,Ross," Yeah. You see my-my sister makes these amazing turkey sandwiches. Her
secret is, she puts a, an extra slice of gravy soaked bread in the middle; I call it the
Moist Maker. Anyway, I-I put my sandwich in the fridge over here… "
142,Ross, What?
144,Ross, You ate my sandwich?
146,Ross," (getting upset) Oh-oh really? Did you confuse it with your own turkey
sandwich with a Moist Maker?"
148,Ross, Do you perhaps seeing a note on top of it?
150,Ross, (getting angry) That said it was my sandwich?!
152,Ross, (jumping to his feet in anger) What?
154,Ross, You-you-you-you (trying to remain in control) threw my sandwich away!
156,Ross," (losing control, we hear him shout outside) MY SANDWICH?!!!"
158,Ross, MY SANDWICH!!!!!! (Ross's scream scares a flight of pigeons away.)
160,Rachel, Hi!
161,Phoebe, Hi!
162,Rachel," (sitting down) So umm, what's this book about?"
163,Phoebe, You didn't read this one either?!
164,Rachel," Well, I was gonna, but I accidentally read something else."
165,Phoebe, What?
166,Rachel," Vogue! Hey, so tell me about this Jane Eyre woman."
167,Phoebe, No! You should've read it yourself!
168,Rachel, Come on Phoebe! Don’t be such a goodie-goodie!
169,Phoebe," Fine! Okay, all right, so Jane Eyre, first of all, you'd think she's a
woman, but she's not. She's a cyborg. "
170,Rachel, A cyborg?! Isn't that like a robot?!
171,Phoebe," Yeah, this book was light years ahead of its time."
173,Phoebe," Umm, Rachel and I were just discussing it and she had some very
interesting insights."
175,Rachel," Uh, thank you Phoebe. Umm, well, what struck me most when reading Jane
Eyre was uh, how the book was so ahead of its time."
177,Rachel," Yeah, well, feminism yes, but also the robots."
179,Chandler, Hey.
180,Monica," Hey. Okay, so umm, since that video camera thing didn't work out uh, I
thought that I would give you just a little preview. (Hands him a Polaroid.)"
181,Chandler, (gasps) You're naked in this picture!
182,Monica, I know.
184,Chandler, Ross?
185,Ross, (in a stupor) Hey Chandler. (Sees Monica.) Monica!
186,Monica," Ross, are you okay?"
187,Ross, I'm fine! I saw a psychiatrist at work today.
188,Monica, Why?!
189,Ross, On account of my rage.
190,Chandler," Which I may say, right now, is out of control."
191,Ross, He gave me a pill for it.
192,Monica, A pill?
193,Ross," Uh-huh. Well, when the psychiatrist told me I had to take a leave of
absence because I yelled at my boss I started to get worked up again, so he offered me a
tranquilizer. And I thought was a good idea so, I took it."
194,Monica," Wait a minute, they're making you take time off work?"
195,Chandler, And you're okay with that?
196,Ross," I don't know. It's going to be weird not having a job for a while, but I,
I definitely don't care about my sandwich."
198,Rachel," (entering, angrily) Ugh, that was so embarrassing! I can't believe you
let me go on and on like that!"
199,Phoebe," (smiling) I'm sorry. It was just so funny when you started comparing Jane
Eyre to Robocop. "
200,Rachel, That was not funny!
201,Phoebe," Well, I snapped! Okay? You weren't taking the class seriously."
202,Rachel," Phoebe, come on! What is the big deal? I thought this was going to be
something we could do together! Y'know, I thought it would be fun!"
203,Phoebe," Well, yeah! Fun is good, but y'know I also wanted to learn. Y'know,
people are always talking about what they learned in high school and I never went to high
school."
204,Rachel," Ohh. Oh, so you really wanted to learn. Yeah, y'know, Pheebs I just
wanted to have fun. Ohh, you know who you should go with?"
206,Monica, (yelling and waving her hand in the air) I know! I know! I know!
210,Rachel, (sees the picture) Oh my God! That's Monica!!
211,Joey, Oh no-no-no! No-no-no-no-no-no-no!
212,Rachel," You get away from me!! You sick, sick, sick, sick-o!!"
213,Ross," (entering, with the rest of the gang) What's going on?"
214,Rachel, Joey has got a secret peephole!
215,Chandler, (Sees the picture) Oh no! No! No! No! (Monica gasps as well.)
216,Rachel," Yes! He has a naked picture of Monica! He takes naked pictures of us!
And then he eats chicken and looks at them!"
218,Rachel, Look! (Shows Ross the picture.)
219,Ross," (covering his eyes) Dude! That's my sister! (She shows the rest of the
gang.)"
220,Monica, (grabbing the picture) Give me that!
221,Phoebe," All right, wait! Just wait. Everybody just calm down. Okay? Let's give
our friend Joey a chance to explain why he's such a big pervert!"
222,Joey," No! I am not a pervert! Okay? It's just… I just…
Kinda…"
223,Chandler," All right, look! Look. I think I can explain this."
225,Joey, Thank you!
226,Chandler, Joey's a sex addict. 
227,Joey," What?!! (He turns around and stares at Chandler who's silently pleading
with Joey to go along with it.) No I'm not!!"
228,Monica, It's okay! It's good! It's good. It's a disease!
229,Joey, No! No! I am not a sex addict!
230,Monica, Yes you are! That's the only way to explain all this stuff!
231,Joey," No it isn't! No, it's not. Because you can also explain it with the truth!"
232,Rachel," Well, what is the truth?"
233,Ross," Yeah, what's going on?"
234,Phoebe, What's going on?
235,Joey, (thinking) I slept with Monica.
236,Chandler, Well let's….let's see what everybody thinks of that?
237,Monica, Oh no!
238,Ross, You slept with my sister?
239,Joey," Uh yes, but it was, we just did it once uh, in London."
240,Ross, This is not good for my rage. (Takes another pill.)
241,Rachel," Monica, is this true?"
242,Joey," Of course it's true! How else would you explain all the weird stuff that's
been going on?"
243,Monica, Yes it's true.
244,Rachel," Okay, but if it only happened that one time, how come we found your
underwear in our apartment the other day?"
245,Joey," Ahh—oy! That was the underwear I was wearing that night in London.
Right Monica?"
246,Monica, I guess I wanted to keep it (Pause) as a souvenir. 
247,Ross, My God Monica!!
248,Chandler, Are you sure Joe? Are you sure you're not just a sex addict?
249,Joey," No! If anyone's a sex addict here, it's Monica! Yeah. Yeah. She has been
trying to get me back in the sack ever since London!"
250,Phoebe, So that's why she gave you a naked picture of herself.
251,Joey, That makes sense!
252,Rachel, And the video camera?
253,Joey," Uhh, Monica?"
254,Monica, I guess I set up the video camera to try and entice Joey.
255,Joey, But sadly I could not be enticed.
256,Ross," Unbelievable! I mean you really kept Joey's underwear?! Why? Why would you
do that?!"
257,Monica, I'm Monica. I'm disgusting. I stalk guys and keep their underpants.
258,Joey," Well, I think we've all learned something about who's disgusting and who's
not. Eh? All right, now, I'm going to get back to my bucket. I'm only eating the skin, so
the chicken's up for grabs. (Offers it to everyone.)"
261,Phoebe," I really thought you making a good point. I mean y'know, until you got
cut off."
263,Phoebe, I don't know! I didn't come with her!
264,Monica," (entering, happily) All right everybody! Everybody guess what? I just
convinced Paul to give us a test next week!"
266,Monica," Come on! Tests make us all better learners! Oh yeah! (Running out) We
should have essay questions!!"

51,Phoebe, 
52,Monica, 
53,Phoebe," Oh, thanks!"
54,Monica, Yeah!
55,Phoebe, Wow!
57,Phoebe, Is that a new Swede jacket? It looks really expensive.
58,Monica, Yeah. I guess. (She puts more money in the bucket.)
59,Phoebe, Just get your nails done?
60,Monica," Yes Phoebe, but this is all I have. Okay? (She pours out the rest of her
change purse into the bucket.)"
61,Phoebe," Okay! Thanks! Happy Holidays, here's your joy. (She waves her arm and
spreads her joy.)"
63,Phoebe, Thank you! And Happy Holidays.
65,Phoebe," Wait, you can't take the money out."
67,Phoebe," But, can't you leave the dollar? This money is for the poor."
69,Phoebe," Okay, Seasons Greetings and everything, but still…"
71,Phoebe," Oh, I'm going to give him something else besides joy, just… (She
scowls at him.)"
73,Joey, That part was perfect for me! I can't believe I didn't get it!
74,Ross," I'm sorry, man. Hey, y'know what you should do? You should make something
happen for yourself. Y'know, like-like write a play. Write a movie! Huh? I mean, what
about those Good Will Hunting guys?"
75,Joey," Come on Ross be realistic, y'know? If I did write something, what are the
chances I could get those guys to star in it?"
77,Joey," Wait a second, I could star in it!"
78,Ross, Or that.
79,Joey," I can't write! Y'know I mean I-I-I'm an actor, I don't have the discipline
that takes, y'know? I can't do it."
80,Ross," I'll help you. Yeah, I'll make up a schedule and make sure you stick to
it. And plus, it'll give me something to do."
81,Joey, Really? You'd-you'd do that for me?!
82,Ross, Yeah!
83,Joey, Thanks!
84,Ross," (grabbing a notepad and sitting down) All right, we'll start off slow. The
only thing you have to do tonight is come up with the name of your main character."
85,Joey, Done!
86,Ross, And it can't be Joey.
87,Joey, It's not.
88,Ross, Or Joseph.
89,Joey, (disappointed) Oh.
91,Monica," Hey, what's up?"
92,Rachel," I just saw Danny getting on the subway with a girl and he had his arm
around her."
93,Monica," Oh, honey, I'm sorry."
94,Rachel," Well, you should be, this is all your fault! You meddled in our
relationship!!"
95,Monica, You had no relationship!!
96,Rachel," No, but I was doing my thing and everything was going according to the
plan!"
97,Monica," Oh God, stop with the plan! So what, so what you saw him with a girl?
Who cares?! That doesn't mean anything! Now look, you're going to go out on a date with
Danny and you're going to be so charming he's gonna forget all about that stupid subway
girl."
98,Rachel," She was kinda stupid. You're right. All right, I'm just gonna go on the
date. I'm gonna go on the date. That is the new plan."
100,Monica," Come on, hurry!"
103,Joey," Hey, how do you spell suspicious? "
104,Chandler, Why?
105,Joey, Because I think this character is going to be suspicious about stuff.
107,Chandler," Yes! Chandler Bing, 7! Chandler Bing, 0."
108,Joey, You're driving me crazy with that!
109,Chandler," Okay, I'll stop."
110,Joey, Don’t stop! Move the bowl further away! Ross could make that shot!
112,Joey," Well, you suck! But at least you suck at a man's game now."
113,Chandler, You wanna play?
114,Joey," Chandler, I can't be playing games, Ross is gonna be home soon. And I have
to write five whole pages if I'm gonna stick to his schedule."
115,Chandler," Well, so, play for the next 30 minutes and then write until he gets
home."
116,Joey," (jumping up) All right! But uh, listen, what do you say we crank it up a
notch?"
117,Chandler, I'm intrigued. 
118,Joey," All right, all we need is a little lighter fluid. "
119,Chandler," Okay, but be careful okay, because I wanna get our security deposit
back."
120,Joey," Yeah, I think we said good-bye to that when we invented hammer darts."
121,Chandler, Do you even remember which part of the wall is not spackle?
122,Joey," Uh yeah, right here. (He punches his fist through the wall next to the
door.)"
124,Phoebe," Thank you, Happy Holidays."
126,Phoebe," Now, that's trash. Young lady, you can't… (The lady ignores her and
walks off.) Hey! Stop that young lady, she donated trash!"
128,Phoebe," Hey!! (The bucket starts smoking.) The charity's on fire! Help! (Yet
another guy walks by carrying a cup, which Phoebe grabs.) Oh good! Thank you, I need that.
(She throws onto the smoldering fire. Suddenly the bucket erupts in flames.) Whoa! What is
that?! (She sniffs the cup.) (To the guy.) It's nine o'clock in the morning!"
130,Ross," All right. (Reading.) A room. A man enters, he looks suspicious. (Stops
reading a flips the page to find the next one is blank.) That's it? (Joey shrugs.) Joey,
you're supposed to have five pages done by now! Including an exciting incident!
(Flipping through the rest of the pad.) And what is, and what is all this?! (Reading.) The
official rulebook of Fireball."
131,Joey," Yeah, that's the uh, game we were playing."
132,Chandler," (entering from his room carrying a fire extinguisher and wearing oven
mitts) Oh yeah, it's great! See you take a tennis ball, a bowl, and some lighter
fluid—Op! Op! (He puts out a small fire which has re-ignited in his room.)"
133,Ross," This is helping your career?! Huh? I thought you wanted to be an actor not
the creator of crazy lawsuit game!"
134,Joey," You're right, you're right, I'll get back to work."
135,Ross," (To Chandler) And shame on you! You should know better, Joey needs to
work. (To Joey) Now come on! "
136,Joey, Hey!
138,Ross," No! Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah! You can have this back when the five pages are done!
(After Joey walks past, Ross throws the ball down in pain.) Ahh! (Chandler shows him the
burn spots on his oven mitts.)"
141,Rachel, So did I. I'm really glad Monica asked us out.
144,Rachel," You're sister? You're sister's asleep on the couch? (Danny nods,
""Yes."") Ohhh! I saw her with you on the subway and now she's asleep on
the couch!"
147,Rachel, Hi!
159,Rachel," (not sure what to do) Uh, it was very nice meeting you. (They continue
to ignore her.)"
162,Phoebe," Nobody! Nobody respects the bucket! You wouldn't believe what people put
in here! Look! (Hands it to Monica.) Okay, does this look like a garbage can to you?"
163,Monica, No.
164,Phoebe, Does it look like an ashtray?
165,Monica, No.
166,Phoebe, Does it look like a urinal?
167,Monica, Eww!! (Throws the bucket down.)
168,Ross," So Pheebs, are you gonna go back out there or what?"
169,Phoebe," Well, yeah! But I'm not gonna take anymore crap. Okay? No more Mrs. Nice
Bucket!"
170,Monica," Yeah, good for you. Y'know you're tough, you lived on the streets."
171,Phoebe," Yeah, I'm gonna go back to being Street Phoebe. Yeah! Oh but, y'know
what? I can't go totally back because Street Phoebe really wouldn't be friends with you
guys. Sorry. (Leaves.)"
172,Rachel, (entering from her room) Hey!
173,Monica, Hey!
174,Rachel," Hey, umm, can I ask you guys something?"
176,Rachel," Uh, I don't have any brothers so I don't know, but uh, did you guys
wrestle?"
177,Ross," Oh-oh, yeah."
178,Monica," All the time. In fact, I was undefeated."
179,Ross," Uh, you weighted 200 pounds."
180,Monica," Still, I was quick as a cat."
181,Rachel," Well, I met Danny's sister yesterday, and uh that was actually the girl
on the subway."
182,Monica," Oh, you're kidding."
183,Rachel," Yeah, they were very y'know…wrestley. But, I guess that's normal?"
184,Monica," (laughing with Ross) We don't, we don't wrestle now."
185,Ross," Yeah, not since I got too strong for you."
186,Monica, Too strong for me?
187,Ross, Yeah.
188,Monica," You wanna go right now? 'Cause I'll take you right now, buddy! You wanna
go?"
189,Ross, Oh fine.
190,Monica," Ready? (They grab a hold of each other's necks.) Wrestle! (They start
wrestling.)"
191,Rachel," Okay, y'know what uh, actually, that's great. That helps a lot. Thanks.
(She leaves them to wrestle.)"
193,Chandler," (entering from his bedroom) Guys, come on! Let's go! The puck drops in
20 minutes! Come on, Joe!"
194,Ross, Joey's not going.
195,Joey, (To Chandler) I didn't finish my five pages.
196,Chandler," Well, why can't you do them tomorrow?"
197,Ross, Because tomorrow he's redoing yesterday's pages.
198,Joey, Yesterday's pages did not reflect my best work.
199,Chandler," (To Ross) Why don't you cut him a little slack? Okay? Maybe if he
relaxes a little bit, he'll get some work done."
200,Ross," I think he's been relaxing enough, thanks to you and Fireball."
201,Joey," Dude, if you think Fireball's relaxing, you've obviously have never
played."
202,Chandler," The only reason you're doing this to Joey is because you're bored.
Okay, it's not his fault that you're unemployed."
203,Ross, I am not unemployed. I'm on sabbatical!
204,Joey," Come on look guys, don't fight."
205,Ross," And the reason I'm doing this is because I am Joey's friend. And if
you were a good friend, you'd be doing the same thing."
206,Chandler," Oh, so being a good friend means acting like a total jerk?"
207,Ross, If it does? Then you're an amazing friend of mine.
208,Joey," Hey-hey guys, hey! How about we settle this over a friendly game of
Fireball? Huh? I'll go unhook the smoke detectors!"
209,Ross," How about we settle this right now! (He rips up the tickets.) There! Now,
no one's going to the game. Ha-ha-ha!"
210,Chandler, I paid for those tickets!
211,Ross," No you didn't. You said you would, but you never did!"
212,Chandler, Oh yeah! (Makes an unintelligible taunting sound.)
215,Joey," Oh, y'know the same thing happened to me one time."
216,Chandler, When did that happen to you?!
217,Joey," Don't you remember when we were jogging in the park and we saw that really
pretty bird and wanted to take a picture—I didn't have my camera!"
218,Chandler," Oh yeah. First off all, chasing the Churo guy isn't jogging."
224,Rachel," Oh, great!"
225,Chandler," Okay, bye! (To the gang.) Oh my God!!"
226,Monica, That was unbelievable! 
227,Rachel," Okay, see? I told you!"
228,Joey," Yeah, wow, sorry Rach."
229,Chandler, I don't believe they're brother and sister.
230,Joey, They're brother and sister!!!
232,Phoebe," Oh whoa-whoa-whoa! Wait a minute, open up your hand; let me take a look.
(The lady opens up her hand.) Quarter. Dime. Lint? Not interested in that. (She throws the
lint away.) What's this? A Canadian coin? Get outta here! (The lady walks away.)"
234,Phoebe," Whoa-whoa-whoa! No drinks near the bucket! Set it down over there and
then you can make a contribution! (The guy starts to walk away with a hurt look on his
face.) And you can leave the hurt bunny look over there too! (Her boss and a co-worker
walk up.) Hi Bob! (The same old lady from before walks bye.) (To the old lady.) I thought
I told you to get outta here!"
236,Phoebe, What?!
238,Phoebe, That chick can't handle my corner.
240,Phoebe," Fine. (She hands her bell to Ginger and starts to take down her signs.)
(The same old lady walks by again.) All right, I'll give you one pointer. Look out for
that bitch. (The old lady.)"
243,Rachel," Yeah uh, y'know what uh, let's skip it."
245,Rachel," Umm, you-you and your sister seem to have umm, a very special bond,
and…"
247,Rachel," Well, okay, look. I don't know, listen, I don't know what's going on
here but let's…"
249,Rachel," No, I have two sisters. But one of them has a very masculine energy."
251,Rachel," No-no, they're not very nice people."
253,Rachel," Well, uh, I-I don't know. See when-when you put it that way y'know it
does sort of…"
256,Rachel," Yeah, okay, I'll see you later. (Gets up and runs from the apartment.)"
258,Chandler," Oh hey! There's some kids playing in the street, you wanna go down
there and give them a project, ruin their day?"
259,Ross," Hey, if they have a ball maybe you can stick razor blades in it and teach
them a new game, Gonna Need Stitches Ball."
260,Joey," (entering) Hey guys! I was at the library all morning and I already
finished my five pages for today!"
261,Ross, Yay!
262,Chandler," Great! Now, we can go to the Ranger game! (Pause) Last night!"
263,Joey," No dude, Ross tore up the tickets!"
264,Ross," I guess when you don't have so many distractions, it's easier for you to
focus. Huh?"
265,Chandler," Yeah or also when you don't have somebody breathing down your neck ALL
THE LIVE LONG DAY!!"
266,Joey," Yeah, well, that's fine, but the important thing is that I finished it.
And uh, I think it's really good, but y'know it'd really help me is if I could hear it. So
would you guys read it for me?"
267,Chandler, All right. (Takes a copy.)
268,Ross, All right. (Takes another copy.)
269,Joey," Okay. (Reading.) ""It's a typical New York City apartment. Two guys
are hanging out."" Ross (Points to him.)"
271,Ross, Hey man.
272,Chandler, What is up?
273,Ross," About yesterday, I was really wrong. I am sorry."
274,Chandler," No, it was me. I'm sorry. I over reacted."
275,Ross," Maybe it was both of us, but we had our best friend's interest…
(Pauses and looks at Joey.) But we had our best friend's interest at heart."
276,Chandler, Could I be more sorry. (Looks at Joey.)
277,Ross," I don't know, I'm one sorry polentologist. (Stops reading.) All right
Joey, we get it. (To Chandler) I'm sorry."
278,Chandler, (To Ross) I'm sorry too.
279,Joey," Oh no! No-no, keep reading! The good part's coming up. Keep going."
280,Ross," (reading from the script.) I am sorry, Chandler."
281,Chandler," I am sorry, Ross."
282,Joey," A handsome man enters. (Playing the part of the handsome man.) Hey! How's
it going guys? I don't know what you two were talking about, but I'd like to say thanks to
both of you. You, (Ross) you wouldn't let me give up on myself, and you (Chandler) well
you co-created Fireball. The end."
283,Chandler, This took you all day?!
284,Joey," No-no, this only took five minutes. I spent the rest of the day coming up
with new, Ultimate Fireball. (Takes out a bowling ball and a propane torch.) Ha-ha!"
287,Joey," (Reading the scene set up.) Okay, it's a typical New York City apartment.
Two girls are just hanging out."
289,Monica," Hi, how are you doing Kelly?"
290,Rachel," I'm doing just fine! God, Tiffany, you smell so great!"
291,Monica," It's my new perfume. Why don't you come closer where you can really
appreciate it?"
293,Rachel," Oh, y'know Joey, you are sick!"
294,Monica, This is disgusting!
296,Rachel, I'm not reading this!
297,Joey, What?! Wait-wait-wait! The handsome man was about to enter!!
1,Joey, All right! Here we go! 1999! The year of Joey!
2,Chandler," (deadpan, standing next to Monica) We're very happy for you."
3,Joey, What's the matter?!
4,Chandler," We wanted to kiss at midnight, but nobody else is going to so
y'know…"
5,Joey," All right, I'll take care of it."
6,Monica," Oh no, wait! Joey!"
8,Ross, (hopping) 73! 72! 71!
9,Joey," Ross! Ross! Ross, listen! Who are you kissing at midnight, huh? Rachel or
Phoebe?"
10,Ross, What?
11,Joey," Well you gotta kiss someone, you can't kiss your sister."
12,Ross," Well, who's gonna kiss my sister."
13,Joey, Chandler.
14,Ross," Awww, man! Really?"
15,Joey," Dude-dude, who would you rather have kiss your sister, me or Chandler?"
16,Ross, That's a good point.
17,Joey, Yeah.
18,Ross," Oh well, since I have that whole history with Rachel, I guess Phoebe."
19,Joey," Okay, great!"
20,Ross, All right.
21,Joey, Pheebs! Pheebs! Ross wants to kiss you at midnight!
22,Phoebe," It's so obvious, why doesn't he just ask?"
23,Joey," Rach! Rach! Listen, I'm gonna kiss you at midnight."
24,Rachel, What?!
25,Ross," Well, everyone's gotta kiss someone. You can't kiss Ross you got the
history."
26,Rachel, So?
27,Joey," So? Who would you rather have kiss you, me or Chandler?"
28,Rachel," Oh, good point."
29,Joey, Yeah!
32,Chandler, (To Monica) Happy New Year!
33,Monica, Happy New Year.
34,Ross," (To Phoebe) Happy New Year, Pheebs!"
35,Phoebe, You too!
36,Rachel," (To Joey) Happy New Year, Joey!"
37,Joey, So did that do anything for ya?
41,Ross, Y'know what? I'm gonna go out on a limb and say no divorces in '99!
42,Rachel, But your divorce isn't even final yet.
43,Ross," Just the one divorce in '99! Y'know what, I am gonna be happy this year. I
am gonna make myself happy."
44,Chandler," Do you want us to leave the room, or?"
45,Ross," Everyday I am gonna do one thing that I haven't done before. That
my friends is my New Year's resolution."
46,Phoebe, Ooh! That's a good one! Mine is to pilot a commercial jet.
47,Chandler," That's good one too, Pheebs. Now all you have to do is find a
planeload of people who's resolution is to plummet to their deaths."
48,Phoebe," Maybe your resolution is to not make fun of your friends, especially the
ones who may soon be flying you to Europe for free on their own plane."
49,Monica," She has a better chance of sprouting wings and flying up your nose than
you do of not making fun of us."
50,Ross," In fact, I'll bet you 50 bucks that you can't go the whole year without
making fun of us. Eh, y'know what, better yet? A week."
51,Chandler," I'll take that bet my friend. And you know what, paying me the 50
bucks could be the ""new thing you do that day!"" (Ross looks at him.) And it
starts right now!"
52,Joey," All right, my New Year's resolution is to learn how to play the guitar."
53,Ross, Ohh.
54,Phoebe, Really?! How come?
55,Joey," Well, y'know those special skills I have listed on my resume? I would love
it would be great if one of those was true."
56,Phoebe, Do you want me to teach you? I'm a great teacher.
57,Joey, Really? Who-who have you taught?
58,Phoebe," Well, I taught me and I love me."
59,Joey, Yeah that'd be great! Thanks Pheebs!
60,Rachel," Op, look! Claire forgot her glasses! And she's gonna be really needing
these to keep an eye on that boyfriend, who, I hear, needs to keep his stapler in his desk
drawer, if you know what I'm talking about."
61,Monica," Hey Rach, maybe your resolution should be to umm, gossip less."
62,Rachel, I don't gossip!
64,Rachel," Well, maybe sometimes I find out things or I hear something and I pass
that information on y'know kinda like a public service, it doesn't mean I'm a gossip. I
mean, would you call Ted Kopel a gossip?"
65,Monica," Well if Ted Kopel talked about his coworkers botched boob jobs, I would."
66,Rachel, What? They were like this! 
70,Ross, Okay! (She leaves.) (To Chandler and Joey.) Hey!
72,Ross, I just asked that girl out.
73,Chandler, Nice!
74,Joey," Nice!! Yeah! Is that part of your resolution, your new thing for today?"
75,Ross," Yes it is. See. (Shows them the piece of paper she gave him with her name
and phone number on it.)"
76,Chandler, (reading it) Elizabeth Hornswoggle?
77,Ross," That's right, uh, Elizabeth Hornswoggle."
78,Chandler, Horn-swoggle.
79,Joey, You all right Chandler? Is there something funny about that name?
80,Chandler," No. No, I just think that maybe I-I'd heard it somewhere before. (Sits
down rubbing his temple.)"
81,Joey," Oh really! Where? Somewhere funny I'd bet! (Chandler is straining to keep
quiet as Phoebe enters.)"
82,Ross," Hi, Pheebs!"
83,Phoebe, Hey! 
84,Ross," Oh-oh, guess what? I-I have a date with Elizabeth (Talking into Chandler's
ear.) Hornswoggle."
85,Phoebe," Hornswoggle? (To Chandler) Ooh, this must be killing you."
86,Ross," All right, see you later."
87,Joey," See ya! All right Pheebs, I am ready for my first lesson. "
88,Phoebe," Okay. (Joey tries to take the guitar.) Oh no-no-no, you don't touch the
guitar! First you learn here, (Points to her head.) then you learn here. (Points to the
guitar.)"
89,Joey," Umm, okay."
90,Phoebe," Okay, lesson one chords. Now, I don't know the actual names of the
chords but umm, I-I-I made up names for the way my hand looks while I'm doing them. (She
starts to show Joey the chords. Transcribers Note For this one you'll have to use your
imagination, 'cause it would take me 50 pages to describe each one. So if you want to see
them, you'll have to wait for this episode to come to a TV near you.) (Holding up her hand
and then reconfiguring her hand with each name.) So then, this is Bear Claw. Okay, umm,
Turkey Leg and Old Lady. (Joey tries to imitate them.)"
91,Chandler," What an interesting approach to guitar instruction. Y'know some might
find it amusing, I myself find it regular."
93,Phoebe," Hey everybody, Rachel was so good today. She didn't gossip at all."
94,Rachel," I didn’t! Even when I found out…umm, all right, well let's
just say I found something out something about someone and let's just say she's gonna keep
it. (Goes into her room.)"
95,Joey," Hey, Pheebs! Check-check this out. (Holds up his hand in one of Phoebe's
chords.)"
96,Phoebe," Ooh, you nailed the Old Lady! (They both laugh at what she said.)"
97,Joey," Yeah listen so, I thought I was getting better, so on my way home today I
stopped by this guitar store and…"
98,Phoebe," Did you, did you touch any of the guitars while you were there?
Did you?!"
99,Joey, No.
100,Phoebe," Give me your hands. (He does and she smells his left hand.) Strings.
Gimme it! (He gives her his right hand and she smells it as well.) Pick. Do you want to
learn to play guitar?"
101,Joey, Yes!
102,Phoebe, Then don't touch one!!
103,Ross," (entering, with Ben) Hi!"
105,Monica, Hi Ben!
107,Chandler," (notices something) Ross is wearing leather pants! Does nobody else
see that Ross is wearing leather pants? (Pause, no one speaks.) Someone comment on the
pants!"
108,Rachel, I think they're very nice.
109,Monica, I like 'em.
110,Joey, Yeah! (Chandler bangs the table in frustration.)
111,Monica, I like them a lot.
112,Chandler," That's not what I had in mind! See, people like Ross don't generally
wear these types of pants. You see, they're very tight. (Motions to Ross's buttock.) Maybe
there's something in that area."
114,Ross," Oh see, I-I needed a new thing for today and there's this leather store
that always smells so good and I thought to myself, ""Wow, (To Chandler) I never
really owned a good smelling pair of pants before."""
116,Chandler, Oh come on!! (Storms out.)
117,Ross," (after he's left) Okay, seriously, what do you think?"
118,Joey, You look like a freak.
119,Rachel," Awful, absolutely awful. (Plus other negative comments from Phoebe and
Monica.)"
121,Ross," What are you, what are you doing?"
122,Monica, It's my New Year's resolution!
123,Ross," What, to blind my child?"
124,Monica," No! To take more pictures of all of us together. I mean I really think
it's the best resolution because everyone will enjoy the pictures."
125,Joey," Well, everyone will enjoy my music as well. (Does a chord and Monica
starts taking pictures of him and Phoebe. They both start to strike a pose with the
excessive amount of pictures that Monica takes.)"
127,Ross," (talking to himself) My God! These pants are burning up! (He's still
wearing the leather pants.) (She snuggles closer.) Oh come on, she wants to snuggle now!
What is she trying to kill me? It's like a volcano in here! (Out loud.) Are you hot? "
129,Ross," Okay, it must just be me then."
131,Ross," That was just the pants on the couch. Umm, hey, do you, do you mind if I
use your bathroom?"
133,Ross," Thanks. (Gets up and as he does so, the sound returns. Without another
word he heads into her bathroom.)"
135,Ross, (in ecstasy) Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh……….
137,Ross, 'Kay!
139,Ross, Oh my God!
141,Phoebe," Tiger! (Joey moves his hand in an attempt to do the chord, in fact he
does it with each name.) Dragon! Iceberg!! (He fails.) Joseph, did you even study at all
last night?"
142,Joey," Yes! Yes, I did."
143,Phoebe, Then do Iceberg!
144,Joey, (thinks) (quietly) G-sharp.
145,Phoebe," G-sharp? Have you been studying the real names of the chords?
(Joey doesn't answer.) Have you? (He looks away in shame.) Oh my God! "
146,Joey, What?! I didn't touch a guitar!
147,Phoebe," No, but you're questioning my method!"
148,Joey," No, I'm not questioning it, I'm saying it's stupid! (Notices Monica
standing between them and smiling.) What?! (The camera clicks, taking another picture.)"
149,Monica, Thank you. (Leaves.)
150,Phoebe, Y'know none of my other student thought I was stupid.
151,Joey," Your other student, was you!"
152,Phoebe," Yeah, well, y'know maybe you just need to try a little harder!"
153,Joey," (looking in the Yellow Pages) Look, maybe I need to try a real teacher!
Right here! Here! Andy Cooper, he teaches guitar and look ooh, there's a nice picture of
him with a little kid and THE KID'S GOT A GUITAR!!!!!! (Storms out.)"
154,Phoebe," Fine! You go learn from your qualified instructor! But don't come crying
to me when everyone's sick and tired of hearing you play Bad, Bad Leroy Brown!!"
155,Rachel," (entering, singing) ""Baddest man in the whole damn town."""
156,Phoebe," Oh, fine! Take his side! (Storms out.)"
158,Monica," (on phone) I can't wait to be with you! I'll sneak over as soon as Ross
picks up Ben. I'll just tell Rachel I'm gonna be doing laundry for a couple of hours."
159,Chandler," (on phone) Laundry. Huh. Is that my new nickname? (Rachel is
absolutely stunned, she opens her mouth in absolute amazement.)"
160,Monica," (on phone) Awww, y'know what your nickname is, Mr. Big…"
161,Rachel," Arghh!! (She quickly hangs up the phone and starts to pace around
wondering what to do.)"
164,Joey, (answering phone) Hello?
165,Ross," (calling from Elizabeth's bathroom) Joey, it's Ross! I need some help!"
166,Joey," Uhh, Chandler's not here."
167,Ross," Well, you can help me!"
168,Joey, Okay.
169,Ross," Listen, I'm in Elizabeth's bathroom…"
170,Joey, Nice!
171,Ross," No, I-I got really hot in my leather pants so I took them off but they
must have shrunk from the-the sweat or-or-or my legs expanded from the heat. Look, I-I
can't put them back on. I can't!"
172,Joey," Oh. That is quite a situation. Uh, do you see any like, powder?"
173,Ross," Powder! Yeah! Yeah, I have powder! (Grabs some of her shelf.) "
174,Joey," Good-good, okay, sprinkle some of that on your legs, it'll absorb some of
the moisture and then you can get your pants back up."
175,Ross," Yeah, okay, hold on! (He puts the phone down and proceeds to spread a
large amount of powder on his legs and makes another attempt at pulling up his pants. It
doesn't work, and without picking up the phone leans down to it.) (Almost in tears.)
They're not coming on man."
176,Joey," Umm, do you see any—oh, Vaseline? "
177,Ross," Ohh, I-I see lotion, I have lotion! Will that work?"
178,Joey," Yeah, sure, spread some of that on there."
179,Ross, Hold on.
181,Joey, Ross? You okay?
182,Ross," They're still, they're still not coming on man and the lotion and the
powder have made a paste!"
183,Joey," Really?! Uhh, what color is it?"
184,Ross, What difference does that make?!
185,Joey," Well, I'm just—if the paste matches the pants, you can make yourself
a pair of paste pants and she won't know the difference!"
186,Rachel," (entering) Joey, do you have a minute?"
187,Ross," Dude, what am I gonna…"
188,Joey," (To Ross) Uh, Rachel's here, so good luck man, let me know how it works
out. (He hangs up the phone and strands Ross in the bathroom.)"
189,Rachel," Oh, Joey, I have such a problem!"
190,Joey," Oh well, you're timing couldn't be better. I am putting out fires all over
the place."
191,Rachel," Okay. Okay. Okay. Joey, I have got to tell you something!"
192,Joey," What-what is it, what is it?"
193,Rachel," Oh my God, it's so huge, but you just have to promise me that you cannot
tell anyone."
194,Joey," Oh no, no-no-no-no! I don't want to know!"
195,Rachel," Yes! Yes! Yes, you do want to know! This is unbelievable!"
196,Joey," I don't care, Rach! Look, I am tired of being the guy who knows all the
secrets but can't tell anyone!"
197,Rachel, What? What secrets? You know secrets? What are they?
198,Joey, And you're not supposed to be gossiping!! 
199,Rachel," I know, I know! I just can't keep this one in, so I pick up the
phone… (Joey in a childish attempt to not hear what Rachel is about to say, puts his
fingers in his ears and starts to scream loudly. Rachel turns and walks out upon seeing
that Joey's not gonna listen, and as she exits Chandler walks in and sees Joey in his
current state.)"
200,Joey, I'm not listening to you!
204,Ross," All right, I'm coming out. Hey, can you turn the lights off."
208,Ross, I had a problem.
210,Joey," Hey, Pheebs?"
211,Phoebe," No, I can't talk to you! I don't have a fancy ad in the Yellow Pages!"
212,Joey," Look, Pheebs, I just, I wanna apologize for, for saying that your method
was stupid and-and maybe ask you to be my teacher again. And-and I promise, I won't touch
a guitar until you say I'm ready. (After a short pause she hands him her guitar.) You
really think I'm ready?"
213,Phoebe, Uh-huh!
214,Joey," Wow! Cool! (He takes the guitar, stands up, and goes to play a note.
However, while strumming it, he knocks it out of his hands and it bounces off the table
and lands on the floor. Phoebe just stares at the guitar.)"
215,Joey, (sitting back down) Was the chord at least right…
216,Phoebe, No!
218,Chandler, Oh my God!
219,Monica," We heard about your pants, I'm so sorry."
220,Ross," This year was supposed to be great! But, it's only the second day and I'm
a loser with stupid leather pants that don't even fit!"
222,Ross, Look at me! (Chandler squeaks in an attempt not to make fun of him.)
223,Monica," Hey, hey, look. Look Ross, Ben drew a picture of you! (Shows him Ben's
picture.) Huh? You're-you're a cowboy!"
224,Ross," Oh, be-because of the leather pants."
225,Monica," See? Ben doesn't think you're a loser, he thinks you're a cowboy! Now
that's something."
227,Phoebe, Yeah!
228,Rachel, That really is something; that's really cool.
229,Joey, Howdy partner!
230,Ross," Maybe I should get another pair! Ooh, y'know, they-they had some with
fringe all down the sides. (Chandler starts rubbing his temple again.) I'm gonna go kiss
Ben goodnight. (He starts to head for Monica's bedroom.) I can't believe he thinks I'm a
cowboy. (Pause.) I would make a good cowboy. (He struts into Monica's room.)"
231,Monica," Okay, now that everything's wrapped up here, I think I'm, I'm gonna go
do my laundry."
232,Chandler," Oh yeah, me too. Y'know if this shirt is dirty. (Smells it.) Yep."
234,Phoebe," Okay, I'm gonna go too. I'm gonna go to the airport. I figure if I hang
around there long enough, someone's bound to leave one of those planes unattended."
235,Rachel," Good luck, honey!"
236,Phoebe," Bye! (She exits, leaving Rachel and Joey alone.)"
237,Rachel," Hey, uh, Joey?"
238,Joey, Umm?
239,Rachel, Remember that big thing I was gonna tell you about?
240,Joey," Oh, no! (Starts that screaming thing again. Rachel stops him by pulling
his fingers out of his ears.)"
241,Rachel," I'm not gonna tell you, but if you found out on your own, that would be
okay and then we could talk about it. Right?"
242,Joey," Well, then it wouldn't be a secret. So yeah, that would be okay. Yeah.
Yeah!"
243,Rachel," (quietly) Yeah. Well. (Pause.) Hey uh Joe, would mind going over to
Chandler's bedroom and get that book back that he borrowed from me?"
244,Joey, Now? You want me to go over there now?
245,Rachel, Yeah!
246,Joey, Do you know something?
247,Rachel, Do you know something?
248,Joey, I might know something.
249,Rachel, I might know something too.
250,Joey, What's the thing you know?
251,Rachel," Oh no, I can't tell you until you tell me what you know."
252,Joey, I can't tell you what I know.
253,Rachel, Well then I can't tell you what I know.
254,Joey," Okay, fine."
256,Joey, You don't know!
257,Rachel," All right, how about I go over there and I will walk into
Chandler's bedroom and I will see that thing that I think that I know is actually
the thing that I think that I know! (Note Kudos to Ms. Aniston on the delivery of that
line. She said it very quickly and didn't screw up a word. Try it yourself, it ain't that
easy.)"
258,Joey, (gasps) YOU KNOW!!!!
259,Rachel, AND YOU KNOW!!!
260,Joey," Yeah, I know!!!!"
261,Rachel," Chandler and Monica?!! Oh, this is unbelievable!! How long have you
known?"
262,Joey," Too long! Oh my God, Rach, I've been dying to talk to someone about this
for so long! Listen, listen, we can't say anything about this to anybody, they're so weird
about that! Listen… (Phoebe returns and interrupts them.)"
264,Phoebe, Hey! It's raining. I don't want to fly in the rain. So…
266,Joey," Oh, I am going to go for a walk in the rain."
267,Rachel," Ohhh, yeah, me too."
269,Phoebe, That's weird. (Pause.) I bet they're doing it.
272,Chandler," (entering) Oh good, okay, I can't take it anymore. I can't take it
anymore. So you win, okay? Here! (Hands him the 50 bucks he's about to owe him.) Pheebs?
Flying a jet? Better make it a spaceship so that you can get back to your home
planet! And Ross, phone call for you today, Tom Jones, he wants his pants back! And
Hornswoggle? What are you dating a character from Fraggile Rock?! (He sits down and
sighs in relief.)"
0,Rachel, Come on Joey!!!
1,Joey," Rach, I told you everything I knew last night! Look, it's not that big of a deal,
so Monica and Chandler are doing it."
2,Rachel, I can't believe you would say that!
3,Joey, Sorry. Monica and Chandler are making love.
4,Rachel," No! I mean come on! This is a huge deal! (She sits next to him on the
couch.) Fine I want—I need more details, who-who initiated the first kiss?"
5,Joey, (thinks) I don't know.
6,Rachel, Is he romantic with her?
7,Joey, I don't know.
8,Rachel, Are they in love?
9,Joey, (thinks) I don't know.
10,Rachel, You don't know anything.
11,Joey," Ohh, I know one thing!"
12,Rachel, What?
13,Joey, They did it right there on the couch. 
17,Joey, Hey Ross!
18,Phoebe, Hey!
19,Ross," (disinterested) Hey-yeah. (He hurries up to the counter.) Hey Gunther, can I have
a scone please? (To the gang.) Wanna hear some good news? Someone I know is getting
married! Yeah! And weddings are happy occasions! Oh, by-the-by it's my ex-wife Emily!"
21,Chandler, Sorry man.
23,Ross," Oh, thanks Gunther. (He takes it, hands the plate it's on to Rachel, sets it down
on the table, and proceeds to pound it into oblivion while saying.) STUPID BRITISH SNACK
FOOD!!!!!!!"
24,Chandler, Did they teach you that in your anger management class?
25,Phoebe," Hey, you know what might help you deal with it? Think of it this way, you and
Emily are in the past and you can't be mad about the past. So are you still mad about the
Louisiana Purchase?"
26,Rachel," Pheebs, I don’t think anyone's mad about that."
27,Phoebe, Exactly! Because it's in the past!
28,Joey, (eyeing the flattened scone) Anybody gonna eat that?
30,Monica," Look at us all dressed up for the big office party! By the way, what are we
celebrating?"
31,Chandler," Oh, we had a lot of liquor left over from the Christmas party."
32,Monica," I think this is so cool because none of our friends are here and we can be a
real couple. We don't have to hide."
33,Chandler," I know, I can do this. (He takes her hand.)"
34,Monica," Ooh, and I can do this. (She kisses him on the cheek.)"
39,Chandler," I asked myself that very question, sir. Uh, (Points to Monica) this is
Monica. (Points to his boss.) This is my boss, Doug. Doug this is Monica."
40,Monica," Hi, nice to meet you!"
44,Chandler," No, sir."
48,Monica, What was that?
49,Chandler, What?
50,Monica, That noise you just made?
51,Chandler," Oh, that was my work laugh."
52,Monica, Really? Your work laugh?
53,Chandler," Oh, believe me, to survive this party, you're gonna have to come up with one
too."
54,Monica," All right, check me out."
55,Chandler, Okay.
60,Chandler, Hey! Everybody at work loved you last night! 
61,Monica, Really?
62,Chandler," And! They like me more just because I was with ya! I think you
repaired a lot of the damage from when they met Joey. And Doug wants us to play tennis
with them. He's never even talked to me outside of work. Except for that time when
we bumped into each other at that strip club. (She glares at him.) Strip church. Anyway,
I'm gonna go try and find a racquet."
63,Monica," Hey, I thought you already had one."
64,Chandler," Oh I used too, but then Joey thought it would be fun to go to Central Park
and hit rocks at…bigger rocks. (He starts to leave and stops an entering Rachel.) Hey
Rach, do you have a tennis racquet?"
65,Rachel," Oh umm, y'know I lent it to Joey and I never actually got it back."
66,Chandler," Okay, good luck with that. (Exits.)"
67,Rachel, (To Monica) Hey!
68,Monica, Hi!
69,Rachel, What's up?!
70,Monica, What are you doing here? I thought you had to do inventory all day.
71,Rachel," Well yeah, I do, but I decided to take a long lunch and spend some time with my
friend Monica. Y'know I-I feel that we don't talk anymore. How are you? What is new with
you?"
72,Monica," Uhh, not much. Uh, work's good."
73,Rachel," Oh y'know what, we don’t have to talk about work. We can talk about
anything!"
74,Monica, Okay. Umm…
75,Rachel, Hey! Y'know what? Let's talk about relationships!
76,Monica," Okay, what's going on with you?"
77,Rachel, Nothing! You go!
78,Monica," Well, I-I—there was this guy at the bank that I thought was cute umm, but
I don't anymore."
79,Rachel," Wow that's uh, juicy. Umm, (checks watch) y'know what though Mon, I actually do
have a lot of work to do so if-if—are you sure there's just not anything else?"
80,Monica," Yes, I'm sure! Rachel is there something that you want to talk me about?"
81,Rachel, No! (Gets up to leave.) (Under her breath.) If there was I wouldn't tell you.
84,Phoebe," Okay, then what happened?"
86,Phoebe, (gasps) Ohh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. (The chick clucks.) You'll get your turn!
87,Ross," (entering from the bathroom) Hey Pheebs, what's going on?"
88,Phoebe," Nothing! (Picks up and sets the chick down on the floor.) (To the chick.) This
is not over!"
89,Ross, No! No! No!
90,Phoebe, What?!
91,Ross," I was up all night writing this really nasty letter to Emily! It was perfect and
now it's all covered in-in… (The duck quacks.) Actually, thanks!"
92,Joey, (entering from his room) All right! Everybody ready to go to the movies?
93,Ross," Uh actually, I think I'm gonna skip it."
94,Joey, Really?
95,Ross," Yeah, I'm gonna stay and read my book. I just wanna be alone right now."
96,Joey," Oh. Are you sure you don't want to come? Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan, they get mail and
stuff."
97,Ross," That's okay, Joe."
98,Joey," All right, let's go Pheebs."
99,Ross, (licks the envelope and encounters a foreign substance on the glue.) Oh God!
104,Monica, Game!
109,Monica," Am I on fire today or what?! Those birds are browned, basted, and ready to be
carved!"
110,Chandler," Okay, easy Martina. I think we should let them win the next game."
111,Monica," I'm sorry, I don't understand what you just said."
112,Chandler, Let them win one.
113,Monica," Are you crazy?! We own those two! I mean look at 'um, he can't breath and she's
popping pills."
114,Chandler, You're not even giving them a chance!
115,Monica, They have racquets don't they?!
117,Chandler," Oh yes, sir! Put me out of my misery. Are you sure you never played pro?
(Does his work laugh.) (To Monica) Please let them win!"
118,Monica, I'll take it down to 95% but that's the best I can do.
120,Chandler," Oopsey, missed it!"
121,Monica," I got it! (She hits a forehand smash that bounces right in between Doug and
Kara and scores a point.)"
124,Monica, I got it!!
126,Chandler, Long! (Gives Monica the Work Laugh.)
128,Monica, I can't believe you let them win!
129,Chandler," Yeah, at least you hid your feelings well about it. (Removes a smashed
racquet from his bag.)"
130,Monica, I was frustrated.
131,Chandler, It was my racquet.
132,Monica, I was frustrated with you!
133,Chandler," If we hadn't lost the game they never would've invented us to dinner tomorrow
night."
134,Monica," Y'know what really bothers me? Is—it's how-how different you act around
them! I mean y'know the throwing the tennis games, the fake laugh, the ""I'll see you
around, Bing!"" ""Not if I see you first, Doug!"" (Mocks the fake laugh.) I
gotta tell you, I don't like Work Chandler. Okay? The guy's a suck-up."
135,Chandler," Okay y'know what, because you said that, I'm not putting out tonight."
137,Monica," I'm telling you, something's wrong! My brother does not stay out all night."
138,Joey, Maybe we should check the trash chute.
139,Rachel, Ross couldn't fit down the trash chute.
140,Joey," That's right, he almost could. Which is exactly how I got stuck there."
142,Phoebe, Hey!
143,Rachel, There he is!
144,Monica," Oh my God! (She goes to hug him, stops short, and hits him on the shoulder.)
Where the hell have you been?!!"
145,Ross," Just, y'know out."
146,Rachel," Ohh, out, oh God, I don't know why we didn't think to check there!"
147,Phoebe, What were you doing?
148,Ross," I uh, went to a bar. And then I just uh, just walked around for a while."
149,Rachel, You walked around all night in the city by yourself?
150,Joey, (snaps his fingers) He hooked up! He hooked up with someone.
151,Ross," Look, I don't have to answer your questions! Okay? I'm a big boy, I can do
whatever I want!"
152,Joey, He hooked up!! Tell us about her!
159,Rachel, Yeah! No that's what I was thinking.
161,Phoebe," Oh, nobody's judging you. (They all turn and look at Ross.)"
164,Ross," Okay, look, I-I know what you guys are going to say…"
165,Phoebe, You two will have very hairy children.
166,Ross," Okay, I didn't know you would say that."
167,Rachel, Ross! Janice?!
168,Joey," All right, hold on! Hold on. Hold on. This is Ross, okay? He's our friend. He
obviously went crazy. He obviously lost his mind."
169,Ross," Look, I didn't lose my mind! Okay, Janice and I have a lot in common!
We've-we've both been divorced. We-we both have kids."
170,Phoebe, So are you actually gonna see her again?
171,Joey, Phoebe! Don't put ideas in his head!
172,Ross, I am gonna see her again.
173,Joey, Damnit Phoebe!!
175,Rachel," (entering) Okay, I have to tell you something that I have never admitted during
our entire friendship! But, when we were in high school I made out with James Farrell even
when I knew that you liked him! Wow, that feels so good to get off my chest! Okay, you go!"
176,Monica, My turn? What-what are you talking about?
177,Rachel," Ugh, Monica, I know about you and Chandler."
178,Monica, What?!
179,Rachel," I overheard you guys on the phone the other day, and you said, ""I'll just
tell Rachel that I'm doing laundry for a couple of hours."" And he said,
""Laundry? Is that my new nickname?"" And you said, ""No! You know what
your nickname is, Mr. Big."""
180,Monica," Well. Sounds like you're writing yourself a little play there Rach. Wow! Let me
know how that one turns out."
181,Rachel," Well, I wouldn't know because I got so freaked out that I hung up the phone."
182,Monica," Well, if you had kept listening, you-you would have heard me call him Mr.
Big…(Thinks)…ot."
183,Rachel, What?!
184,Monica, Mr. Bigot. He tells the most racist jokes.
185,Rachel," All right. So you're telling me that there is nothing going on between you and
Chandler."
186,Monica, Me and Chandler?! (Does her fake laugh.)
188,Joey," All right, put your 20 bucks down. First one to find the tasty treat wins. Okay?"
189,Phoebe, Uh-hmm.
190,Joey," All right. Let's get the contestants out of their isolation booths. (He removes
the waste bucket that's over the duck and the laundry basket that's over the chicken.) And
they're off! (He puts his foot in front of the chick, stopping it from moving.)"
191,Phoebe, Get your foot off my contestant! Judge!
192,Joey," Judge rules, no violation."
193,Phoebe, Ohhh.
194,Ross, (entering) Hey guys!
195,Phoebe, Hey!
196,Joey, Yeah!
198,Ross," Y'know what? It sounds so weird to say this but, I just had a great day with
Janice! "
200,Joey, What?!
201,Phoebe, Are you serious?!
202,Ross," Yeah! I opened up to her about all the terrible stuff that's been happening to
me. I mean I talked for hours. (Joey has lost interest and is watching the race again.) It
is amazing to have someone give you such-such focused attention."
203,Phoebe," You don't need Janice for that, you've got us. We…"
204,Joey, And the duck gets the Nutter-Butter!
205,Phoebe," (turning from Ross.) No!! Hey-hey that's not a Nutter-Butter, that's just an
old Wonton!"
206,Joey," Judge rules, Nutter-Butter."
207,Phoebe," Ohh, tough call."
208,Joey, Yeah.
212,Monica," Oh, none for me. Thanks."
213,Chandler, Just a little bit of sugar.
216,Monica, (To Chandler) How does that laugh not give you a headache?
217,Chandler," Oh, you get used to it."
218,Monica," Y'know, I-I-I don't think that I can. So if you don't mind, maybe this will be
it for me on the work things."
219,Chandler," So I laugh at my boss's jokes, what's the big deal?"
220,Monica," I'd rather hang out with a sniveling work weasel guy when I can be hanging out
with my boyfriend who I actually respect."
221,Chandler, Oh. (Does a double take when he realizes what she just said.)
223,Chandler, What?
225,Chandler," Well, I-I just didn't think it was funny sir."
227,Chandler," Well, I just…"
228,Monica," (interrupting) Honey, I just don't think that you understood the joke."
229,Chandler, Really?
230,Monica," Yeah! I mean it was really funny, I-I just don't think you got it. You see
Kara's coffee is-is-is weak tasting, okay? But-but what Doug was-was imply that it was
weak physically. You get it now honey?"
231,Chandler," I think I do! (They all laugh.) Thank you, Monica."
232,Monica, I thought you could use the help.
233,Chandler, Coffee in a fight! (Does the laugh again.)
235,Joey," (entering) Hey Rach! Hey, you mind if I read my comic books in here?"
236,Rachel, Sure! Why?
237,Joey," Oh well, Chandler and Monica are over there and it's kinda hard to concentrate."
238,Rachel," What?! She just called and said that she was gonna be working late! She keeps
lying to me! That's it! Y'know what? I'm just gonna go over there and confront them right
now!"
240,Chandler," (from his bedroom) All right, so you're telling me that I have to tell racist
jokes now?!"
241,Monica," Sorry! I'm just—I'm not very good at this! I'm a terrible liar and I hate
having to lie to Rachel!"
242,Chandler, But we're not ready to tell yet!
243,Monica," I know! It's just that…ever since high school Rachel was the one person I
told everything too. Y'know? I miss that so much now. She's my best friend."
245,Monica," (entering) Joey?! Oh my God, Rachel!"
246,Rachel, Hey! Hi!
247,Monica," Wh-wh-what are you doing here? (She tries to pull her shirt down to cover the
fact that she's wearing men's boxers.]"
248,Rachel," Well, I was actually—I-I came over here to-to borrow this lamp. To umm,
look at my books, y'know, see them a little better."
249,Monica, Okay great! 
250,Rachel, Yeah!
251,Monica," Great! Umm, well what-what I was doing in Chandler's room is that umm, I was
cleaning it! In fact, he pays me to clean it!"
252,Rachel, Oh! What a great way to earn some extra pocket money.
253,Monica," Y'know when I said to you earlier that I was at work umm, I'm at my new work."
254,Rachel," That's good enough. Right? (Pause.) Okay, well umm, I'm gonna go look at my
books!"
255,Monica, Okay.
256,Rachel, Okay.
257,Monica, I'll get back to my new job.
259,Rachel," 'Kay. (Pause.) Congratulations on your new job. (She goes and hugs Monica and
is almost in tears.)"
261,Chandler," Man, she is really gullible."
265,Ross, Thanks!
267,Ross," Are you sure? Because I can stay out as late as you want. I told you how I'm on
sabbatical from work, right?"
269,Ross, Oh…
271,Ross," This isn't what I ordered! Man! Can anything go right in my life?! First my
marriage falls apart and then…"
273,Ross, Okay. Sometimes I feel…
275,Ross, Huh?
277,Ross," Let-let me make sure I'm hearing this right, you're ending this with me because I'm
too whiney? (Janice makes an agreeing sound.) So you're saying, I've become so whiney that
I annoy you, Janice."
279,Ross, OH…MY…GOD!!
281,Ross, I am now.
284,Joey," Umm, hi."
289,Ross," Dude, we got to talk."
290,Chandler, Okay.
291,Ross," I just wanted to tell you something before you heard it from someone else and I
hope this isn't too weird, but uh, I had uh, a thing with Janice. (He laughs, his real
laugh this time.) What you're-you're not mad?"
292,Chandler, Why would I be mad?
293,Ross," Well, because y'know there are certain rules about this kind of stuff. You don't
uh, you don't fool around with your uh, friend's ex-girlfriends or possible girlfriends or
girls they're related to."
294,Chandler," (realizes what Ross just said and the implications to him) I am mad! But you
know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna forgive you! Because that's what friends do! They
forgive their friends when they do everything you just said, all on the list there. Well,
but I want you to remember that I forgave you."
295,Ross, Okay.
296,Chandler, I also want you to remember that I let you live here rent free!
297,Ross, All right.
298,Chandler," And, I want you to remember that I gave you twenty (counts his money) seven
dollars. No strings attached. Now, if you can't remember that, I think we should write it
down—let's write it down!"
0,Monica," I can't believe we've never done this before! It's sooo good! So
good for Monica! "
2,Chandler," Oh! Look at that, time's up! My turn!"
3,Monica, That was a half an hour?
4,Chandler, It's your timer.
6,Monica," Y'know, I don't like to brag about it, but I give the best
massages!"
7,Chandler," All right, then massage me up right nice!"
9,Chandler, Ah! Ahh!! Ahh!!
10,Monica," It's so good, isn't it?"
11,Chandler, It's so good I don't know what I've done to deserve it!
12,Monica, Say good-bye to sore muscles!
13,Chandler, Good-bye muscles!!
16,Chandler," I'm telling you, she gives the worst massages ever!! Okay, it was like
she was torturing me for information. And I wanted to give it up I just—I didn't know
what it was!"
17,Joey," Chandler, if it really hurts that bad you should just tell her."
18,Chandler," Look, for the first time in my life I'm in a real relationship. Okay,
I'm not gonna screw that up by y'know, telling the truth."
19,Ross, (walking up with Rachel and carrying coffee) Hey.
20,Joey," Whoa, dude, look out! You almost crushed my hat! (He picks a hat up from
the floor. It's one of those magician stovepipe hats.)"
21,Ross, Sorry.
22,Chandler," (examining the hat) And the bunny got away. (Turns and starts looking
for the bunny as Joey puts the hat on.)"
23,Ross, (glaring at Joey) This would be the place where you explain the hat.
24,Joey," Oh! Yeah, look there's this play all right? And I'm up for the part of
this real cool like suave international guy. A real clothes horse. So I figure that
everyone at the audition is gonna be wearing this kinda y'know, ultra-hip, high fashion
stuff."
25,Chandler, And you're gonna make them all disappear.
26,Joey," Yeah, like you could find something as sophisticated as this."
28,Chandler, Done.
29,Rachel," Joey, if you wanna look good, why don't you just come down to the store?
I'll help you out."
30,Joey," Great! Thanks, Rach!"
31,Rachel," Sure! (Pause) God, please take those off!"
32,Joey, All right. 
34,Ross," Hey Pheebs, how's it going?"
35,Chandler, Hey.
36,Phoebe," Hey! Umm, well, only okay because I just got back from, from the
hospital."
38,Rachel, What?
39,Ross, Is everything okay?
40,Joey, Are you all right?
41,Phoebe," Oh yeah, no-no-no. I'm fine. I'm okay, but umm, my Grandma sorta died."
42,Joey, Pheebs! Sorry!
43,Phoebe," It's okay, I mean she had a really incredible life. And it's not like
I'm never gonna see her again, y'know she's gonna visit."
44,Rachel," Well maybe, maybe she's with us right now?"
45,Phoebe," Yeah, her first day on a new spiritual plane and she's gonna come to the
coffeehouse!"
46,Monica," (entering, in a hurry) Guys! Guys! I just saw two people having sex in a
car right outside."
47,Ross," Uhh, Pheebs' Grandmother just died."
48,Monica," Ohh my God, I'm so sorry."
49,Phoebe," It's okay. Actually y'know what, it's kinda cool. 'Cause it's like
y'know, one life ends and another begins."
50,Monica," (to the guys) Not the way they're doing it. What, what happened? How did
she die?"
51,Phoebe," Well umm, okay we were in the market and she bent down to get some
yogurt and she just never came back up again."
52,Joey," Pheebs, I'm so sorry."
53,Phoebe," It was really sweet. The last thing she said to me was; ""Okay dear,
you go get the eggs and I'm gonna get the yogurt and we'll meet at the checkout
counter."" And y'know what? We will meet at the checkout counter."
55,Rachel," Okay now Joey, y'know that since you're returning all of this stuff
right after the audition you're gonna have to wear underwear?"
56,Joey," All right, then you'd better show me some of that too then."
57,Rachel," Okay, it's missing something. Ooh, I know! Umm, okay. (Goes and grabs a
bag, that looks like a purse, and shows it to Joey.)"
58,Joey, Really? A purse?
59,Rachel, It's not a purse! It's a shoulder bag.
60,Joey, It looks like a women's purse.
61,Rachel," No Joey, look. Trust me, all the men are wearing them in the spring
catalog. Look. (Shows him.) See look, men, carrying the bag."
62,Joey," See look, women, carrying the bag. (He puts it on his shoulder and
looks at himself in the mirror and likes what he sees.) But it is odd how a women's purse
looks good on me, a man."
63,Rachel, Exactly! Unisex!
64,Joey, Maybe you need sex. I had sex a couple days ago.
65,Rachel, No! No Joey! U-N-I-sex.
66,Joey," Well, I ain't gonna say no to that."
69,Phoebe, It's Phoebe.
71,Phoebe," Umm, well I sorta have some bad news, can I come in?"
73,Phoebe," Umm, well, umm Grandma died."
75,Phoebe," No, she just died today! Okay, umm, we're having a memorial service
tomorrow."
77,Phoebe, No you didn't!
79,Phoebe," Well, lots of people! Look, are you coming to memorial service or not?"
81,Phoebe," Fine. Okay, enjoy your concert. (Starts to leave.)"
84,Joey, Hey!
85,Chandler, Hey!
87,Chandler, Wow! You look just like your son Mrs. Tribbiani!
88,Joey," What? Are you referring to my man's bag? At first, I thought it just
looked good, but it's practical too. Check it out! It's got compartments for all your
stuff! Your wallet! Your keys! Your address book!"
89,Ross, Your make-up!
90,Rachel," (entering) Joey, what are you doing with the bag? You're audition is not
until tomorrow."
91,Joey," Yeah, but sandwich time is right now. (Removes a sandwich and starts
eating.)"
92,Rachel," Joey, y'know you get any mustard on that bag, you can't return it."
93,Joey, Why would I return it? I love this bag!
94,Rachel," All right, then you owe me $350."
95,Joey," Fine! Do you take Vasa or Mustercard? (He's holding the fake credit cards
that come with the bag.)"
96,Rachel, (glaring at him) Joey…
97,Joey," All right relax, look I'll pay you with the money from the acting job I am
definitely gonna get thanks to you."
98,Ross," What's the part, Anti-man?"
99,Rachel," Hey, don't listen to them. I think it's sexy."
100,Joey, U-N-I-sexy? (Smiles provocatively.) 
102,Phoebe," Well hello, Mrs. Penella! Thank you so much for coming! Well, okay look,
here's your umm, 3-D glasses and Reverend Pong will tell you when to put them on."
104,Rachel, Hi sweetie!
105,Ross," Hey, how are you holding up?"
106,Joey," Hey Pheebs, I'm so sorry."
107,Phoebe," (notices his bag.) Hey, y'know what? My Grandma had the exact same bag!"
108,Joey," Here, I brought you some flowers. (He pulls them out of the bag.)"
109,Phoebe, Thanks!
110,Chandler, Pulling flowers out it makes the bag look a lot more masculine.
114,Phoebe," Yeah, welcome."
116,Phoebe, Umm here's your 3-D glasses.
118,Phoebe, So how did you know Francis?
120,Phoebe, Really?! What's your name?
124,Phoebe, You're Frank Buffay?
126,Phoebe, You just said…
128,Phoebe, But…
130,Phoebe, Oh my God!
131,Monica, What?! What honey?
132,Ross, What happened?
133,Phoebe, That was my dad!
134,Chandler, Oh my God!
136,Joey," (approaches, wearing his glasses) Hey you guys, check it out. Check it
out. (Moves his hand towards and away from his face.) It's like it's coming right at me.
(Chandler helps out a little bit by pushing on Joey's arm, which causes his hand to slap
him in his face.)"
139,Monica," Oh, did you catch him?!"
140,Phoebe, Uh-huh.
141,Ross, Wh-what did he say?!
142,Phoebe," He said, ""Nice to meet you Glenda."" (They stare at her,
dumbfounded) Well, obviously I couldn't give him my real name?"
143,Rachel, Why?! Why not?!
144,Phoebe," Come on, you saw the way he ran out of here! What do you think? He's
gonna stick around and talk to the daughter he abandoned!"
145,Joey, What did you say to him?
146,Phoebe," Well, I said, I told him y'know, that I was the executor person of
Francis' will and that I needed to talk to him so I'm gonna meet him at the coffee house
later."
148,Phoebe," All right, well, I just can't think about that right now. I just wanna
say good-bye to my Grandma."
149,Rachel, Okay.
150,Monica," All right, let's go say good-bye."
153,Joey," (entering, with bag) Hey! I'm off to my audition. How do I look?"
154,Rachel," Ahhh, I think you look great! That bag is gonna get you that
part."
155,Chandler, And a date with a man!
156,Joey," Y'know what? Make fun all you want. This is a great bag! Okay? And
it's as handy as it is becoming. Now, just because you don't understand something, doesn't
make it wrong. All right? So from now on you guys are gonna have to get used to the fact
that Joey, (pats the bag) comes with a bag! (Exits.)"
157,Phoebe," All right, I'd better go too. I have to go talk to my dad."
158,Rachel," Ooh, Pheebs, what are you gonna say? Are you gonna tell him who you are?"
159,Phoebe," Umm, no, not at first 'cause I-I don't want to freak him out"
160,Ross," Well, but aren't you pissed at him?! I mean this guy abandoned you!
I gotta tell you if this were me, this guy would be in some serious physical danger!
(Getting worked up) I mean I-I-I'd walk in there and I'd be like, ""Yo, dad! You and
me outside right now!"" (Calming down.) I kinda scared myself."
161,Monica," Well, at least you scared someone."
162,Phoebe," Y'know it's funny, you'd think I'd be angry. I mean, you'd think
I'd wanna rip his tiny little head off. Fortunately, I'm past it."
163,Monica," Phoebe, you do seem a little tense. Here, let me help you. "
164,Phoebe, All right.
166,Phoebe," Oh! Get off!! Ow!! Oh, stop it!! Why?! Why are you doing that to me?!"
167,Monica, What are you talking about?
168,Phoebe," As a masseuse and a human, I'm begging you, never do that to anyone!"
169,Monica," (indignant) I give good massages! (Ross laughs.) I used to give them to
Rachel all the time before she got allergic! And-and-and Chandler loves them! Watch! (She
starts giving Chandler a massage.)"
170,Phoebe," (seeing the look on Chandler's face) He-he does not like it! He hates
it! He's in pain!"
171,Monica, No he's not!
172,Chandler," (wincing) Yes, he is!"
173,Monica, What?!
174,Chandler," I'm sorry but, ow-owww-owww!"
175,Monica, You've been lying to me? I can't believe you'd do that.
176,Ross," Well, maybe he just didn't want to hurt your feelings."
177,Monica," But the minute we start to lie to each other… (Pauses after she
realizes what she's saying.) And by 'we' I mean society."
180,Joey," (reading from the script) Well, you must be new here. Why don't we get a
table and I'll buy you a drink."
182,Joey," Yeah, sure. (He takes it off and starts reading.) Well, you must be new
here. Maybe we should—I'm sorry, can I ask you something? (He stops and asks a
question.)"
184,Joey," Well, first it's not a purse."
186,Joey," I mean if-if you're thinking it's a woman's bag, it's not. It's a man's
bag!"
188,Joey," All right look, let me show you the catalog! (Does so.) See? Huh? It's the
latest thing! Everyone's got one! Men! Women! Children! Everyone's carrying them!"
190,Joey," Noooo. No-no-no, these babies sell themselves."
192,Joey, Yeah but I didn’t read anything.
194,Joey," Okay! All right, I'll see ya. (As he's walking off stage.) (Patting the
bag.) We got it! We got it!"
196,Chandler," Hey, is Rachel here?"
197,Monica, No.
198,Chandler," (coming all the way in) Listen, I just wanted to apologize about this
afternoon and the whole massage thing. Y'know? I-I really like 'em."
199,Monica," Oh, please, stop! Look, we're supposed to be honest with each other. I-I
just wish you could tell me—just say, ""I don't like your massages."""
200,Chandler, (falling into that trap) I don't like your massages.
201,Monica, (starting to cry) See? It's no big deal.
202,Chandler," Okay, but now see you're crying!"
203,Monica," I'm not crying about that! I'm crying about something that happened at
work."
204,Chandler, What?
205,Monica, (bursting into tears) My boyfriend said he didn't like my massages.
206,Chandler," It's okay, you don't have to be the best at everything."
207,Monica, Oh my God! You don't know me at all!
208,Chandler," Okay, you give the worst massages in the world."
209,Monica, I'm crying here!!
210,Chandler," Okay, hear me out. Okay? You give the best bad massages. If
anybody was looking for the best bad massage and they were thinking to themselves,
""Who's the best of that?"" They'd have to go to you."
211,Monica," Huh. So you're saying like umm, if there was an award for the best bad
massage, well who would get that?"
212,Chandler," Oh, it would be you! You! Monica! And you'd get all the votes!"
213,Monica," So maybe they could umm, call the award the Monica?"
214,Chandler, Absolutely!
215,Monica, Okay. I suck!
216,Chandler, Yeah! (They hug.)
218,Phoebe," Umm, thank you for meeting with me."
220,Phoebe," Come, sit. (He's hesitant.) Sit. (Still hesitating.) Sit! (He sits on
the arm of the couch.) Umm, all righty, before we get started I just—I need you to
state for the official record that you are in fact Frank Buffay."
222,Phoebe, Okay.
224,Phoebe, Huh?
226,Phoebe," Oh yes. Yes. Yeah—no. She did. She left you umm, (looking in her
purse) this lipstick."
228,Phoebe," Okay. I have just a few questions to ask so I'm going to get out my
official forms. (She picks up a couple of crumpled receipts.) Okay, so, question 1) You
and uh, you were married to Francis' daughter Lilly, is that correct?"
230,Phoebe," Okay, umm, question 2) Umm, did that marriage end A. Happily, B. Medium,
or C. In the total abandonment of her and her two children?"
232,Phoebe, Yeah. See? (Quickly shows him.)
234,Phoebe," Hmm, okay, total abandonment. Okay, reasons for abandonment, A.
Top secret government work, B. Amnesia, or C. Or you're just a selfish, irresponsible bad,
bad man?"
236,Phoebe, What?!
238,Phoebe, But you-you-you came to see Lilly?
240,Phoebe, Lilly's dead. (He looks up in shock.)
242,Phoebe, She's dead.
244,Phoebe," Well, if she isn't then cremating her was a big mistake."
246,Phoebe, 17 years ago.
248,Phoebe," Well, Ursula is a waitress and-and she lives in Soho. And Phoebe,
(pause) is on this couch."
250,Phoebe," Yep, lipstick and a daughter, big day for you!"
252,Phoebe," Yes. Well, that's neither here nor there."
254,Phoebe," Y'know what, it doesn’t matter what you say it's not gonna make a
difference anyway, so you can just go."
256,Phoebe, That's a defense?
258,Phoebe, You make up songs?
264,Phoebe," Well, I am. (Moves over and takes his hand.)"
266,Phoebe," Not yet, no. (Drops his hand and moves back.)"
269,Joey, (dejected) Hi.
271,Chandler," Hey man, how did the audition go?"
272,Joey, Estelle said I didn't get it. (Sits down next to Rachel on the couch.)
273,Rachel, What?! Why? Joey you were so ready for it!
274,Joey," Yeah, I thought so too but, she said the casting people had some problems
with me."
275,Ross, What kind of problem?
276,Joey," Well to tell you the truth, they uh, (Pause) they had a problem with the
bag!"
277,Chandler, Oh my God!
278,Ross, Nooooo!
279,Joey, Y'know what? It was a stupid play anyway!
280,Monica," Y'know, Joey, I think it's time to give up the bag."
281,Joey," I don't wanna give up the bag. I don't have to give up the bag! Do I Rach?
(She's avoiding his eyes.) Oh, you think I should give up the bag!"
282,Rachel," Honey wait, Joey, I’m sorry I mean as terrific as I think you are
with it… (Looks for help.)"
283,Chandler," Oh, hey! (Ross nods in agreement as well.)"
284,Rachel, …I just don't know if the world is ready for you and your bag.
285,Joey, I can't believe I'm hearing this!
286,Rachel," Wait a minute! Wait a minute! I'm not saying that you shouldn’t
have a bag, I just—it's just there are other bags that are a little less umm, (Pause)
controversial."
287,Chandler," Yeah umm, they're called wallets."
0,Phoebe," (looking out the window) Oh hey, you guys, look! Ugly Naked Guy is
putting stuff in boxes!"
2,Rachel, I'd say from the looks of it; our naked buddy is moving.
3,Ross," Ironically, most of the boxes seem to be labeled clothes."
4,Rachel," Ohh, I'm gonna miss that big old squishy butt."
5,Chandler, And we're done with the chicken fried rice.
6,Ross," Hey! Hey! If he's moving, maybe I should try to get his place!"
8,Ross, It would be so cool to live across from you guys!
9,Joey," Hey, yeah! Then we could do that telephone thing! Y'know, you have a can,
we have a can and it's connected by a string!"
10,Chandler, Or we can do the actual telephone thing.
13,Ross," Oh my God! I love this apartment! Isn't it perfect?! I can't believe I
never realized how great it is!"
14,Rachel, Well that is because your eye immediately goes to the big naked man.
15,Phoebe," It's amazing! You better hurry up and fill out an application or I'm
gonna beat you to it."
16,Ross," (laughing) Ohh. (Phoebe takes a couple of steps to the door and Ross
quickly hurries out.)"
17,Rachel," Well, I never thought I'd say this, but I'm gonna go use Ugly Naked
Guy's bathroom. (Does so.)"
18,Phoebe," (looking out the window) Oh, look! There's Monica and Chandler! (Starts
yelling.) Hey! Hey, you guys! Hey! (Chandler and Monica start taking each other's clothes
off.) Ohh!! Ohh! Ahh-ahhh!!"
19,Rachel, What?!
20,Phoebe, (screaming) Ahhh!! Chandler and Monica!! Chandler and Monica!!
21,Rachel, Oh my God!
22,Phoebe, CHANDLER AND MONICA!!!!
23,Rachel, OH MY GOD!!!
24,Phoebe, OH!! MY EYES!!! MY EYES!!!!
25,Rachel, Phoebe!! Phoebe!! It's okay!! It's okay!!
26,Phoebe, NO! THEY'RE DOING IT!!!
27,Rachel, I KNOW!! I KNOW!! I KNOW!
28,Phoebe, YOU KNOW?!!!
29,Rachel," Yes, I know! And Joey knows! But Ross doesn't know so you have to stop
screaming!!"
30,Ross, (entering) What's going on?
32,Rachel," (trying to divert his attention from the window by jumping up and down)
HI!! Hi! "
33,Ross, What?! What?!
34,Rachel," Nothing! Oh God, we're just so excited that you want to get this
apartment!"
35,Ross," Actually, it looks really good. (Turns towards the window and now Phoebe
starts jumping to divert his attention.)"
36,Phoebe," (Screaming incoherently.) Get in here!!! (Motions to join her and
Rachel.)"
39,Phoebe," You mean whenever Monica and Chandler where like y'know doing laundry or
going grocery shopping or—Oh! All that time Monica spent on the phone with sad Linda
from camp!"
40,Rachel," Uh-huh, doing it. Doing it. Phone doing it."
41,Phoebe," Oh! Oh, I can't believe it! I mean I think it's great! For him. She
might be able to do better."
42,Joey, (entering) Hey guys!
43,Rachel, Joey! Come here! Come here!
44,Joey, What? What?
45,Rachel, Phoebe just found out about Monica and Chandler.
46,Joey, You mean how they're friends and nothing more? (Glares at Rachel.)
47,Rachel," No. Joey, she knows! We were at Ugly Naked Guy's apartment and we
saw them doing it through the window. (Joey gasps) Actually, we saw them doing it up against
the window."
48,Phoebe," Okay, so now they know that you know and they don't know that Rachel
knows?"
49,Joey," Yes, but y'know what? It doesn't matter who knows what. Now, enough of us
know that we can just tell them that we know! Then all the lying and the secrets would
finally be over!"
50,Phoebe," Or, we could not tell them we know and have a little fun of our
own."
51,Rachel, Wh-what do you mean?
52,Phoebe," Well y'know every time that they say that like they're doing laundry
we'll just give them a bunch of laundry to do."
53,Rachel," Ohhh, I-I would enjoy that!"
54,Joey," No-no-no! No-no wait Rach, you know what would even be more fun? Telling
them."
55,Rachel," Ehhh, no, I wanna do Phoebe's thing."
56,Joey, I can't take any…
57,Phoebe, No! You don't have to do anything! Just don't tell them that we know!
58,Joey," Noo! I can't take any more secrets! (To Rachel) I've got your secrets.
I've got their secrets. I got secrets of my own y'know!"
59,Rachel, You don't have any secrets!
60,Joey," Oh yeah? Well, you don't know about Hugsy, my bedtime penguin pal. (Joey
shies away.)"
61,Rachel," (To Phoebe) So umm, how-how are we gonna mess with them?"
62,Joey, Ugh.
63,Phoebe," Well, you could use your position y'know as the roommate."
64,Rachel, Okay.
65,Phoebe," And then. I would use y'know the strongest tool at my disposal. My
sexuality."
66,Chandler, (entering) Hello children!
68,Phoebe," Okay, watch, learn, and don't eat my cookie."
70,Chandler, Hey.
71,Phoebe," Hey! Ooh, wow that jacket looks great on you!"
72,Chandler, Really?
73,Phoebe," (feels his arm) Yeah the material feels so soft—hello Mr. Bicep!
Have you been working out?"
74,Chandler," Well, I try to y'know, squeeze things. (Phoebe giggles
uncontrollably.) Are you okay?"
75,Phoebe," Well, if you really wanna know, I'm—Oh! I can't tell you this."
76,Chandler," Phoebe, it's me. You can tell me anything."
77,Phoebe," Well actually you're the one person I can't tell this too. And the one
person I want to the most."
78,Chandler, What's going on?
79,Phoebe," I think it's just y'know that I haven't been with a guy in so long and
how sometimes you're looking for something and you just don’t even see that it's
right there in front of you sipping coffee—Oh no, have I said to much? Well it's just
something to think about. I know I will."
82,Monica, You are so cute! How did you get to be so cute?
83,Chandler," Well, my Grandfather was Swedish and my Grandmother was actually a
tiny little bunny."
84,Monica," Okay, now you're even cuter!!"
85,Chandler, Y'know that is a popular opinion today I must say.
86,Monica, What?
87,Chandler," The weirdest thing happened at the coffee house, I think, I think
Phoebe was hitting on me."
88,Monica, What are you talking about?
89,Chandler, I'm telling you I think Phoebe thinks I'm foxy.
90,Monica, That's not possible!
91,Chandler, Ow!
92,Monica," I'm sorry it's just, Phoebe just always thought you were, you were
charming in a, in a sexless kind of way."
93,Chandler," Oh, y'know I-I can't hear that enough."
94,Monica," I'm sorry, I think that you just misunderstood her."
95,Chandler," No, I didn't misunderstand, okay? She was all over me! She touched my
bicep for crying out loud!"
96,Monica, This bicep?
97,Chandler, Well it's not flexed right now!
99,Rachel," Hey Mon, what are you doing now? Wanna come see a movie with us?"
100,Monica," Uhh, y'know actually I was gonna do some laundry."
101,Rachel, Oh.
102,Monica," Hey Chandler, wanna do it with me?"
103,Chandler," Sure, I'll do it with ya."
104,Monica, Okay.
105,Rachel," Okay great, hold on a sec! (She runs to her room and returns carrying a
huge bag of laundry.) Oh, here you go! You don't mind do ya? That would really help me out
a lot! Thanks!"
106,Monica, I mean I-I don't I think I have enough quarters.
107,Phoebe, I have quarters! (She holds up a bag of quarters.)
108,Ross, (entering) Hey!
109,Rachel, Hey Ross! Any word on the apartment yet?
110,Ross," Well, I called over there and it turns out Ugly Naked Guy is subletting it
himself and he's already had like a hundred applicants."
111,Rachel, Oh.
112,Ross," No-no, I got the edge. I know it's not exactly ethical but I sent him a
little bribe to "
114,Monica," Oh, is it that pinball machine with the big bow on it?"
115,Ross, No.
116,Chandler, That new mountain bike?
117,Ross, No.
118,Monica, Well what did you send?
119,Ross, A basket of mini-muffins.
120,Phoebe," But there's a whole table of mini-muffin baskets. Which one did you
send?"
121,Ross, The small one.
122,Rachel," What?! You-you actually thought that basket was gonna get you the
apartment?"
123,Ross," Well yeah! Someone sent us a basket at work once and people went crazy
over those little muffins. It was the best day."
124,Chandler, Your work makes me sad.
125,Ross," Oh man! I want that place so much!! I was so sure that was gonna work!
There's twelve bucks I'll never see again! (Exits.)"
126,Rachel," All right honey, we'd better go if we wanna catch that movie."
127,Monica, Bye!
129,Phoebe," Bye Chandler! (She walks up to him.) (Quietly.) I miss you already. (She
pinches his butt.)"
130,Chandler," (after they've left) Okay, did you see that?! With the inappropriate
and the pinching!!"
131,Monica," Actually, I did!"
132,Chandler," Okay, so now do you believe that she's attracted to me?"
133,Monica," Ohhh, oh my God! Oh my God! She knows about us!"
134,Chandler, Are you serious?
135,Monica," Phoebe knows and she's just trying to freak us out! That's the only
explanation for it!"
136,Chandler," (a little hurt) Okay but what about y'know my pinchable butt and my
bulging biceps—She knows!"
139,Chandler, (entering) Joey!
141,Joey, Yeah?
142,Chandler, Phoebe knows about us!
143,Joey, Well I didn't tell them!
144,Monica, Them?! Who's them?
145,Joey," Uhhh, Phoebe and Joey."
146,Monica, Joey!
147,Joey, And Rachel. I would've told you but they made me promise not to tell!
148,Chandler, Oh man!
149,Joey," I'm sorry! But hey, it's over now, right? Because you can tell them that
you know they know and I can go back to knowing absolutely nothing!"
150,Monica, Unless…
151,Joey, No! Not unless! Look this must end now!
152,Monica," Oh man, they think they are so slick messing with us! But see
they don't know that we know that they know! So…"
153,Chandler," Ahh yes, the messers become the messies!"
155,Ross, Noooo.
156,Rachel," Oh Ross, honey you gotta stop torturing yourself!"
157,Phoebe," Yeah, why don't you just find another apartment?"
158,Ross," Look I've already looked at like a thousand apartments this month and none
of them even compares to that one!"
159,Rachel, Y'know what you should do?
160,Ross, Huh?
161,Rachel," You should find out what his hobbies are and then use that to bond with
him. Yeah! Like if I would strike up a conversation about say umm, sandwiches. Or uh, or
my underwear."
162,Joey, I'm listening.
163,Rachel, (To Ross) See?
164,Ross," That is a great idea! And! I know Ugly Naked Guy because we've been
watching him for like five years so that gives me back my edge! Oh, let's see now
he had the trampoline."
165,Phoebe, He broke that.
166,Ross," Well, he had gravity boots."
167,Rachel," Yeah, he broke those too."
168,Joey, So he likes to break stuff.
169,Ross," Okay, I've got to go pick up Ben but I-I will figure something out. (He
opens the door and stops.) Hey, didn't he used to have a cat?"
170,Phoebe," I wouldn't bring that up, it would probably just bum him out."
171,Joey," Yeah, poor cat, never saw that big butt coming."
172,Ross, Right. (Exits.)
174,Rachel," Hello! (Listens) Oh yeah! Hey! Hold on a second she's right here! (To
Phoebe) It's Chandler."
175,Phoebe, (in a sexy voice) Oh? (Takes the phone from Rachel.) Hello you.
176,Chandler," Hello Phoebe, I've been thinking about you all day. (He's holding the
phone so that Monica can hear it as well.)"
177,Phoebe, Eh?
178,Chandler," Well you know that thing you said before, I'd be lying if I said I
wasn't intrigued."
179,Phoebe, Really?
180,Chandler," Yeah, listen, Joey isn't gonna be here tonight so why don't you come
over and I'll let you uh, feel my bicep. Or maybe more."
181,Phoebe," I'll have to get back to you on that. Okay, bye! (Hangs up.) Oh my God!
He wants me to come over and feel his bicep and more!"
182,Rachel, Are you kidding?!
183,Phoebe, No!
184,Rachel," I can not believe he would do that to Mon—Whoa! (She stops suddenly
and slowly turns to point at Joey. Joey is avoiding her eyes.) Joey, do they know that we
know?"
185,Joey, No.
186,Rachel, Joey!
187,Joey, They know you know.
188,Rachel," Ugh, I knew it! Oh I cannot believe those two!"
189,Phoebe," God, they thought they can mess with us! They're trying to mess with
us?! They don't know that we know they know we know! (Joey just shakes his head.) Joey,
you can't say anything!"
190,Joey, I couldn't even if I wanted too.
192,Ross," Good evening, sir. My name is Ross Geller. I'm one of the people who
applied for the apartment. And I-I realize that the competition is fierce but—I'm
sorry. I, I can't help but notice you're naked and (He claps his hands.) I applaud you.
Man, I wish I was naked. I mean, this-this looks so great. That is how God intended it."
194,Monica," (in the kitchen with Chandler) Look at them, they're-they're panicked!"
195,Chandler," Oh yeah, they're totally gonna back down!"
196,Monica, Oh yeah!
198,Phoebe," All right. All right! If he wants a date? He's gonna get a date. All
right, I'm gonna go in."
199,Rachel, All right. Be sexy.
200,Phoebe, (laughs) Please.
202,Phoebe," So Chandler, I-I'd love to come by tonight."
203,Chandler," (initially worried, but gets over it) Really?"
204,Phoebe," Oh absolutely. Shall we say, around seven?"
205,Chandler, Yes.
206,Phoebe," Good. I'm really looking forward to you and me having sexual
intercourse."
208,Joey," (looking out the window) Hey-hey, check it out! Check it out! Ugly Naked
Guy has a naked friend!"
210,Rachel," Oh yeah! (She gasps.) Oh my God! That is our friend! (Monica
covers her face.) It's Naked Ross! (Monica turns and buries her face in Chandler's
shoulder.)"
213,Rachel, Show time!
214,Phoebe," Okay, Rachel, get me perfume!"
215,Rachel, Okay! (She runs to get some.)
216,Phoebe," And Joey, get me a bottle of wine and glasses? (He begrudgingly does
so.)"
219,Monica," All right, it'll be great! You just make her think you wanna have sex
with her! It'll totally freak her out!"
220,Chandler," Okay, listen, how far am I gonna have to go with her?"
221,Monica," Relax, she-she's gonna give in way before you do!"
222,Chandler, How do you know?!
223,Monica, Because you're on my team! And my team always wins!
224,Chandler, At this?!
225,Monica, Just go get some! (Kisses him.) Go! (She runs to hide in the bathroom.)
227,Rachel," (handing her the wine) Okay honey, now I'm gonna try to listen from
right here!"
228,Phoebe, Okay.
229,Rachel," Okay? Whoa, wait! (She undoes one button on Phoebe's dress.)"
230,Phoebe, Good idea! 
231,Rachel," Yeah, oh wait! (She goes for another one.) "
232,Phoebe," Oh now, don't give away the farm!"
234,Chandler, Phoebe.
235,Phoebe, Chandler.
236,Chandler, Come on in.
237,Phoebe," I was going too. (They go inside and he closes the door.) Umm, I brought
some wine. Would you like some?"
238,Chandler, Sure.
240,Phoebe," So, here we are. Nervous?"
241,Chandler, Me? No. You?
242,Phoebe," No, I want this to happen."
243,Chandler, So do I.
245,Chandler, I'm gonna put on some music.
246,Phoebe," Maybe, maybe I'll dance for you. (She starts doing a rather suggestive
and seductive dance that's silly at the same time.)"
247,Chandler, You look good.
248,Phoebe," Thanks! Y'know, that when you say things like that it makes me wanna rip
that sweater vest right off!"
249,Chandler," Well, why don't we move this into the bedroom?"
250,Phoebe, Really?
251,Chandler," Oh, do you not want to?"
252,Phoebe," No. No! It's just y'know first, I wanna take off all my clothes and have
you rub lotion on me."
253,Chandler, (swallowing hard) Well that would be nice. I'll go get the lotion.
255,Chandler," Listen, this is totally getting out of hand! Okay? She wants me to put
lotion on her! "
256,Monica, She's bluffing!
257,Chandler," Look, she's not backing down! She went like this! (He does a little
mimic of her dance.)"
259,Phoebe, He's not backing down. He went to get lotion.
260,Joey," (entering the hall) Oh man! Aren't you guys done yet?! I wanna sit in my
chair!"
261,Rachel," Joey look, just look at it this way, the sooner Phoebe breaks Chandler
the sooner this is all over and out in the open."
262,Joey, Ooh!
263,Rachel, Okay!
264,Joey," I like that! (To Phoebe) Oh, okay! Show him your bra! He's afraid of bras!
Can't work 'em! (He swiftly rips open the front of Phoebe's dress revealing her bra.)"
265,Phoebe," Joey! (Examining the dress.) Wow, you didn’t rip off any buttons."
266,Joey, It's not my first time.
268,Monica, You go back out there and you seduce her till she cracks!
269,Chandler," Okay, give me a second! (Pause) Did you clean up in here?"
270,Monica, Of course.
272,Chandler," Oh, you're-you're going?"
273,Phoebe," Umm, not without you, lover. (She slowly walks over to him and is
showcasing her bra.) So, this is my bra."
274,Chandler," (swallowing hard) It's very, very nice. Well, come here. I'm very were
gonna be having all the sex."
275,Phoebe, You should be. I'm very bendy. (Pause) I'm gonna kiss you now.
276,Chandler, Not if I kiss you first.
278,Phoebe, Ooh.
279,Chandler," Well, I guess there's nothing left for us to do but-but kiss."
280,Phoebe, Here it comes. Our first kiss.
282,Chandler, Okay! Okay! Okay! You win! You win!! I can't have sex with ya!
283,Phoebe, And why not?!
284,Chandler, Because I'm in love with Monica!!
285,Phoebe, You're-you're what?!
287,Chandler," Love her! That's right, I…LOVE…HER!!! I love her!! (They
walk together and hug.) I love you, Monica."
288,Monica, I love you too Chandler. (They kiss.)
289,Phoebe," I just—I thought you guys were doing it, I didn't know you were in
love!"
290,Joey, Dude!
291,Chandler," And hats off to Phoebe. Quite a competitor. (Pause) And might I say
your breasts are still showing."
292,Phoebe, God! (She turns and buttons up.)
293,Joey, All right! So that's it! It's over! Everybody knows!
294,Monica," Well actually, Ross doesn't."
295,Chandler," Yes, and we'd appreciate it if no one told him yet."
299,Ross," A new place for a new Ross. I'm gonna have you and all the guys from work
over once it's y'know, furnished."
301,Ross, Well I am that. And that whole rage thing is definitely behind me.
303,Ross," Oh Donald that-that would be great. I am totally ready to come back to
work. I—What? (He notices something through the window.) No! Wh… What are you
doing?!! (Dr. Ledbetter is slowly backing away.) GET OFF MY SISTER!!!!!!!!!!!!! "
0,Ross," Chandler!!! Chandler!!! (He opens the door to the apartment but is stopped
by the chain; Chandler and Monica quickly stop making out and try to get dressed.)
Chandler, I saw what you were doing through the window! Chandler, I saw what you were
doing to my sister! Now get out here!"
1,Chandler," (To Monica) Wow! Listen, we had a good run. What was it? Four? Five
months? I mean, that's more than most people have in a lifetime! So, good-bye, take care,
bye-bye then! (He kisses her and starts to climb out the balcony window.)"
2,Monica, What are you doing?!
3,Chandler," Oh, I'm going on the lamb."
4,Monica," Come on Chandler, come on, I can handle Ross. (They go to the door. Ross
is trying to stick his hand through and undo the chain; Monica pushes his hand back.) (To
Ross) Hold on! (She opens the door.) Hey Ross. What's up bro?"
6,Ross, What the hell are doing?!!
7,Rachel," (running from the guy's apartment with Joey in tow) Hey, what's-what's
going on?!"
8,Chandler," Well, I think, I think Ross knows about me and Monica."
9,Joey, (panicking) Dude! He's right there!
10,Ross," (To Chandler) I thought you were my best friend, this is my sister! My
best friend and my sister! I-I cannot believe this!"
11,Chandler," Look, we're not just messing around! I love her. Okay, I'm in love
with her."
12,Monica," I'm so sorry that you had to find out this way. I'm sorry, but it's
true, I love him too."
14,Ross," (happily) My best friend and my sister! I cannot believe this. (He hugs
them both.) (To Joey and Rachel) You guys probably wanna get some hugs in too, huh? Big
news!"
15,Rachel," Awww, no, it's okay, we've actually known for a while."
17,Ross," What? What? What?! You guys knew? (Joey and Rachel backup against the
door.) You all knew and you didn't tell me?!!"
18,Rachel," Well, Ross, we were worried about you. We didn't know how you were going
to react."
20,Ross," (happily again) You were worried about me? You didn't know how I was going
to react? (He hugs them both.)"
21,Joey," Okay, all right, whew! What do you say we all clear out of here and let
these two lovebirds get back down to business? (Ross turns and glares at him.)
Hey-hey-hey, I-I-I'm just talking here, he-he's the one doing your sister."
24,Ross," Hey, you know what I just realized? If you guys ever have kids…"
25,Chandler, (interrupting) Whoa-whoa-whoa! We're having kids?!
26,Joey, (quickly) I call Godfather!
27,Ross," You can't just call Godfather. Don't you think her brother should
be Godfather?"
28,Joey," Sure, if you cared enough to call it first."
29,Monica," Guys, you're a few steps ahead of us."
30,Chandler," Yeah, big zero gravity moon steps."
31,Rachel," Oh! Oh, I just thought of the greatest wedding gift to get you."
32,Phoebe," Ooh, I'll go in on that with you! I couldn't think of anything."
33,Rachel, Okay.
35,Joey," (to her) Oh, hey Katie! Everyone, this is Katie."
38,Joey," So, are you ready to go?"
40,Joey," Oh sure, right back there. (Points.)"
42,Joey, I was thinking Chinese food.
45,Rachel, She is so cute! You could fit her right in your little pocket!
46,Joey," I don't know. I mean I like her a lot, and she's really nice, but…"
47,Monica, But what?
48,Joey, (shyly) She keeps punching me.
50,Monica," In that cute, little, sweet way she just did?"
51,Joey," Hey, it's a lot harder than it looks! Okay? (Quietly) She-she-she's
hurting me."
52,Monica," I know what you need, you need a bodyguard. Hey Ross, what is Ben doing
after preschool?"
53,Chandler," Hey listen, come on, Joey is having a problem! A little girl is
beating him up."
54,Rachel," Aww, Joey, come here. (She takes his hand.) Look honey, I know this must
be really, really difficult for you and I--Oh, I'm sorry. Am I hurting you?"
56,Ross, (opens it to reveal Phoebe) Hey!
57,Phoebe, Hey! I brought you some house warming gifts.
58,Ross, Aww.
59,Phoebe," Yeah. Salt, so your life always has flavor."
60,Ross, Huh.
61,Phoebe," Bread, so you never go hungry."
62,Ross, Ohh.
63,Phoebe," And a scented candle for the bathroom, because well, y'know."
64,Ross, Thanks. Thanks. And thanks again.
65,Phoebe, Yeah!
68,Ross, Hi!
70,Ross, Oh hi! Ross Geller. And this is my friend Phoebe.
72,Phoebe, Mr. President.
74,Ross, Howard?
76,Ross, Oh that's nice.
78,Ross, Oh. Uhh…
80,Ross," No-no, it's not that, it's just… I-I just moved in."
82,Ross," Yes, but I've lived here for 25 minutes."
84,Ross," No wait, look. Look! I'm sorry, it's just I've never even met
Howard. I-I mean I don't know Howard."
86,Ross," Yes but too me he's just, man."
88,Ross," (To Phoebe) Ugh, can you believe that guy!"
89,Phoebe, Yeah. I really like his glasses.
91,Ross," …so then President Steve told everyone that I was a cheapskate, and
now the whole building hates me! A little kid spit on my knee! Y'know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna throw a party. That's right. For everyone in the building, and I'm gonna sit
them down and explain to them, I am not a bad guy. I am not a cheap guy! I'm just a guy
who-who stands up for what he believes in. A man with principles."
92,Chandler, (To Rachel) Sounds like a fun party.
93,Rachel," Hmm. Look, Ross, if you want your neighbors to like you, why don't you
just pay the hundred bucks? The party's gonna cost you way more than that."
94,Ross, It doesn't matter! It's my principles! We're talking about my principles!
95,Rachel," Okay, I thought it was about your neighbors liking you."
96,Ross," Oh, they'll like me. Once they come to my awesome PAR-TAY! Okay, I gotta
run. I gotta go get some nametags. (Exits.)"
97,Rachel, And that crazy party animal will be your brother-in-law.
98,Chandler," Very, very funny, but don't say things like that in front of Monica. I
don't want you putting any ideas in her head."
99,Rachel," Umm, Chandler, you do realize that those ideas are probably
already in Monica's head."
100,Chandler, Wh-wh-why?!
101,Rachel," Well, because she loves you and because you love her."
102,Chandler," Yeah, so, what's that supposed to mean?!"
103,Rachel," Hey, Chandler, don't freak out! I'm telling you something you already
know! Come on, she broke up with Richard because he didn't want to have babies. And she's
a woman, and she's almost 30, and y'know it's Monica."
104,Chandler," I don't see it that way. Okay? Because, I see two Monicas, the one
that was my friend, who lived across the hall, and wanted to have a lot of babies and then
the new Monica, who I just started to date. Now, who's to say what she wants?!
I’m right. I'm right. Am I right?"
105,Rachel," No, you're right, you are absolutely right. I mean that makes, that
makes everything different."
106,Chandler," Okay. It's not different at all, is it?"
107,Rachel, Not unless different means the same.
110,Joey," (sets the coffee down) Y'know, breadstick fangs are always funny."
112,Joey," Uhh, look Katie, uh listen, we-we need to talk. Okay? Umm, look I like
you. I-I really do, I like you a lot. Okay? But sometimes when you, when you playfully
punch me like that it-it feels like someone's hitting me with a very tiny but very real
bat."
115,Monica, Isn't this great?
116,Chandler, Hmm.
117,Monica," Couldn't you just stay like this forever? (His eyes snap open.)
Chandler! Couldn't you just stay here forever?"
118,Chandler," Yeah, here, somewhere else, y'know where-where ever. (Gets up.)"
119,Monica, Are you okay?
120,Chandler," Yeah, I'm cool. Casual."
121,Monica, What-what are you doing?
122,Chandler," I'm just hanging out. Y'know, having fun. Y'know with the girl that
I'm seeing casually."
123,Monica," Man, I knew it! I knew you were going to do this!!"
124,Chandler, What?!
125,Monica," Get all freaked out because everybody was talking and just joking around
about marriage and stuff."
126,Chandler," Well, you do want all that stuff, right?"
127,Monica, Oh and you know what I want!
128,Chandler, Yes! You want babies! You have baby fever!
129,Monica, I do not have baby fever!
130,Chandler," Oh please, you are obsessed with babies and-and marriage and
everything that's related to babies and-and marriage! I've got an idea, why don't we turn
down the heat on this pressure cooker?!"
131,Monica," Have you lost your mind? Chandler, this isn't about me! This is about
you and all your weird relationship commitment crap!"
132,Chandler," Nah-uh! I know you! Okay? I know the thoughts that you have in the
head--in your head!"
133,Monica," You don't know everything. Did you know that I'm going out with Rachel
tonight instead of you? Hmm? And did you know that the only baby around here is you?! And
did you know that I can't even look at you right now?! (She storms out.)"
134,Chandler," Well, I did not know that."
137,Chandler," It's gonna be okay, right? I mean she's not gonna leave me? This is,
this is fixable."
139,Chandler, By me?
140,Ross," Oh, no!"
141,Joey, No-no.
142,Ross," Well, unless you make some kind of big gesture."
143,Joey," Yeah, big!"
145,Joey," Uh-oh, shht! The Misses."
146,Monica," Gunther, can I get a coffee (Looks at Chandler) to go?"
147,Chandler, Monica. (Goes to talk to her.)
148,Monica, I'm still not done not wanting to talk to you.
149,Chandler, Just tell me what I need to do to make things right.
150,Monica, What?!
151,Chandler," Well, that's what we do. Y'know, I-I mess up and then you tell me how
to fix it and then I do and then y'know you think I'm all cute again."
152,Monica," Really? I'm really tired of being your relationship tutor. You're gonna
have to figure this one for yourself. All right? Y'know what? If you're too afraid to be
in a real relationship, then don't be in one. (She walks out.)"
156,Ross, Phoebe! (He grabs her arm to get her attention.)
157,Phoebe," Oh, hi Ross!"
158,Ross, What are you doing?
159,Phoebe," Oh, I thought this was your party and it turns out it’s a party for
Howard. He's just the sweetest little man! (A guest walks up to her.)"
161,Ross, You chipped in?!
162,Phoebe," Yeah, uh-huh, a 100 dollars."
163,Ross," Phoebe! I can't believe you gave them money! I thought you agreed it was
totally unreasonable that they asked me for that money!"
164,Phoebe," Yeah, but they didn't ask me! Y'know? This way I'm just y'know, the
exotic, generous stranger. That's always fun to be."
165,Ross," Yeah, but you're making me look bad!"
166,Phoebe," No I'm not. No! If anything I'm making you look better! They'll see you
talking to me and that's--I'm a hit!"
168,Phoebe, Hey!
171,Phoebe," Yeah, okay, my bad."
173,Joey, Hey!
174,Rachel," Hi! Wow! You look, you look…big."
175,Joey," Thanks! I've been working out. Hey listen, is it obvious that I'm wearing
six sweaters?"
176,Rachel," Uhhh, yeah. But it's not obvious why."
177,Joey," Well look, I’m breaking up with Katie so I had to put on some extra
padding. Y'know? I mean, if she hits me when she's happy, can you imagine how hard she's
gonna hit me when I tell her I'm taking away the Joey love?"
179,Joey, Hey! Hiya!
180,Rachel," Hey! Hey, cute jacket!"
182,Rachel," Oh! Ow! (Joey motions, ""You see what I mean?!"")"
184,Rachel," Whoa! (Laughs) Y'know what Katie? I gotta tell ya I-I-I-I think you are
the one who is too much. (She punches Katie back.)"
186,Rachel," Ohh, and the nicest girlfriend! (She retaliates.)"
188,Rachel," Ohh, you're so sweet! (She kicks Katie in the shin.)"
190,Joey, Huh.
192,Joey, Uhh….
194,Joey, Nah.
197,Ross, (trying to get her attention) Phoebe?
198,Phoebe," (ignoring him and continuing her conversation) That's what I'm saying.
(Laughs.)"
199,Ross, (tapping her on the shoulder) Phoebe? Phoebe?
200,Phoebe, Ooh. (Turns to him.)
201,Ross," Look, this is a disaster! Can't I please just go?"
202,Phoebe," No! No! I'm talking you up to people. Just give it a little time, all
right? Relax, get something to eat! Okay?"
204,Ross," So uh, what did you tell them about me?"
205,Phoebe," Oh, I was telling them about you and Emily. Y'know, try to get some
sympathy."
206,Ross, Ohh. (He cuts himself a piece of cake.)
207,Phoebe, But somehow you came off as the bad guy.
208,Ross, What?!
209,Phoebe," Yeah, I think I told it wrong. Y'know, we should talk about that because
I don't totally understand what happened there."
210,Ross," (trying a piece of cake) Ohh, this cake is really good!"
211,Phoebe," Oh, okay, see? Things are looking up already!"
220,Phoebe," All right, everyone calm down! Everyone calm down! I have something that
I would like to say! Who here likes Ross? (Ross is the only one who raises his hand and
Phoebe glares at him to put his hand back down.) Of course you don't like him! He-he
didn't give you any money, he raised his own hand when I asked, ""Who hear likes
Ross,"" and he's wearing two nametags! (He takes one off.) I-I'll be honest with you
guys, when I first met Ross I didn't like him at all! But then once I got to know him I
saw that he's really sweet and caring and very generous. I mean, all I'm saying is
don't judge Ross before you get to know him all right? I mean, I like all you guys now,
but when I first meet you y'know Kurt, I thought, y'know abrasive drunk, umm Lola, mind
numbingly stupid! And okay, you guys (She turns to an elderly gentleman and a 20 something
woman, who're a couple.) (To the girl) Gold-digger, (To the old guy) cradle robbing perv!
So, I think you all know what I mean."
222,Phoebe," Obviously I didn't think they were gonna start throwing things. I just
thought if I kept insulting everyone, you would jump in and defend everyone and then you
could look like the hero."
223,Ross," Oh wow, yeah! See, I did not get that."
225,Chandler," Where's Monica?! Where is she? I need to talk to her! It's urgent! Is
she here?"
226,Monica, (raising her hand) I'm Monica.
227,Chandler," I need to talk to you, it's urgent!"
228,Monica, Okay.
229,Chandler," Okay, I've been doing a lot of thinking about us, y'know a lot of uhh,
us thinking. And uh, well I guess there's only one-one way to do this. (He slowly and
awkwardly gets down on one knee.)"
230,Monica, Wait what-wh-wh-what are you doing?!
231,Chandler, (getting out a ring box) Monica…
232,Monica," No-no, don't-don't-don't do it!"
233,Chandler, Will you marry me?
235,Ross, Oh-no. No. No.
236,Joey, What a bad idea!
237,Rachel," Ohhhh, I cannot look at it! (She doesn't move.)"
238,Monica," Chandler, why are you doing this?"
239,Chandler, I don't know. But I know I'm not afraid to do this.
240,Monica, Chandler.
241,Chandler, I'm doing this because I'm sorry?
242,Monica," Do you umm, you really think the best reason to get married is because
you're sorry?"
243,Chandler," No, the best reason to get married is pregnancy. Sorry is pretty much
fourth y'know, behind being ready and actually wanting to get married. (Laughs.)
Will you be my wife?"
244,Monica," (kneels with him) Chandler, umm, I want you to take just a minute and I
want you to think about how ridiculous this sounds."
245,Chandler," Yeah, I'm kinda wishing everyone wasn't here right now."
246,Monica," Honey! Do you know that none of that stuff came from me?! I mean I never
said I wanted to have babies and get married right now!"
247,Chandler," Yeah I know, but I was really confused and then I talked to these
guys. (Turns to look at Ross and Joey.)"
248,Monica, Who? Two divorces and Joey?!
249,Ross, Hey!
250,Joey, She's right y'know.
251,Ross," Yeah, but still, cheap shot!"
252,Monica," Y'know what? Y'know when I said that I want you to deal with this
relationship stuff all on your own? Well, you're not ready for that."
253,Chandler, I didn't think I was!
255,Monica," Oh my God, what would have done if I said yes?"
256,Chandler," Well I would've been happy because I would've be able to spend the
rest of my life with the woman that I love. Or, you would've seen a Chandler shaped hole
in that door. (Points at the door.)"
259,Joey," Hey Ross, will you pass me that knife?"
260,Ross," No, I will not!"
261,Joey," Oh, it's okay. You don't have to be so mean about it."
262,Ross," You're right, I'm sorry. Will you marry me?"
264,Phoebe," Aw, and I was gonna ask you to marry me because I forgot to say hello to
you last week."
265,Rachel," Oh no wait Pheebs, I think for something like that you just ask them to
move in with you. But I'm not sure, Chandler?"
266,Chandler," Okay, how long is this going to go on."
267,Monica," Well I think the length of teasing is directly related to how insane you
were so, a long time."
268,Ross," This is fun. Hey Rach, remember that whole ""We were on a break
thing?"" Well, I'm sorry, will you marry me? (Laughs--whines as he sees that no one is
laughing. They're just staring at him in shock.)"
269,Chandler, That's not funny.
270,Joey, That's not funny at all!
0,Joey, Hey!
1,Chandler, Hey!
2,Monica, Hey!
3,Joey, What are you guys doing up?
4,Chandler," Oh, we wanted to finish the crossword before we went to bed. Hey, do
you know a six-letter word for red?"
5,Joey, (thinks) Dark red.
6,Chandler," Yeah, I think that's wrong, but there's a Connect the Dots in here for
you later. (To Monica) Hey, how about maroon?"
7,Monica," (checks to see if it works) Yes, you are so smart! (Kisses him.)"
8,Joey," Aww, you guys are so cute!"
9,Monica, I know.
10,Joey," All right, I'll see you in the morning."
23,Rachel," (looking at the bill) Uhh, we still need a tip."
24,Phoebe," All right. Hold on. (She starts digging in the chair.) I got it. Nickel!
(Donates it.) How much more do we need?"
25,Rachel, A couple of bucks.
26,Phoebe," Okay, dime! (Donates that.) You guys should probably keep talking; this
could take a while. (Finds something else.) Oh no, wait! Look it! Whoa! (Looks at it.) Oh
my God, this is a police badge!"
27,Monica, Wow!
28,Chandler," Oh that's so cool! Why would a cop come in here though? They don't
serve donuts. (No one laughs.) Y'know what actually, could you discover the badge again? I
think I can come up with something better than that."
29,Rachel," Phoebe, I bet somebody's missing that badge."
30,Phoebe," Yeah, I should probably take it back. Ooh, but you know what? While I'm
at the police station, I could check their Ten Most Wanted lists because my friend Fritzy
has been like number 11 forever, so this could be her year! (She crosses her fingers in
hope.)"
31,Joey," (entering) Hey, you guys!"
32,Chandler, Hey!
33,Rachel, Hey Joey!
34,Monica, Hey.
35,Joey," (To Monica) Hey. That uh, that my sweatshirt?"
36,Monica," Oh yes, it is. I'm sorry I borrowed it, I was cold. I hope its okay?"
37,Joey," Well uh, it's just that uh, y'know if-if you're gonna be wearing someone's
sweatshirt shouldn't it be your boyfriends--and I’m not him."
38,Monica," I'm sorry, I'll give it back to you."
39,Joey, No-no! No! I mean it's gonna be all smelling like Monica!
40,Monica, Are you saying I smell bad?
41,Joey," No! No, you smell like a meadow. (Pause.) I'm sorry. (Runs to the
bathroom.)"
42,Monica, What's with him?
43,Chandler," Oh, y'know what? The last time Joey went to a meadow, his mother was
shot by a hunter."
45,Rachel, (disgusted at Ross's antics) Ugh!
46,Ross," (To Rachel) Yeah, I still don't know. (To the salesman who is hovering
nearby) I'm sorry I just wanna make sure that I bought the right couch. I need a couch
that says, ""Kids welcome here."" But that also says, (In a sexy voice) ""Come
here to me!"""
47,Rachel, What?! You say that to kids?!!
48,Ross," No! No! No! The ""Come here to me"" is y'know for the ladies."
49,Rachel," Ross, honey, it's a nice couch. It's not a magic couch."
51,Ross, Yeah?
53,Ross," Oh, sure. Whoa-whoa, what's this? The delivery charge is almost as much as
the couch!"
54,Rachel," Wait! No, that's ridiculous. Come on, he lives three blocks away!"
55,Ross," Yeah, y'know what? I'll take it myself, thank you! (He signs the form and
hands it back to the salesman.) All right Rach, let's go! (He picks up one end of the
couch.)"
56,Rachel," Yeah! (She puts on her coat and turns around and sees Ross is expecting
her to help.) (Laughing.) Are you kiddin'?"
57,Ross," Oh, come on it's only three blocks! And-and, it's not very heavy, try it!
Come on! Come on!"
58,Rachel," (Disgustedly she goes and tries to pick up the couch. Much to her
amazement, she is successful.) Oh. Oh! I can do it!"
59,Ross, Yeah!
61,Ross," Oh yeah, we're uh, yeah we're not together. (He starts backing out of the
store.)"
63,Rachel, Ross!
64,Ross, What's that supposed to mean?
65,Rachel, Ross!
67,Ross," Not that it's any of your business, but we did go out."
69,Ross, Yeah! Rach?
70,Rachel," Come on, I don't really want to be doing this right now. I am carrying a
very heavy couch."
71,Ross, Then tell him quickly.
72,Rachel, (To Ross) Fine! (To the salesman) We went out.
73,Ross," Not only did we go out, we did it 298 times!"
74,Rachel, Ross!! Oh my--ugh!! You kept count?! You are such a loser!
75,Ross, A loser you did it with (To the salesman) 298 times!
78,Phoebe," Oh. Oh! Ma'am? Excuse me, ma'am? "
80,Phoebe, You can't put your cigarette out on a tree!
82,Phoebe, No but you shouldn't! Don't ever do that again.
84,Phoebe, Hold it! (Grabs the badge) N.Y.P.D! Freeze punk!
86,Phoebe," Yeah that's right you are so busted. (To no one in particular.) Book
'em."
88,Phoebe," Save it Red! Unless you wanna spend the night in the slammer, you
apologize to the tree."
90,Phoebe," You apologize to the tree right now or I am calling for backup. (The
woman calls her bluff.) (Screaming at no one in particular) Backup! Backup!!"
92,Phoebe," Okay, cancel backup! Cancel backup!"
94,Ross, Okay. (Throws off the last cushion.)
95,Rachel," Ross, didn't you say that there was an elevator in here?"
96,Ross," Uhh, yes I did but there isn't. Okay, here we go."
98,Ross," Okay, go left. Left! Left! (The bottom of the couch is hitting the
railing.)"
99,Rachel," Okay, y'know what? There is no more left, left!"
100,Ross," Oh okay, lift it straight up over your head! Straight up over your head!
You can do it! You can do it! (She gets it lifted up and they make the first turn.) Okay.
You got it?"
101,Rachel, Yeah.
102,Ross, Good-good-good. 
103,Rachel, Oh-oh! 
105,Ross," Yeah, you got it right? You got it right? You got it? "
107,Rachel, Any chance you think the couch looks good there?
109,Phoebe," …so this guy was all (Mumbles.) And I'm all, Buffay, Homicide.
(Flashes the badge.) It was just so cool!"
110,Monica," (cooking something) Phoebe, you were supposed to take that back!"
111,Phoebe, I know but I'm having so much fun doing good deeds.
112,Chandler," Okay, but impersonating a police officer is a serious thing. You could
get arrested."
113,Phoebe," You could get arrested, right now! (Flashes the badge and they glare at
her.) All right, yeah, I gotta take it back. I'm totally drunk with power. (She heads for
the door just as Joey enters.)"
114,Phoebe, (To Joey) Hey.
115,Joey, (To Phoebe) Hey! (Sees that Monica's there.) Oh.
116,Chandler," Hi, Joe."
117,Joey," Yeah, I didn’t know you guys were going to be here."
118,Monica," Hey Joey, sweetie, taste this. (Holds out a spoon for him.)"
119,Joey, (backing away) What?! Why?!
120,Monica, What is going on with you?
121,Joey, Nothing!
122,Chandler," Oh, come on! You've been acting strange all day!"
123,Joey," All right! There is something. I kinda had a dream, (pause) but I don't
want to talk about it. (Starts for his room.)"
124,Chandler," Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-what-what if Martin Luther King had said
that? (Imitating what his famous speech would sound like.) I kinda have a dream! I
don’t want to talk about it."
125,Joey," Well, it involved Monica."
126,Chandler," You had a dream about a girl that I am seeing?! Oh, that is so cool!
(To Monica) I can't tell you how many times I've dreamt about a girl that he was seeing.
(Seeing Monica's stare.) (To Joey) Anyway we're talking about your dream. (To Monica) I
love you. (To Joey) Your dream? (Leans in to listen closely.)"
127,Joey," Don't worry, there wasn't any sex in it or anything. I haven't dreamt
about her like that since I found out about you two--ish. "
128,Monica, What was the dream about?
129,Joey," Well, okay. You were my girlfriend and we were doing the crossword
puzzle. Y'know like you guys were doing last night. So, that's it. I'm in love with Monica
and I'll be moving out."
130,Monica," Wait, Joey! Joey! That doesn’t mean that-that you're in love with
me!"
131,Joey, It-it doesn’t?
132,Monica, No!
133,Chandler," No, it can mean anything. Like uh, all of the sudden you're jealous
because I've become the apartment stud."
134,Joey, That kinda sounds like your dream dude.
135,Monica," Or, it could mean that-that you saw Chandler and me together and we
y'know were being close and stuff and then you just want to have that with someone too."
136,Joey, In the dream I did enjoy the closeness.
137,Monica, Um-hmm.
138,Chandler," Joey, look, are you attracted to Monica? Right here, right now, are
you attracted to her?"
139,Joey, (looks at her) Not really.
140,Chandler, Well there you have it!
141,Monica," Well sure! I'm just wearing sweats! (Looking at Chandler and slowly
realizing what his point is.) But that's good that you're not in love with me, because you
just want a girlfriend!"
142,Joey," No, I don't think it's just about just getting a girlfriend. Y'know? I
mean, yeah, I can get a girlfriend! Yeah, we could sit in the chair and do crosswords, but
y'know are we ever going to have y'know the closeness like-like you guys have?"
143,Chandler," Well y'know, Monica and I were friends before we started
dating. So maybe-maybe that's it?"
144,Joey, Friends first? That's interesting.
145,Monica, You become friends after?
146,Joey," No, never done that either."
147,Rachel," (entering) Hey, umm, do you guys have that tape measure?"
148,Chandler," Oh yeah, it's actually in my bedroom."
150,Monica, (laughing) That's right.
152,Rachel, (noticing him) What's up Joey?
153,Joey, (in a sexy voice) How you doin'?
157,Phoebe," Excuse me, is this your car?"
159,Phoebe," Well I don't think it's very nice of you to park here, y'know you're
blocking the entrance. "
161,Phoebe," Well, it's a problem for me, which means it's a problem for you 'cause
I'm a cop. (Shows the badge.)"
163,Phoebe," Ohh, no. (Pause) Oh okay, so you're a cop which means you can park
anywhere, 'cause I know that 'cause I'm a cop too. So, all right, keep up the good work.
10-4. (Tries to leave.)"
165,Phoebe," I-I'm with the umm, the 57th."
167,Phoebe," I'm in vice. Yeah, in fact I'm undercover right now. I'm a whore."
169,Phoebe," Umm, do you know, umm Sipowicz?"
171,Phoebe," Yeah, big guy, kinda bald."
173,Phoebe," (starts to walk away, but stops) Don’t try to call him or anything,
'cause he's not there, he's out. His umm, his partner just died."
175,Phoebe," I-I sure will, take care. (Starts walking off.)"
177,Phoebe," Oh. (She starts laughing. Then she throws the badge at him and runs
away.)"
179,Rachel," Hey! Joey, would you mind giving me and Ross a hand moving his couch?"
180,Joey," Oh, I'd love too, but I got acting class. But y'know what? I guess I can
blow that off, (In a sexy voice) for you."
182,Rachel, Thanks!
183,Joey," Uh, hey, Rach let me ask you something. Uh, I was just over there talking
to Monica and Chandler, boy they are really tight."
184,Rachel, I know.
185,Joey," Yeah that's not such a bad situation they got going over there. I'm
thinking of getting me one of those."
186,Rachel, What's up Joe?
187,Joey," Well, the reason I think Monica and Chandler are so great…"
188,Rachel, Yeah?
189,Joey," …is because they were friends first. Y'know? So I asked myself,
""Who are my friends?"" You and Phoebe, and I saw you first. So…"
190,Rachel, (laughing) What are you saying?
191,Joey, I'm saying maybe you and I crank it up a notch.
192,Rachel," Y'know honey, umm, as uh, as flattered as I am that uh, you saw me
first, uhh, I just, I-I don't think we should be cranking anything up."
193,Joey, I'll treat you real nice. (Pulls out a chair for her.)
194,Rachel," (laughs and pushes the chair back in) Yeah, well, y'know umm… No
honey, listen I think it's a great idea to become friends with someone before you
date them, but I think the way you do it is y'know you meet someone, become their friend,
build a foundation, then you ask them out on a date. Don't hit on your existing friends!"
195,Joey, Won't-won't that take longer?
196,Rachel," Yeah. Yeah. Oh, but once you find it, ohh it's so worth the wait."
197,Joey," Yeah. I understand. I understand. (Pause) Man, I wish I saw Phoebe
first!"
199,Ross," Come here to me. No-no, you come here to me."
200,Rachel, (entering) Hey Ross! I brought reinforcements.
201,Ross," Oh great! What, you brought Joey?"
202,Rachel," Well, I brought the next best thing."
203,Chandler, (entering) Hey!
204,Ross, Chandler?! You brought Chandler?! The next best thing would be Monica!
205,Chandler," Y'know, I would be offended, but Monica is freakishly strong, so…"
206,Ross," Look, I-I drew a sketch about how we're gonna do it. (Showing them) Okay
Rach, (points to the sketch) that's you. That's the couch. (Points again.) "
207,Rachel," Whoa-oh, what's-what's that? (Points.)"
208,Ross," Oh, that's me."
209,Rachel, Wow! You certainly think a lot of yourself.
210,Ross, No! That's-that's my arm!
211,Chandler," (looking at the sketch) Oh, I see. I thought you just really, really
liked your new couch."
212,Ross, Y'know what? Just-just follow my lead. 
214,Rachel, Okay!
215,Chandler, Okay.
216,Ross," Come on, Chandler. "
218,Ross," All right. (They start up the stairs. Ross is first.) Okay, here we go!"
220,Ross," All right, ready?"
221,Chandler, Yeah.
222,Ross, Turn.
223,Chandler, (straining) Okay.
224,Ross, Turn! Turn!
226,Chandler," Okay, I don't think we can turn anymore!"
227,Rachel," Ross, I don't, I just don't think it's going to fit."
228,Ross," Oh yeah it will! Come on, up! Up-up-up! Up! Yes! Here we go! Pivot! (They
start up the stairs again. Chandler is between the couch and the wall now.) Pivot! Piv-ot!
Piv-et!! Piv-ett!!! Piv-et!"
229,Chandler, Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!!
231,Ross," Okay, I don't think it's going to pivot anymore."
233,Ross," All right, let's uh, let's bring it back down and-and try again."
235,Chandler," Okay, yeah, I think it's really stuck now."
236,Ross, I can't believe that didn't work!
237,Rachel," I know, me neither! I mean, you had a sketch!"
238,Chandler," Oh, y'know, what did you mean when you said pivot?"
240,Joey, (entering) Hey!
241,Rachel, Hey! How's it going? Did you make any new friends?
242,Joey," Yeah, yeah, I met this woman. (Starts for his room.)"
243,Chandler," (stopping him) Hey, whoa-whoa! What's she like?"
244,Joey," Uhh, well, she's…really good in bed."
245,Monica," Joey, I thought you were gonna try to be friends first!"
246,Joey," (To Rachel) Well look, hey, it's all your fault!"
247,Rachel, What?! Why?!
248,Joey," Well because you didn't give me advice! No! You gave me a pickup line! As
soon as I told her I wanted to y'know, build a foundation and be friends first. I
suddenly, through no fault of my own, became irresistible to her! (Pause) And her
roommate!"
249,Monica, What about the closeness?
250,Joey, Closeness-shmoshness! There was three of us for crying out loud!
252,Joey," (entering) All right! Hey, who wants pizza?!"
253,Chandler," Ooh, I do! I do! I do!"
255,Joey," (taking a bite) Oh, great! Can you believe I found it on the second floor?
"
257,Monica, Who is it?
260,Joey," Uhh, just a minute officer!! "
263,Phoebe," Ooh, God, it's him! It's that cop! God, I can't believe it! He found me!"
264,Rachel," Oh my God, Phoebe, are you gonna go to jail?!"
265,Phoebe," Well, if I'm going down, I'm taking you (Points at all of them) with me.
(They all look at her.) Harboring a fugitive? That's one to three years minimum. Good luck
Chandler. (She opens the door to the cop from before.) Okay, you can arrest me. Fine. But
you'll never make it stick and you know it!"
267,Phoebe," Yep! As long as you understand that I'm going to call my lawyer and once
he puts you on the stand he'll make you look like a fool. A fool!"
269,Phoebe, I would love it if I weren't here!
271,Phoebe, Me?!
274,Phoebe, Wow! I didn't see that coming! You're-you're asking me out!
276,Phoebe," Umm, yeah, I'd like to go out with you officer…"
278,Phoebe, Gary.
280,Phoebe," Yeah! So--ooh, I gotta ask you though. How did you know where to find
me?"
282,Phoebe," Ohh, impressive."
284,Phoebe," Yeah, we'll talk at dinner."
286,Phoebe," All right, I can't wait!"
289,Chandler, (To Rachel) He has a gun!
292,Ross, I'd like to return this couch. I'm not satisfied with it.
295,Ross, That's what I'm telling you.
297,Ross," This couch, is cut in half! I would like to exchange it for one
that is not cut in half!"
299,Ross," Look, I am a reasonable man. I will accept store credit."
301,Ross, (thinks) I take it.
0,Rachel," Good, you guys are all here!"
1,Ross, Hey! What's up?
2,Rachel," Well, I have a job interview at Ralph Lauren tomorrow!"
4,Rachel, I know!
5,Joey," Boy, that guy's underwear sucks!"
6,Rachel, Wh-what?!
7,Joey," I got this pair marked excess, I gotta tell ya, there was no room for
excess anything in there."
8,Rachel," Anyway, I'm going to be the coordinator of the woman's collection, I'll
work right under the director, it's the perfect, perfect job for me!"
9,Phoebe," Wow! Well, if you nail the interview, you'll get it!"
10,Rachel, Yeah.
11,Phoebe, You wanna work on your interview skills?
12,Rachel, O-okay!
13,Phoebe," Okay! All right, let's start with the handshake. Hi."
14,Rachel, Hi. 
16,Phoebe," Very good handshake, good wrist action."
17,Monica, Let me try. (Gets up to join them.)
18,Phoebe," Okay. (They shake hands and she pulls away suddenly) Oh my God! What did
I ever do to you?! (Rubbing her hand.)"
19,Monica, Did I squeeze it too hard?
20,Phoebe," Let's just say, I'm glad I'm not Chandler."
24,Joey," That's right Ross, I can see you in your new apartment! And you can see
me! Same as yesterday, (To Monica) same as the day before."
25,Monica, Is he doing his shark attack bit yet?
26,Joey," Nope. Op, wait! There he goes. "
28,Joey," (waving) Very funny Ross! Very life-like and funny. Okay. (Notices that a
woman is waving back.) Oh no-no-no, I wasn't waving at you lady. (She just stares at him.)
(Joey sees how beautiful she is.) Whoa, maybe I was! Hey, Monica, this totally hot girl in
Ross's building is flirting with me."
29,Monica," Get in there man! Flirt back, mix it up!"
30,Joey," Yeah, I-I-I'm down with that. (He turns back to the woman.) Okay, here
goes. (Thinks.) How (Holds up his hand like an Indian) you (Points at her) a-doin'? (Does
a little twisting motion with both hands and ends up pointing at her, he then winks. She
smiles and waves again.) (To Monica) It worked! She's waving me over. (Towards the woman.)
Okay, I-I-I'll be right over. Let's see, she's on the third floor…"
31,Monica," (joining him) Wow! She is pretty, huh?"
32,Joey," Tell me about it, huh? (Realizes that she can see Monica.) Oh no-no-no,
I'm not with her, she's just Monica! (He pantomimes that out.) Ewwuck! (He pushes Monica
away and makes a disgusted face.)"
34,Ross, Hey Joey! Great stuff huh?
35,Joey, This is your place?
36,Ross," Of course it is. Yeah, come on in. Ooh-ooh, go by the window you can
pretend to be surfing. (He pretends he's surfing by the window.)"
37,Joey," But I counted, you're not supposed to live here! Oh man! (Runs away.)"
39,Joey, Ugh!!
40,Monica, What happened?
41,Joey," I ended up at Ross's place. Oh, I musta missed counted or something.
(Looks out the window.) Damn! She's not there anymore. Oh, l-l-look, Ross is doing his
'Watching TV' bit. (We see Ross sitting on the couch and flipping through the channels on
his remote.)"
42,Monica," No Joey, I think he's just watchin' TV. "
47,Phoebe," But it's just so unfair that our date has to get cut short just 'cause
some guy shot at a store clerk."
49,Phoebe," Okay, then maybe I can come too!"
51,Phoebe," All right, you go. (They kiss.)"
53,Phoebe," 'Kay, bye!"
55,Phoebe, Oh God!
56,Monica, What?
57,Phoebe, Oh I just miss him so much!
58,Monica," Wow! For just a week you guys are really close, huh?"
59,Phoebe," Yeah, it's weird. I can't help it though he's so sweet, he's like this
little puppy dog, y'know? But like a really tough one that shots bad guys. Ohh, I just love
beginning parts of relationships, y'know?! You just like can't keep your hands off each
other."
60,Monica, I know it is the best.
61,Phoebe, So-so how long did that last for you and Chandler?
62,Monica, What? It's still going on.
63,Phoebe," Come on, seriously! When did it end?"
64,Monica," I-I am serious, I mean, we're, we're all over each other all the time."
65,Phoebe," Okay, you know where you are better than I do. I was just curious."
66,Monica," (Start annoying hyper-competitive mode now.) (Jumping up) What don't you
just calm down Phoebe! All right?! Why don’t you just get all your facts before you
run around telling everybody that you're the only hot couple!!"
67,Phoebe," (Under her breath) God, I woke the beast. Sorry. (To Monica) I was wrong
obviously, I just—I misspoke. It's okay."
68,Monica," Oh no, it is okay, I mean as long as you know that Chandler and I
are also very hot and fiery, just as hot as you! I mean our flame, whew, is on fire!"
69,Chandler," (entering) Hey Monica, here's your broom back."
70,Monica, You are so cute. (She goes over and kisses him passionately.)
72,Chandler," Oh hey, how'd the interview go?"
73,Rachel," Ugh, horrible! I did the stupidest, most embarrassing thing!"
74,Joey," Did you tell the guy you wanted to have sex with his wife and then fall
right out of your chair?"
75,Rachel, No!
76,Chandler, So what happened?
77,Rachel," Ugh, it was horrible! And-and the interview part went so well, y'know? I
even made him laugh. He said something about a boat and I was like, ""Well, yeah! If
you've got enough life jackets!"" (She starts laughing; Chandler and Joey are not
amused.) Trust me, it was actually, it was very funny. Anyway, so we were saying good-bye
and ugh!"
78,Joey, What happened?
79,Rachel," (We see a flashback as Rachel describes what happened.) All right, we
were shaking hands and he kinda leaned toward me… Y'know maybe he was going to open
the door, but I totally miss read him and I uhhh… (The flashback shows that she
kissed him on the cheek.)"
80,Joey, You kissed him?!
81,Rachel," Well, I didn't know what else to do!"
82,Chandler," Well you coulda tried, not kissing him."
83,Rachel, Thanks Chandler.
84,Monica," (entering from the bathroom) Hey Rach, a guy from Ralph Lauren
called, you got a second interview!"
85,Rachel, I can't believe it! I got a second interview!
86,Monica, Yes!
87,Joey," I bet that kiss isn't looking like such a big mistake now, is it?"
88,Rachel," What-what, wait a minute, you don't think that's why he wants me back?"
89,Joey, Yeah! (Chandler makes a noise) No?
90,Monica, A kiss? What are you talking about?
91,Rachel," I accidentally kissed him in the interview, and now he wants me back
y'know of course, 'cause ""Let's bring the girl back who kisses everybody!"""
92,Chandler," Come on, Rach."
93,Rachel," Oh my God! What if he thinks I'm the kind of girl that-that would just
sleep with him?"
94,Monica, He probably wants you back because you're right for the job.
95,Rachel," Maybe. I-I don't know—Oh God, how could I be so stupid?!"
96,Joey," Oh Rachel look, don't say that, I think you just need a hug from Joey.
Come on. Come on. (She hugs him and Joey looks out the window.) She's back! Hot girl's
back!"
97,Rachel," Ohh, well I'm not totally back yet, but thank you."
98,Joey," No, in Ross's building! (He throws Rachel onto the chair and heads to the
window.) She's back! She's back! (Pantomimes) Okay, wait there, I'll be over in a second.
(He counts where she is again.) Got it! (Runs out and does a little hot over a chair.)"
99,Chandler," I gotta check out this hot girl! (He heads to the window but realizes
something, stops, turns and points at Monica.) There she is! (He dances over to her and
kisses her.)"
101,Joey, Damnit!! Did you move?!
102,Ross," Yes. I lived with you guys for a while and then I found this place. (Joey
just stares at him) I'm Ross."
105,Joey, (Looking around) Uhh do you happen to have a hot girl in there?
107,Joey," Yeah. Sorry about that. (He walks away and knocks on the next door which
is answered by a little girl.) Oh, hey little girl. Uhh, is-is your mommy, or sister, or
babysitter by any chance a hot girl?"
109,Joey," Later! (He runs away down the hall and hides behind a corner to a whole
other corridor.) Oh man! (Walks down the hallway in desperation.) Hot girl! Hot girl!!"
112,Rachel, Hi!
116,Rachel, Thank you.
118,Rachel, What?
120,Rachel, Excuse me?
122,Rachel," (stopping him) Wh-whoa! All right, okay-okay, I see, I see what's going
on here! Now listen, look-look, I'm sorry if I gave you the wrong impression, but I am not
some hussy who will just sleep around to get ahead! Now even though I (He tries to
interrupt and tell her about the ink), hey-hey-hey, even though I kissed you, that does
not give you the right to demand sex from me. I do not want, this job that
bad. Good day, sir. (She storms out of his office.)"
124,Rachel," (entering) Ugh, you will not believe what that sleaze-ball from Ralph
Lauren did too me!"
126,Rachel, Okay-okay that-that's amazing. How did you know that?
127,Ross, You got ink on your lip.
128,Rachel, Oh. (Realizes.) Ohhhhhhhhh….
130,Chandler," (To Gary) So what do you say, maybe sometime I hold your gun?"
132,Chandler," Oh, what can happen? I mean, would you… (He gestures and spills
some of his coffee.)"
134,Monica," Phoebe, do you want to go see a movie after dinner tonight?"
135,Phoebe," Oh we can't, we already have plans."
136,Monica, What are you doing?
137,Phoebe," Well, same thing we did all day, hang out at Gary's apartment. He is so
amazing, we never left the bedroom. But have fun at the movie."
138,Monica," (That annoying competitiveness thing kicks in again, what the heck is
that with her and why must the writers show it every flippin' episode?!) Oh, we're not
seeing a movie!"
139,Phoebe, You're not? Then why did you ask us if we wanted to go?
140,Monica," Oh umm, that's because I just wanted to y'know walk in on me and
Chandler while we were, y'know, doing it all night. Will you excuse me for just a second?"
141,Phoebe, Yeah!
142,Monica," Okay. (She gets up and walks over to Chandler.) Chandler? Can I see you
for a second?"
143,Chandler," Uh, yeah."
144,Monica," Okay. (They walk away to get some privacy.) We have got to beat
them! {Here we go yet again.}"
145,Chandler, Why?
146,Monica," 'Cause, Gary and Phoebe think they're a hotter couple than we are!"
147,Chandler," Ohh, so?"
148,Monica," So! So we've got to go upstairs and have a lot of sex to prove them
wrong!"
149,Chandler," Monica, you have got to stop this competitive thing! Okay? It's
crazy. {Finally! The voice of reason.} I mean, just impress Gary and Phoebe we have to go
upstairs and have sex over and over and I'm saying no to this, why? Get your coat."
152,Ross, (to the woman checking her mail next to him) Hey!
155,Ross, (to the woman checking her mail) Who isn't? 
157,Ross," I don't, I don't think we've meet. I-I'm Ross."
159,Ross, Nevermind! (Goes back to his mailbox.)
161,Ross, I had just moved in. Thank you! Listen umm…
163,Ross," Jen, I know this may sound a little…(makes some kind of crazy noise)
But uh, would you maybe wanna grab a cup of coffee sometime, or…"
165,Ross, Umm?
167,Ross, I will give you a call.
169,Ross, Okay!
173,Chandler, That was amazing!
174,Monica, Phoebe and Gary are so gonna hear about this at dinner.
175,Chandler, That was amazing.
176,Monica," We are the hottest! Huh? No one is hotter than we are! You're the
best."
177,Chandler," No, you're the best."
178,Monica," No, you're the best."
179,Chandler," No, you're the best."
180,Monica, I am the best.
182,Joey," (entering) Hey guys! (Sees their state of undress) What 'cha been doin'?
(Has a silly grin.)"
183,Monica," (looking out the window) Hey Joey! Isn't that the girl that waved at you
the other day?"
184,Joey," I don't know. But I can see through your sheet. (He looks out the window.)
Yeah, yeah, that's her. But y'know what? Doesn't matter, I'm never gonna get to meet her
anyway."
185,Monica, Why?
186,Joey," Because it's impossible to find her apartment! She lives in some like of
hot girl parallel universe, or something."
187,Monica," What are you talking about? (Pointing out the window.) She obviously
lives on the second floor, seventh apartment from the left!"
188,Joey," No. No. No. She lives on the third floor, eighth apartment
from the left."
189,Monica," No, those first two windows, (Points) that's the lobby. And y'know the
other one over there, that's the stairway. You've been counting wrong."
190,Joey," I did not know that! Thank you Monica. (Starts to leave) I can't
believe I almost lost another girl because of counting."
192,Ross," So uhh, you ready?"
194,Ross," Sure. (He opens the door to Joey. Needless to say, Joey's stunned.)
Joey…"
195,Joey, Dahhhhh!! (Ross has a puzzled look on his face.) No! Noooo!! (Storms off.)
197,Rachel," Ah, first, I-I would like to say thank you for agreeing to see me again."
199,Rachel," (looks around for the camera) Okay. Umm, well, first I would like to
start by apologizing for kissing you and uh, for yelling at you."
201,Rachel," Now you're probably going to hire one of the people who did not ah, (She
puts her hands on his desk blotter and he moves it. Rachel then doesn't know where to put
her hands.) who did, who did not umm, yell at you and storm out, and I think that's a big
mistake and here's why. I made a huge fool of myself and I came back, that shows courage.
When I thought you wanted sex in exchange for this job, I said no. That shows integrity.
And, I was not afraid to stand up for myself and that shows courage. (Suddenly realizes
that she said courage twice.) Okay umm, now I know I already said courage, but y'know you
gotta have courage. And umm, and finally when I thought you were making sexual advances in
the workplace, I said no and I was not litigious. {By the way, litigious means to want to
litigate and litigate is to make a lawsuit against.  So she didn't want to sue him.
  Don't worry, I had to look it up too.} So there you go, you got, you got (counts
them off with her fingers) courage, you got integrity, you got (Pause) courage again, and
not litigious. Look Mr…"
203,Rachel," Zelner! Right! I knew that! I really, really want this job and I think,
I think I would be really good at it."
205,Rachel, (gasps) Oh! You are?
207,Rachel," Really? Oh thank you! Oh… Oh, would it be completely inappropriate
to give you a hug?"
209,Rachel," Okay, well then how about a handshake? (She goes to shake his hand but
misses and touches his groin.) Oh God I'm sorry! Oh God, I'm sorry! I did not mean to
touch that—I mean you there. There. Uhh, okay, so thank-thank you, I'm going
to leave now thank you very much uh-huh, thank you so—Hey! I'll see you Monday!
(Exits.)"
211,Phoebe, You tired Chandler?
212,Monica," You better believe he's tired, after the day we had! If you know what I
mean. You know what I mean?"
213,Chandler," Honey, the tortilla chips know what you mean."
215,Chandler," Oh yeah, it's so cool. (He opens his coat and has it pinned to the
lining.) Now I gotta go, Officer Bing has gotta, 10-100. (Pause, softly) That's pee-pee.
(Heads for the bathroom.)"
216,Monica," Phoebe, you have a, a twig in your hair."
217,Phoebe," Ohh, (laughs) umm, we kinda took a little detour on the way over here."
219,Monica, You didn't!
220,Phoebe, We did! We violated Section 12 Paragraph 7 of the criminal code!
221,Monica, The park huh? A public place.
223,Monica," I hear ya. Excuse me for just a second! (Gets up and heads for the
bathroom as that annoying Gotta-win-at-all-costs-super-competitive thing kicks in again.)"
225,Monica, Hi Chandler.
226,Chandler, Monica! This is the Men's room! (Pause) Isn't it?
227,Monica," Yes it is. You see I've always found the men's bathroom very sexual.
Haven't you?"
228,Chandler," No. And if I did, I don't think we'd be going out. Monica, this is
getting ridiculous!"
229,Monica," Come on, we can't let them win!"
230,Chandler," Ugh, we have already proved that we are hot! Okay? So why-why are you
getting so obsessed about this thing?!"
231,Monica," Because Phoebe and Gary are in
that-can't-keep-their-hands-off-each-other-doing-it-in-the-park phase!"
232,Chandler, (gasps) So?
233,Monica, I feel really sad that we're not…really there anymore.
234,Chandler, Oh wow! Is that what this all have been about?
235,Monica," Wasn't it a lot more exciting when we were y'know all over each other
all the time?"
236,Chandler," Yeah that was great. That was really great! But to tell you the truth,
I'm more excited about where we are right now."
237,Monica, Really?
238,Chandler," Yeah! I've never been in a relationship that's lasted this long
before. Y'know to get past the beginning and still be around each other all the time, I
think that's pretty incredible. And the fact that this is happening all with you, yeah I
think that's pretty exciting. (Kisses her.)"
239,Monica," That is so sweet. I know that I was acting a little crazy but umm, I
feel the same way."
240,Chandler, Yeah?
241,Monica, Yeah. (They hug.)
242,Chandler," Y'know what I just realized? You just freaked out about our
relationship."
243,Monica, Did not.
244,Chandler, Yes you did! Admit it! You freaked out!
245,Monica," Okay, I freaked out a little."
246,Chandler," Little?! You freaked out big time! Okay? And I fixed it! We have
switched places! I am the relationship and king and you are the crazy, irrational
screw up! (Does a dance of joy.) (Monica glares at him.) And now we're back."
250,Rachel, (laughs) I cannot believe Ross is buying this!
251,Monica, Thank God! I can't watch him anymore!
252,Chandler, (entering) You guys ready fore the movies?
253,Rachel," Yeah! Oh by the way, thank you for loaning us Pamela and Yasmine. "
255,Ross," (from his apartment) Man! They cannot get enough! (Makes like he's a robot
and waves at the cutouts.)"
0,Joey," Okay, pick a card."
1,Chandler, Okay. (He picks the 9 of Spades)
2,Joey," All right now, memorize it. (Pause) You got it?"
3,Chandler, Oh yes.
4,Joey, (holding up the Queen of Clubs) Is that your card? (He winks and smiles.)
5,Chandler, (pause) Yes. 
8,Ross, Hi!
9,Chandler, Hi there!
12,Phoebe, What are you talking about?!
13,Ross," (sets Ben down) Well, it's not for sure but umm, we met this guy in the
park who thought Ben was really cute--y'know, which he is--so umm anyhoo, he uh, he gave
us his card and told us to bring him down for this commercial he's auditioning."
14,Joey," (reading the card) Whoa! This guy is like the biggest commercial casting
director in town! (Ross gasps) Ben takes one lousy walk in the park and gets an audition!!
(Ross and Carol stare at him, then Joey realizes what he just said.) I mean, way to go
Ben! (Gives Ben the thumbs up, which Ben returns.) Man! I've been in that park a million
times and no one offered me an audition."
15,Ross," I know, it's crazy! We were just pushing Ben on the swings…"
16,Joey, I'm always on the swings! What am I doing wrong?!
17,Chandler, That.
20,Rachel," (entering from her room) Okay, gotta go! Wish me luck!"
21,Joey, Luck!
22,Chandler," Hey Rach, now that you're working at Ralph Lauren, can you
bring me back some of those polo shirts?"
23,Rachel," Uh well, y'know what? I don't think if I feel comfortable stealing on my
very first day…"
24,Chandler," Unwilling to steal from work, interesting."
25,Monica," Besides, if anybody's gonna get free stuff, it's gonna be me."
26,Rachel," Okay guys, way to wish me luck!"
28,Phoebe," Okay, let's discuss Rachel's birthday. I say we throw a surprise party
this weekend."
29,Joey," Whoa-whoa, but her birthday isn't like for another month."
30,Phoebe," Yeah but if we throw her a party on her birthday, then it's not a
surprise."
31,Monica," I think it's a great idea. Yeah, we could have a dinner party and just
invite her close friends."
32,Joey, Ross!! We're having a surprise party for Rachel!!
33,Ross, (from the bathroom) Okay!!
34,Joey, Done.
35,Phoebe," Okay, great so do you want to do it together?"
36,Monica, I would love to do it together!
38,Joey, They're gonna do it together.
39,Chandler, Dude! That's my girlfriend!
40,Joey," What, so I gotta shut it down now?"
41,Ross," All right, I gotta take off. I'm picking up Ben then we're off to the big
audition."
42,Monica, It's gonna be weird to watch some actor pretending to be Ben's dad.
43,Ross, Yeah.
44,Chandler," Weirder than watching his two moms make out? (Monica nods in
agreement.)"
45,Joey, Whoa-whoa dad? There's a dad in the commercial?
46,Ross, Yeah the dad and Ben eat soup and pretend to enjoy it.
47,Joey," Whoa, hey, maybe I'll go down there with ya and see if I can get an
audition to play the dad. I mean who better to play Ben's father than his godfather."
48,Ross, You're not his godfather.
49,Joey, What?! Are you kidding?!
50,Ross," (Pause) Of course I am! (Joey is relieved) Okay, let's go godfather."
51,Joey, All right!
54,Joey," Hey! I'm in, they're gonna let me audition!"
55,Ross, Really? That's great!
56,Joey," I know! I know! It turns out that one of the casting ladies has actually
seen me in a play, so I steered clear of her…"
58,Joey," Oh yeah, yeah! He's done tons of commercials. I've seen him in like Sugar
Smacks, Playstation, and that one for the phone company. In fact he was so good in
that one, he actually convinced me to switch phone companies. Chandler was mad…."
59,Ross," Yeah well, he's not gonna get this one. Ben is way cuter than that kid. I
mean look at him, look at you, (Starts to whine like a baby and Joey just glares at him.)"
60,Joey," That's great. Listen, wouldn't it be great though if I got to play Ben's
dad?"
61,Ross," Joey, you look nothing like Ben."
62,Joey, I look more like him than you do! (He winks at Carol.)
66,Rachel," Well umm, that one is pretty but uh, I just, I just love this fabric (On
the other one.) Sorry."
69,Rachel," (laughing nervously) Oh, what a fun office."
73,Rachel," Oh no, my dad's a doctor and he would always tell me just horror
stories…(stops and tries to change directions)…about ghosts and goblins who
totally supported the princess's right to smoke."
75,Rachel," …and then they came back from smoking and they had made all of the
decisions without me!"
76,Monica, That doesn't seem fair.
77,Rachel," I know! It's like I'm being punished for not having this disgusting,
poisoning habit!"
78,Chandler," Yeah, it is the best."
79,Rachel," I mean what if this keeps happening? Y'know, they'll-they'll be outside
smoking, making all the decisions and I'll just be up in my office breathing my stupid
clean air, y'know? And then when the day comes when Kim wants to promote one of us, who do
you think she's gonna pick? Me or Smokey Smokerson?"
80,Monica," Rachel, you can go down there, you don't have to smoke. Just say you
wanna get some fresh air."
81,Rachel," Yeah, I can do that."
82,Chandler," Yeah, or you can do the easy thing and smoke."
83,Phoebe, (entering) Hey!
84,Monica, Hey!
85,Phoebe," Hey Rach, you wanna get some coffee?"
86,Rachel, I would love to!
87,Phoebe, Oh good!
88,Chandler," Yeah, I wanna go to babe."
89,Phoebe, Oh good.
91,Phoebe," Oh wait, I change my mind! (She slams the door on them.) Okay, let's
talk about the party! I have so many ideas! (Holds up a cocktail napkin.)"
92,Monica," Yeah, me too! (Runs and grabs her 3-ring binder of ideas.)"
93,Phoebe," Oh, look at that."
94,Monica," All right, that's a little sketch of the cake, umm some sample menus,
umm y'know what I thought we would start out with Tuscan style finger food, and for music,
here's an alphabetized list of all my CDs! I've highlighted the ones that would go really
good with the food."
95,Phoebe, What happened to the intimate dinner party?
96,Monica," Oh, we're not doing that. Okay…"
97,Phoebe," So wow, it looks like you took care of everything. Thanks a lot,
co-host."
98,Monica," What?! I didn't take care of everything, there's-there's plenty of
things for you to do!"
99,Phoebe, Like what?
100,Monica, (Thinks) Cups.
101,Phoebe, Cups? You're giving me cups?
102,Monica, And ice!
103,Phoebe," Cups and ice? Ooh, I get to be in charge of cups and ice? (Thinks of
something) All right. Fine, okay, I will be in charge of cups and ice!"
104,Monica," Wait a minute, I can get ice at the restaurant…"
105,Phoebe, I got it! Mine!
106,Ross," (entering, downtrodden) Hi."
107,Monica, Hey! How'd the audition go?!
108,Ross, Not so good.
109,Monica," Wait a minute, are you doing Joey's (sadly) ""Audition didn't go so
well. (Happily) Yeah it did?"""
110,Ross," (Pause) Yeah I am! Yeah, Ben got a second audition!"
111,Joey," (also downtrodden) Yeah, I had to teach Ross my bit because I actually
didn't get a callback."
112,Monica, You got a callback too didn't you?
113,Joey, (Happily) Yeah I did!
116,Rachel," Oh well, it's kinda lonely up there, so I just thought I would come out
here and get some fresh air."
118,Rachel, Oh great!
121,Rachel, Oh that's okay.
126,Rachel," Excuse me, can I, can I bum one of those? (He holds up his pack.) Y'know
what, actually… (She takes the one he's smoking and heads over to where Nancy and Kim
are standing and laughing.) Okay, okay, okay, what's so funny over here?"
128,Rachel," Oh, I thought you guys meant marijuana cigarettes, y'know? Y'know what I
mean, like dubbies? And I actually, I thought to myself, ""Wow, those guys are
crazy!"" But no, I actually smoke the regular ones all, all the time."
130,Rachel," Oh, me too."
132,Rachel," (Laughs) Oh, me too."
134,Ross," Oh God, this is so nerve wracking! How-how do you do this?"
135,Joey," Well, unfortunately, I don't get many callbacks so…"
137,Joey, Who knows?
139,Ross," Yes!! I knew it!! (To the people who didn't make it.) Bye-bye! So long!
Later!"
140,Joey, Oh this is great! I might actually get to play Ben's dad!
141,Ross, Yeah!
143,Joey," Man, this is gonna be kinda weird."
144,Ross," Yeah, it is."
146,Ross," No, we-we're gonna be like best friends, that's why it's gonna be weird."
150,Phoebe," (entering, carrying two garbage bags) Hey!"
152,Phoebe, Is it okay if I leave this stuff here 'til Rachel's birthday party?
153,Chandler, Ah sure. What's in 'em?
154,Phoebe," Umm, cups."
155,Chandler," Oh good, because uh we got Rachel 800 gallons of water."
156,Ross, Seriously that's a lot of cups.
157,Phoebe," Yeah well, that's 'cause Monica put me in charge of cups and ice, and
Monica is gonna rue the day that she put me in charge of cups and ice."
158,Chandler, Y'know I rued the day once…didn't get a whole lot else done.
159,Phoebe," Okay, time to bring up the rest of the cups. (She goes and opens the
door to Joey.) Oh, hi Joey!"
160,Joey, Hey Pheebs! (To the guys) Hey!
161,Ross, Hey!
162,Joey," Ross good, I'm uh glad you're here. I wanna talk to you about something."
163,Ross, What's up?
164,Joey," Well, I've been thinking about this whole commercial thing, y'know me
going up against Ben, the two of us competing, and that can't lead to anything good. So, I
think I'm just gonna step aside. I'm gonna tell them that I won't audition."
165,Ross," Wow, uh, Joey that's-that's great. Thanks man."
166,Joey," That's it? You're-you're gonna let me do this?! This-this is my career
we're talking about here!"
167,Ross," Well, you just…"
168,Joey," I just said that so you wouldn't let Ben do it! Look Ross, if anyone
should step aside it should be Ben!"
169,Ross, What?!
170,Joey, What? Chandler! Tell 'em!
171,Chandler," (shocked) Well I mean, let me get the door first. (Goes and opens the
door.) Oh, hi! No one. (Exits.)"
172,Ross," Why should Ben step aside? It was his audition in the first place! You-you
just tagged along! You're like the uh, tag-a-long dad."
173,Joey, At least I care about his feelings!
174,Ross, What?!
175,Joey, Do you know how hard this is gonna be on him when he doesn’t get it?
176,Ross, And why wouldn't he get it?
177,Joey," Oh, come on! Have you seen what my kid can do?! Huh?! I mean he
dials phones! He-he-he eats tortilla chips! He-he plays soccer with the cartoon tiger!"
178,Ross, Are you saying your kid eats soup better than my kid?
179,Joey, You just give him a spoon baby!
180,Ross, Oh yeah? I guess we'll just see!
181,Joey, Yeah! Because this commercial belongs to me and Mitch!
182,Ross, You're kid's name is Raymond!
183,Joey, Yeah?! So's yours!
185,Monica, (To Rachel) How did work go?
186,Rachel," Oh it was great! It was great! I went down there just like you said,
y'know? And we talked business. Kim totally took my opinions."
187,Monica, You stink!
188,Rachel, Thanks!
189,Monica," No, I'm-I'm serious!"
190,Rachel," Well-well that's 'cause I went down there and they were all smoking.
This is actually the smell of success."
191,Chandler," Okay, there's something different though--Oh my God! You smoked!"
192,Rachel, I did not!
193,Chandler, Yes you did! You look happy and sick; you smoked!
194,Rachel," All right, fine! But I had too! I had to do it for my career!"
195,Chandler, I wish I had smoked for my career…
196,Monica, That's so gross!
197,Rachel," No well, no it's not that bad, y'know? I mean yeah, my tongue feels a
little fuzzy and these fingers sort of smell, I actually feel like I can throw up."
198,Chandler," Okay, but you gotta push past this because it is about to get so good!"
199,Monica," Chandler! I have to tell you, you smell so smokey I have to get up. I'm
not kidding. (She's not; she stands and walks away. Chandler moves closer.)"
200,Chandler, I think you smell great! (He sniffs her shoulder.)
204,Rachel, I am so on board! (She throws away her recently lit cigarette.)
206,Rachel," Yeah, I did, but y'know what? I am really, really trying to cut back,
y'know? (Laughs) Good luck, Rach."
210,Rachel, Well then let's just quit! We'll just quit! Let's all quit!
213,Rachel," Oh but you could. You can. Absolutely! We can help each other out! We
can get--what are those--those patches! We could be like the Patch Sisters!"
215,Rachel," Yes! Great! Give me those cigs! Give it! Give it! (She grabs their
cigarettes and lighters and throws them in the trash.)"
217,Rachel," Okay then! (She starts rummaging through the trash to find Kim's
lighter.)"
219,Joey," Hmmm, soup! (Tries again.) Hmm soup! (Tries again, with a little
caveman thrown in.) Hmm, soup!"
221,Joey," Oh yeah, no problem."
223,Joey," (goes over to Ben) Hi Ben! So you wanna be an actor huh? I gotta tell ya,
it's no picnic. There's tons of rejection. No stability. One day you're Dr. Drake
Remoray, the next day you're eating ketchup right out of the bottle."
224,Ross," (entering, angrily) Joey!"
225,Joey, (angrily) Ross!
226,Ross," (angrily) Ben! (Pause.) (Happily.) I mean, Ben! Ben!"
229,Joey, Hi!
231,Joey, Uh-oh.
233,Joey," Well this is noodle soup and uh, I've been working with tomato. But that's
okay, no problem. No problem. Hmm, noodle soup."
235,Joey," Oh, what did I say?"
237,Joey, How's that different? (She looks at him until he gets it.) Oh! Yeah!
240,Joey," Hmm, noodle soup."
242,Joey, Okay.
244,Joey," Hmm, soup. (Pause.) I mean, noodle soup. I mean soup!"
247,Joey," No! No! I-I can do it one more time! See? Look! (Eats another spoonful)
Hmm, noodle soup. Damnit! (Storms out.)"
249,Rachel, Hey! Hey-hey-hey!!
251,Rachel, Come on you guys! What are doing?! I thought we were the patch sisters!
254,Rachel," Well y'know if you, if you started smoking again you could've at least
told me! Come on, give me one of those! What are we talking about?"
256,Rachel," Oh wait, no-no-no! Drag me down. Drag-drag me down."
258,Rachel, Okay. (Starts to walk away.)
260,Rachel, (hearing that) Oh man!
262,Phoebe," (To Chandler) Check it out! Cup hat! (Points to her hat.) Cup banner!
Cup chandelier! And the thing that started it all, the cup! (Holds up one.)"
263,Chandler," Great job with the cups, Pheebs!"
264,Monica, (overhearing that) Why don't you just go out with her!
266,Phoebe," (following him) And did you notice the ice? (Gestures to 3 huge buckets
of ice on the table.) Look! We have it all! We have crushed! Cubed! And dry! Watch! (Pours
some water onto the dry ice, causing it to evaporate/smoke.) Ahhh! Mystical!"
267,Chandler, Awesome!
268,Monica," Chandler! Everyone--no one's eating my Tuscan finger food 'cause they're
all filling up on Phoebe's snow cones!"
269,Chandler, There are snow cones! (Monica glares at him.) Snow cones! Yuck!
270,Monica, Y'know…go! Go! Right there! (Points)
271,Chandler, Thank you! Thank you! (Runs to the snow cone machine.)
273,Phoebe," (noticing her) Oh, look! Look! Look!"
275,Rachel, What?! What?! My birthday's not for another month!
276,Monica, That's the surprise!
277,Rachel," Oh my God! You guys this is so great! I mean it's so unexpected! I mean
Chandler's birthday is even before mine!"
280,Rachel, Wow! This is great! Look at all these cups! This is so weird.
281,Phoebe, I was in charge of cups.
282,Rachel," Oh, okay, not so weird."
284,Ross, Hey!
285,Joey, Hey.
286,Ross," Listen man, uh, I'm sorry the audition didn't go so well."
287,Joey, Yeah right! (Gets up for a refill to his snow cone.)
288,Ross," No really, I-I am! I feel bad!"
289,Joey," Yeah? Well look Ross, you don't have to. Okay? It's not your fault I suck.
I mean what kind of an actor can't even say, ""Hmm, noodle soup."" (Nods his head
in disgust.)"
290,Ross," Yeah y'know what? Maybe-maybe you didn't mess up your audition because you
suck, maybe you messed up because you care more about uh, your godson."
291,Joey, What you do mean?
292,Ross," I think, sub-consciously…"
293,Joey," Wait-whoa-whoa, you lost me."
294,Ross," (pause) I think on some level, you-you sabotaged your own audition so that
Ben would get the part."
295,Joey," Well, you're way sounds a lot better than mine. (Thinks about it.) Yeah.
Yeah! It's not that I'm a bad actor…"
296,Ross, No!
297,Joey," No, it's just ah, I care so damn much about little Ben that uh, it was
more important to see him succeed."
298,Ross, There you go. Thank you!
299,Joey," Thank you! So, did-did he get it?"
300,Ross, No.
301,Joey," Eh, what are you gonna do?"
304,Chandler," (to Kim and Nancy) Oh, hi! Excuse me, is uh Rachel Green here? I was
supposed to meet her for lunch."
306,Chandler," Okay, great."
309,Chandler, I'll catch you guys later. (Exits.)
0,Ross, Hey!
1,Chandler, Hey!
2,Ross, Wow! You look nice. What's the occasion?
3,Chandler," Monica and I are celebrating our ten-month anniversary, we've got
reservations at Ja George."
4,Ross, Wow! How'd you get in there?
5,Chandler," Made a few calls, pulled some strings, and they agreed to seat us at
1130 if we both had the chicken and didn't get desert. "
8,Chandler, Hey Caitlin! Somebody got a haircut.
10,Chandler," Yeah, if that was true, gym class would've been a lot more
interesting."
12,Chandler," Oh, okay. (Hands her the money.) Here you go. "
15,Chandler," Oh, he's in the back. The duck pissed him off, said that eggs came
first."
17,Chandler," Okay, bye!"
19,Ross, What the hell was that?!
20,Chandler, What?
21,Ross," The flirting! Aren't you supposed to be going out with, I don't know hmm,
let's say my sister?!"
22,Chandler, I was not flirting.
23,Ross," It was totally flirting. ""Somebody got a haircut (Makes some whiney,
nasally noises.)"""
24,Chandler," Okay first of all, the impression, uncanny. And second, that was not
flirting, that was just casual conversation between two people. That is all."
25,Ross," Yeah, right."
26,Chandler," You wanna see flirting? I'll show you flirting. (Starts to move
towards Ross.)"
27,Ross, (backing away) I'm good.
30,Rachel," I am so proud of Joey, I can't believe he's going to be on Law &
Order!"
31,Phoebe, I know. But don't you think that it should be called Order and Law?
32,Rachel, No because first they arrest the guy and then they try him.
33,Phoebe, Don't get me started on that.
35,Chandler, I was not flirting.
36,Ross," And on your anniversary, for shame!"
37,Rachel, What's going on?
38,Ross, Chandler was hitting on the hot delivery girl!
39,Chandler," I was not and oh God, shh!"
40,Ross," Well I'm sorry but you were! Okay? And besides if anyone should be hitting
on her it's the guy who's single, the guy that who-who-who can do something about it."
41,Phoebe, Sounds like somebody wants to be Mr. Pizza Delivery Girl.
42,Ross, Well…
43,Chandler, Is that what this is about? You like Caitlin?
45,Rachel," Ross! We broke up two years ago; you've been married since then.
I think it's okay that we see other people."
46,Ross," Well, I-I was watching her the other day at the pizza place."
47,Rachel, Hm-mmm.
48,Ross, And she's just so sexy and funny and has the cutest little…
49,Rachel," Okay, y'know what? We don't need her measurements. "
50,Phoebe," (looking through the pizzas) Okay pepperoni, pepperoni, pepperoni, okay
Ross, I know she's pretty and you love her, but is she stupid?! She forgot my vegetarian!"
51,Ross," This is perfect! She'll have to come back here with your pizza, and when
she does, I'll turn on the Charm-O-Ross. Oh I'm so glad you don't eat meat."
52,Phoebe, See? Vegetarianism benefits everyone.
53,Joey," (entering, with his grandmother) Hey everybody, look who's here! You
remember my grandmother!"
54,Rachel, Big night!
55,Phoebe, This is so cool!
56,Chandler," So, Joey on Law & Order, you must be very proud!"
57,Joey," Chandler, she doesn't understand a word of English."
58,Chandler," I'm sorry, I thought you were Joey's other grandmother. (She just
stares at him.) I've done it again."
59,Joey," She's my biggest fan. Yeah, she's the only one in the family that's
believed in me. "
61,Joey," Yeah, I uh weighted like 27 pounds when I was born so…"
62,Monica, (entering from the bathroom) Hey! Happy Anniversary!
63,Chandler," Happy Anniversary, 10 months! (They kiss.)"
64,Monica," So umm, when I was in the shower I was thinking about our first night in
London…"
65,Chandler," Uhh, Joey's grandmother is right there. (Points)"
66,Monica, Is that the one that speaks English or the one that doesn't?
67,Chandler, The one that doesn't.
68,Monica, That was some hot love you gave me! I'm gonna go get ready.
69,Chandler," Hey, why don't you wear those earrings I gave you?"
70,Monica, That's a great idea! I was saving them for something special.
71,Chandler, Okay.
72,Monica, (runs over to Phoebe) You have got to go home!
73,Phoebe, But I like it here!
74,Monica," You gotta go home and get the earrings that you borrowed from me okay?
Chandler wants me to wear them tonight."
75,Phoebe," Okay, well I think that they're in my purse. Why don't you go get
dressed and I'll look for them."
76,Monica, Great!
77,Phoebe," Okay! (Walks over to Rachel) Rach, hi, I need those earrings you
borrowed."
78,Rachel," Oh, umm, okay, yeah, I'll be, yeah I'll be right back. (Goes to her
room.)"
80,Joey," Wow Pheebs, you speak Italian?"
81,Phoebe," I guess so. (See, the brief possession didn't affect her at all, like we
could really tell.)"
82,Rachel, (She enters and hands Phoebe the earring) Here you go. Thank you!
83,Phoebe," Wait, Rach! Where's the other one?"
84,Rachel," Oh what, you-you want both of them?"
85,Phoebe," Rachel Karen Green, where's the other earring?!"
86,Rachel," Okay, okay, okay, look, just don't freak out, but I kinda lost it. I
know it's in the apartment, but I definitely lost it."
87,Phoebe," Well, what am I going to tell Monica? She wants to wear them tonight!"
88,Rachel, Tell her to wear her own earrings.
89,Phoebe, These are her earrings.
90,Rachel," Nooo! Nooooo! You lent me Monica's earrings?! I'm not allowed to borrow
her stuff!"
91,Phoebe, Why not?
92,Rachel, Because I lose her stuff!
94,Joey," Okay, see that blind guy right there? I'm gonna bash his head in later."
96,Joey," Oh umm, my big scene is coming up. Big scene coming up."
97,Chandler," If you said, ""Big lima bean, bubbling up."" Would she
understand the difference?"
98,Monica, (noticing Rachel crawling behind the couch) Rach? What are you doing?
99,Rachel," Oh boy, I just can't watch. It's too scary!"
100,Monica, It's a diaper commercial.
101,Rachel," Oh yeah well, you know me, babies, responsibilities, ahhh!!!"
104,Ross, I'll get it! I will get that! (Runs over and opens the door.)
106,Ross, Hi!
108,Ross," Oh. Uh, by the way, if it makes you feel any better. I happen to like
8-year-old boys."
110,Ross," (I can't make it out.) The uh, your hair, before, your hair, you said you
thought your looks like an 8-year-old's, and I'm just saying I like it. The hair."
112,Ross, You understand I don't actually like 8-year-old boys.
114,Chandler, Here you go. (Hands her the money.) Now stop bringing us pizzas you.
116,Chandler, You're welcome.
117,Ross," You couldn't let me have her, could ya?!"
118,Chandler, What?
119,Ross, This is a girl that I really like and had too swoop in there!
120,Monica, What's goin' on?
121,Ross, Chandler was totally flirting with the hot delivery girl!
122,Chandler, Thank you for that! (To Monica) I was not flirting.
123,Monica," It's okay. I don't care. It's uh, it's fine."
124,Ross, Really?!
125,Chandler, Really?!
126,Monica," It's no big deal, I do it all the time."
127,Chandler," (starts to laugh, but then gets serious) So umm, you-you flirt with
guys all the time?"
128,Monica," Sure! It doesn't mean anything! Just like I know it doesn't mean
anything with you!"
129,Chandler," Okay, but there is a big difference. You are a lot hotter than
I am."
130,Joey, (walking past) True story! (Goes and sits down.)
131,Monica," Chandler, this actually bothers you?"
132,Chandler," Yes, it does bother me! And I think it would bother a lot of people.
Rachel, when you were going out with Ross, did it bother you when he flirted with other
women?"
133,Rachel," Uhh, no, no, it bothered me when he slept with other women."
134,Ross," And thank you, for that."
135,Rachel," But y'know, I never really had anything to worry about. Ross was never
very good at the flirting thing."
136,Ross," What? (Mumbles) What-what, what are talking about? It-it worked with you."
137,Rachel," Oh! Y'know what? You're right! We meet, you flirted and then bamn
nine years later you had me!"
138,Ross," All right, all right. You-you-you know what I'm going to do? I am going to
order another pizza and when Caitlin gets here, you-you--I will show how well I flirt.
Yeah! I will, I will get her phone number! (To Chandler) And not the one on the menu!"
139,Phoebe, (entering from Rachel's bedroom) I found it!
140,Rachel, Ohh! Thank God! Where was it?
141,Phoebe, On your dresser.
142,Rachel, Okay that is the one we already have!
143,Joey," Okay, here's my big scene. My big scene's here! (They have two of the cops
on the street, then they cut to where they're entering an apartment.) Oh my God."
144,Monica, What?
145,Joey," (smiling) Okay, everybody just keep smiling. It'll kill my grandmother if
she finds out."
146,Chandler," (smiling) Well, what is it?"
147,Joey," (smiling) Oh, they cut me out of the show."
148,Rachel, (smiling) What?!
149,Ross, (smiling) Are you sure?
150,Phoebe, (smiling) Maybe your scene's coming up?
151,Joey, (smiling) Not likely.  'Cause you see that body bag right there
152,Rachel, (smiling) Yeah.
153,Joey, (smiling) I'm in it.
156,Phoebe," (smiling) This is terrible, what are you going to do?"
157,Joey," (smiling) I don't know. This little, old lady lives for my career. When
they dumped me off of Days of Our Lives she almost died."
158,Phoebe, (not smiling) That's not good.
159,Joey," (smiling) No, smile! Not that face, smile! Everybody smile! (They all
smile.)"
160,Rachel," (smiling) Joey, why don't you just tell her what happened? It's not your
fault."
161,Chandler," (smiling) If we keep talking this way, aren't we gonna freak her out
soon?"
163,Joey," Soon, soon, I'm gonna be on soon. There I am! (Points to the screen, of
course it isn't him.)"
165,Joey," No-no-no, that-that's me, that's me."
167,Chandler," Doesn't know, ""Hello."" But she knows Capricorn One."
169,Monica," (following her) Phoebe! I have to have those earrings, we're going to
leave as soon as the show is over."
170,Phoebe, But I already gave them back to you!
171,Monica, No you didn't.
172,Phoebe," All right, I already didn't give them back to you, that's what I said.
(Walks away over to Rachel.) Where is that other earring?"
173,Rachel," It's not here Pheebs, it's not here. Ohh, I went to Joey and Chandler's
last night! Okay! (Goes to the door.)"
174,Phoebe, Make sure you check Chandler's jewelry box.
175,Rachel, Wait a minute. Chandler has a jewelry box?
176,Phoebe," Okay, we have like ten minutes. Do you want me to get into that now?!"
178,Ross," (To Phoebe) Hey Pheebs! How's that uh, vegetarian pizza working out for
ya? You and those vegetables have a real thing going on, huh?"
179,Phoebe, (she just looks at him) Why are you being weird?
180,Ross, Do you like it?
181,Phoebe," No, that would be, ""Why are you being cute?"""
182,Ross," Okay, I'm working on my flirting."
183,Phoebe, Ohh! I did not get that.
185,Chandler," So uh Monica, do you, do you like the Law & Order?"
186,Monica," Yeah, it's good."
187,Chandler," See, I'm finding out all this stuff about you today, like you like the
Law & Order and that you flirted with every guy in the Tri-State area!"
188,Monica," Chandler! (Joey and his grandmother shush them and wave them away, which
they do.) Okay, let me get this straight, it's okay for you to flirt, but not for me."
189,Chandler," Oh, I'm so glad we cleared that up. Look, I'm sorry, some things are
different for men and for women."
190,Monica," Go on, teach me something about men and women."
191,Chandler," Okay, I've already taught you so much already, but whatever. See when
you flirt with a guy you think, ""I'm just flirting, no big deal."" But the guy is
thinking, ""Finally! Somebody who wants to sleep with me!"""
192,Monica, No way!
193,Chandler, It's true.
194,Monica, Well that's pathetic!
195,Chandler, Again true.
196,Monica, And this goes for all guys?
197,Chandler," All guys that are awake. Then we go to sleep and then all the guys
from the other end of the world wake up and behave the exact same way."
198,Joey," (To Ross in the kitchen) All right, it's another commercial; I still
haven't told her!"
199,Ross," Joey! This is like the last commercial. You've got like (checks his watch)
ten minutes left!"
200,Joey," I know, I know! What am I going to do? (Thinks) Ooh!"
201,Monica, No! You are not gonna run out and leave her here!
202,Joey," (dejected) Yeah, all right. (Thinks of something.) Ooh! (He quickly runs
out before anyone can stop him.)"
204,Chandler," Uh, Joey is gonna be right back. Right back! (Tries to pantomime it
for her.) Meanwhile, let's-let's-let's talk about you. (Pause.) So, you're old and small."
206,Rachel, (entering) (To Phoebe) (whispering) Hey!
207,Phoebe, Did you find it?
208,Rachel," The earring? No. But look, I found my sunglasses under the couch! I've
been looking for these since like last summer. (Puts 'em on.)"
209,Phoebe," Okay, those are my sunglasses, you borrowed them from me."
210,Rachel," Okay, calm down, here they are. (Gives back the sunglasses.)"
211,Monica," (entering from her room) Phoebe! (Motions for the earrings. Phoebe gives
her the one-minute sign.)"
212,Phoebe, (To Rachel) What are we going to do?!
213,Rachel," I don't know, I don't know."
214,Phoebe," All right well, we're just gonna have to tell Monica, that's all."
215,Rachel," Oh gosh, she's going to kill me."
216,Phoebe, I suppose I could tell her it's just all my fault.
217,Rachel, Ohh that'd be great!
218,Phoebe," Mon, can I talk to you for a sec?"
219,Monica," Yeah, what is it?"
220,Phoebe," Umm, I lost one of your earrings. I'm sorry! I am so, so sorry!"
221,Monica," (shocked) Wow! All right well, I mean, what can you do? If you lost it
you lost it."
222,Phoebe," I will replace it, I promise. I feel so terrible."
223,Monica," All right, sweetie that's fine. You didn't do it on purpose."
224,Phoebe, No. 
225,Monica, Look at you! Come here! (They hug.) Feel better?
226,Phoebe, Yeah! You're the best!
227,Rachel," Okay, wait a minute. Wait a minute, I-I-I, I can't do this. Listen
honey, this is, it's not Phoebe's fault. She lent me the earrings, and I lost it.
I'm so sorry. Honey, I feel terrible too. (Holds out her arms for a hug.)"
228,Monica," (angrily) That is exactly why I do not lend you stuff!! (Rachel
looks over at Phoebe in resignation.) Okay?! I mean, first it's my jewelry! And if it's
not my jewelry, it's-it's my blue sweater! And if it's not my sweater, it's my sunglasses!"
229,Rachel, Your sunglasses?!
230,Monica, Yes!
231,Phoebe," Oh, right! (Hands Monica back her sunglasses.)"
233,Ross," (running to the door) Oh, mine! Mine! Mine! (to everyone) Okay, here goes.
Prepare yourselves for some Class A flirting."
234,Chandler," Okay, hold on. (Pauses as he readies himself.) Okay. (Walks away.)"
235,Rachel," Honey, you have nothing to prove. And if you really like this girl, I
don't flirting is the right thing to… (Ross interrupts and shushes her.)"
236,Ross," You'll see. Okay. (Readies himself.) Oh, what's-what's her name?"
239,Ross," (He opens the door while faking a laugh.) Hey! Oh, we-we can't keep eating
like this. (Monica turns her head in shame.)"
241,Ross," Okay, (gets the money) so, do you make the pizzas in one of those uh,
wood-burning ovens?"
243,Ross, Gas? Wow! Intense.
244,Chandler," (To Monica) If this is the way all the Gellers flirt, we don't have a
problem."
245,Ross," (to Caitlin) Hey uh, y'know that smell gas has?"
247,Ross, They put that in.
249,Ross," The gas is odorless, but they add the smell so you know when there's a
leak."
251,Ross, A lot of other gas smells…
252,Chandler, Oh the humanity.
253,Ross, Meth-methane smells…
255,Ross, Oh but I-I-I haven't paid you yet!
258,Ross, (To All) Was I talking to her about gas?
259,Chandler, More so than anything else.
260,Phoebe, I-I-I found it interesting.
261,Rachel, I'm sorry.
262,Ross," Look, no-no, hey, hey, don't worry about it! In nine years, she and I will
be right there. (Goes and sits on the couch dejectedly.)"
263,Rachel," Okay, well, I'm gonna clear out some of these boxes. (She grabs a couple
of the old pizza boxes and exits.)"
264,Phoebe, (walking over to Ross) Ross?
265,Ross, Yeah?
266,Phoebe, What else do they add smell too?
268,Rachel," Hey! Hey! (Stops Caitlin) Hi! Hey-hey-hey, I'm Rachel! From upstairs?
The ones with all the pizza?"
270,Rachel," No. No. Every thing's--they're fine. Great pizza. But it's uh, actually
umm my friend Ross. He uh, just gets really nervous when he's flirting."
272,Rachel, Yeah.
274,Rachel," I know, I know, but uh just, I'm telling you, once, once you get past
that part, that where it-it just feels like you wanna die, he's-he's really a good person."
276,Rachel," Yeah. I'm-I'm telling you he's really sweet and he's really funny and
he's just ugh, got a good heart. And besides, I y'know, I think he really likes you."
278,Rachel," Well y'know, we have 7 people and like 10 pizzas, what do you think?"
281,Rachel," (entering) Hey Ross? Umm, I just ran into Caitlin in the hallway and-and
uh, you must be getting better at this flirting stuff than I thought."
282,Ross, What do you mean?
283,Rachel," Well, I don't get it, but she wanted me to give you her phone number.
(Hands him the slip of paper with the phone number on it.)"
284,Ross, And she just gave you this?
285,Rachel, Yeah!
286,Ross," Rach, thanks but uh, I don't need you doing me any favors."
287,Rachel, I-I-I didn't! I didn't! She thought you were cute.
288,Ross, Well that I can believe.
289,Rachel, Yay!
290,Joey, (entering) Hey! Is the show still on?
291,Chandler, Almost over man.
292,Joey," (says hi to his grandma) Look! Oh! (Pointing out the window.) Is that the
Pope?! (Chandler and his grandma turn to look and Joey slips a tape into the VCR.)"
293,Chandler, Why am I looking?
294,Joey," Oh, here I am, here's my big scene!"
296,Joey, (on the tape) All right back off! I gotta gun! I'm not afraid to use it!
298,Joey, That's right!
299,Chandler, You couldn't have at least changed your shirt.
300,Joey," (on the tape) Now, I wanna a suitcase filled with 100,000 dollars. (The
duck quacks, to the duck) Choo! Choo! Choo! (To the imaginary cops) Filled with $100,000
in small bills, and if I don't get it…(the duck quacks louder) Choo!! And if I don't
get it, (pause, picks up the duck) I'm gonna shoot this duck!"
301,Phoebe, Oh no!
302,Joey," (on the tape) I'm comin' out! (He opens the door and hops out pointing the
gun in all directions and then runs out of view.)"
303,Ross, (To Phoebe) And she's supposed to buy this?!
306,Chandler," (singing) Ground control to Major Tom! Commencing
countdown…engines…on!"
308,Joey," (to his grandmother) That's uh, scenes from next week's show. Next week's!"
309,Phoebe, I am definitely gonna watch that!
312,Monica, What about these? These look the same?
313,Phoebe, Definitely!
314,Monica, Not as each other! 
315,Phoebe," Oh, then no."
317,Chandler, (To Monica) Hey!
318,Monica, Hi!
319,Chandler, You ready?
320,Monica, Yeah.
321,Chandler, You look amazing. I'm the luckiest man in the world.
322,Monica," Ohh, you're about to get a little luckier."
323,Chandler, Let me see the earrings.
324,Monica," Oh, honey, the earrings…"
325,Chandler," (looking at them) They look great! Does your boyfriend have the best
taste or what?"
326,Monica, My boyfriend really does have good taste!
328,Chandler, (To Ross) Thanks for picking out the earrings man.
329,Ross, Hm-mmm.
0,Monica," Okay, guys, listen, don't forget that tomorrow is the day that Emily
gets married again, so whatever we do, just try to really keep Ross's mind off of it."
1,Joey," Oh, yeah, good idea."
3,Chandler," Hey man, what's up?"
4,Ross," (sits down at the table) Oh, eh, just thinking about Emily getting married
tomorrow. (Joey panics.) "
5,Joey," Ooh, Ross, look! Look! (Points behind Ross.)"
6,Ross, (turning and looking) What? Where?
7,Joey, Right over there! Right there! Look-look-look!
8,Ross, What am I looking at?
9,Joey, (to the rest of the gang) Somebody help me out here!
10,Phoebe," (entering, with Gary) Hey!"
12,Monica, Hey!
14,Phoebe," Monica, I'm sorry I didn't come by last night. I was out with Gary; he
let me ride around with him in his cop car. We saw and prevented crimes."
15,Joey, You got to go on a ride along?!
16,Phoebe, Uh-huh!
17,Joey, I want to go on a ride along!
18,Ross, Me too!
20,Chandler," Yeah, yeah! Me too!"
22,Chandler, Yeah.
24,Chandler," Well, I like danger."
27,Chandler, Tonight? You-you didn't say it was going to be at nighttime.
30,Rachel, Hey!
31,Monica," Hey! Oh, I'm so glad you're home, I thought tonight we could finally
organize these photos!"
32,Rachel," Ohh, thank God! Finally!"
33,Monica," Okay, I've broken them down into categories. Okay, we have uh, we got
holidays, birthdays, candids, y'know… And then what I've done is I've
cross-referenced them by subject. Right? So if you're looking up, oh let's say birthdays
and dogs, you get Photo 152. See? (Hands her the photo.)"
34,Rachel," Ohh, it's me and La Poo! Wow! I miss that dog."
35,Monica," You can also find him under umm, dog and dead."
36,Rachel, Great! Thanks!
37,Monica," All right, hand me that other box of photos; that's the very last one."
38,Rachel, Okay. 
40,Rachel," Oops. Sorry! Well, good thing you number all of them, huh?"
41,Monica, I hadn't! Photo 152 was a prototype. 
42,Rachel," Ohhhh. Honey, honey, honey, it's okay, it's okay honey. I'm gonna fix
you a drink, huh? Maybe a margarita?"
43,Ross," Ross has the blender! Ugh, everything's just falling apart!"
44,Rachel," No honey, it's okay! Listen, I'll got to Ross's and get the blender, you
get all the margarita stuff ready."
45,Monica," All right, he's keys are in the drawer. Y'know what? I also need some
cash."
46,Rachel," Okay, you want me to stop at the ATM?"
47,Monica," Nah, while you're at Ross's if you see any lying around…"
48,Rachel, What?!
49,Monica," What?! I-I-I don't, I don't do that! "
52,Ross," (to Gary) That was so cool man, the way you leaned on that guy."
53,Chandler, It is starting to get dark out there.
54,Ross, (to Gary) He told you everything! I mean you totally cracked him!
56,Chandler, (laughing) Okay. (Deadpan) But it is officially nighttime.
58,Ross," Oh hey, Gary, want me to grab the berry for ya?"
60,Ross, It's the—Chandler!!
62,Joey," (returning from a deli) Okay, I got it! This place makes the best sandwich
in the world!"
64,Joey," Oh-ho, yeah!"
66,Joey, Yep!
68,Joey," (dejected) Yeah okay. (To Chandler) Even though my tax dollars paid for
this car."
69,Chandler, Your tax dollars?
70,Joey," Yeah, okay."
72,Chandler," (leans in and takes a sniff of Joey's sandwich) Wow! That sandwich
really does smell good."
73,Joey, Did I say you could smell it?!
74,Chandler, I can't smell your sandwich?
75,Joey, Half the taste is in the smell! You-you're sucking up all the tastiness!
76,Chandler," Okay, I'll give them back. (Exhales strongly through his nose and Joey
just glares at him.) Look! What is so great about that sandwich?"
77,Joey," Okay, imagine the best sex you've ever had."
78,Chandler, Okay.
79,Joey, Are you thinking about Monica?
80,Chandler, Yeah.
81,Joey," Yeah, what's that like?"
83,Rachel," Ohh please don't be from a real dinosaur! Please! Please! Please!
Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! (She picks up the 2 pieces and looks at the
stand.) Made in Mexico! Yes!! Ugh, who would buy this?! (Looks for a place to hide it and
finds a wall sconce and drops the pieces into it and heads into the kitchen as the phone
rings.)"
84,Monica, (on the answering machine) Rach! It's me! Pick up!
86,Rachel, Hey! What's up?!
87,Monica," I need a few more things to make the margaritas. Uhh, I need some salt,
some margarita mix, and tequila."
88,Rachel, So all we have is ice?
89,Monica, See if he has ice.
90,Rachel, Okay.
93,Rachel, Oh. Oh! (Takes a slug of tequila.)
95,Ross, So where are we going next?
97,Chandler," Sur-surprise him? We're not, we're not gonna make anybody mad are we?"
98,Joey," Come on man! (To Gary) Listen so uh, are you gonna squeeze the perps shoes
a little bit before he lawyers up?"
100,Ross," Yeah, no one talks like that!"
101,Joey, Oh what? Like your Mr. Cop!
102,Ross," Hey, I'm more cop than you two!"
103,Chandler, How do you figure that?
104,Ross," Hello! I'm in the front seat, okay? I'm Gary's partner!"
105,Chandler," Y'know, when you say partner it doesn't sound cop. It, it sounds gay."
106,Ross," Umm, jealous! (He drops the cherry and it turns on.)"
108,Ross," Yeah, no problem. (Tries to turn it off.)"
110,Ross," Sorry! Sorry! Oh, (He sticks it under his shirt) there! (It's just there
flashing through his shirt) Hey Gary, who am I? Phone home!"
113,Chandler, Look at Officer Ross riding back here with the visitors.
114,Joey," Yeah, what's up with that Serpico?"
117,Monica, (does Rachel's) Nooo!
118,Rachel, (does Monica's) I know!
119,Monica," Well thank God you were here! I mean, we have to erase that!"
120,Rachel, What?! We can't do that!
121,Monica," We have too! I mean what if Ross's hears that and then calls her back
and then they get back together? Is that what you want? Ross back with that controlling,
neurotic, crazy Emily? The Emily that wouldn't let him see you?"
122,Rachel," Noo! Oh no! No! God no! He should not get back together with her. I know
that! You know that! Even Ross knows that! But that still doesn’t give us the right
to erase his message!"
123,Monica," I'm his sister, okay? I love him! I don't want to see him get hurt! Come
on! Doesn’t that give me the right to control him—help him?"
124,Rachel, I don't think he's the one who needs help.
126,Monica," No, look, she's obviously unstable, okay? I mean she's thinking about
running out on her wedding day. (Rachel slowly turns and glares at her.) (Realizing what
she just said.) Okay, fine! But I mean, look at the position she's putting him in! What's
he gonna do? Ross is gonna run over there on the wedding day and break up the marriage?! I
mean, who would do that?! (Rachel again turns and glares at her in disgust.) Okay, fine,
all right, but that's y'know, it's different! Although it did involve a lot of the same
people."
127,Rachel, Ugh!
128,Monica," Y'know what, this is obviously some kind of twisted joke she's trying to
play on him."
129,Rachel," Okay, you are crazy! I'm sorry, but she sounded generally upset!
I mean, listen! (She hits a button on the machine.)"
131,Rachel, Noooooooo!
133,Chandler," Okay, y'know, we-we're safe right? I mean nothing bad can go down!"
135,Ross, What is it?
137,Chandler," (deadpan) Oh, hurry up. I want to sign that."
139,Ross, What? What? What? What is it?
140,Joey, Is everything okay?
141,Chandler, What's going on?
145,Joey, (To Ross) You okay man?
146,Ross, Uh-huh. Thank Joey!
147,Chandler," Uh, HELLO!!"
148,Joey, Hi.
151,Monica," All right, I guess we should go."
152,Rachel," No, wait. Wait."
153,Monica, Oh yeah right! (She grabs the money and shoves into her pocket.)
154,Rachel," No, Monica! Monica! We have to fix this!"
155,Monica, There's nothing we can do. You erased the message!
156,Rachel, Yeah well unless we tell him.
157,Monica," Well, if you're gonna be totally rational about this, I can't argue with
you! All right? Fine, if you wanna tell him, tell him. I just don't want to be a part of
it."
159,Rachel," Oh, maybe that's Emily calling back to leave the exact same message."
160,Ross," (on the machine) Hey Ross! It's you! I just want you to remember this
feeling. You are lucky to be alive! So live everyday to the fullest. Love yourself, okay?
Okay. Oh, and also get stamps. Bye! (He hangs up.)"
161,Monica, Wow! Play that message for Emily and this whole problem goes away!
162,Rachel, Right?
165,Phoebe, (excited) John Glenn is here?!
167,Ross," Pheebs, we had the most incredible night! Okay, so, we're in the
car…"
169,Phoebe, Hi!
171,Ross," Okay, okay, so we're in the car. Right? And bang! A shot was fired.
And Joey with no regard for his own safety throws himself on me!"
172,Phoebe," My God, Joey!"
173,Chandler, (pouting) It was a car backfire!
174,Ross," Yeah, but-but he didn't know that!"
175,Joey," Yeah, I didn't know that."
176,Ross, And it could've just as easily have been a bullet.
178,Chandler, Who jumps at loud noises!
179,Ross, Wow! I could've died tonight.
180,Chandler," Yeah! If the car that backfired had run over you! Y'know what, I think
I'll go home before Ross starts rambling about his newfound respect for life. (He gets up
and starts for the door.)"
181,Ross, I do have a newfound respect for life.
182,Chandler, (returning) Oh my God! (Storms out.)
184,Phoebe," Yeah! Sure! Yep! (Gets up) Oh, y'know what? If I heard a shot right now,
I'd throw my body on you."
186,Phoebe, Okay!
188,Phoebe, Bye!
191,Joey," Cut it out Ross! I hate to have to save your life and kick your ass in the
same day!"
193,Joey, Dude! How come you took off? 
194,Chandler," Oh, I just went for a walk, around the living room. Whatever…"
195,Joey, Is something wrong?
196,Chandler," No. No I'm just tired. Y'know, from-from the walk."
197,Joey, Okay.
198,Chandler, You dove in front of Ross! Ross!
199,Joey," That's what this is about! Oh my God, you hate Ross!"
200,Chandler, I do not hate Ross!
201,Joey," Of course you do! I saved him! You're mad at me! It all adds up! You want
Ross out of the picture."
202,Chandler, What picture?
203,Joey," I don't know, but I don't like what I'm hearing!"
204,Chandler," Look I'm very glad that you saved Ross from the car backfire, but
y'know, it could've been a bullet and you y'know, you didn't try to save me!"
205,Joey," Ohh, you're upset because you think I chose Ross over you! No!
I…knew…you could take care of yourself. Y'know, I mean Ross, he need help. He's
not street like us!"
206,Chandler," When it comes down to it, you would risk your life for Ross before you
would for me. That's the bottom line."
207,Joey," Well, no, not exactly! All right, look, I, I wasn't trying to save Ross.
Okay? My sandwich was next to Ross. All right? I was, I was trying to save my sandwich."
208,Chandler, From a bullet!
209,Joey, I know it doesn't make much sense…
210,Chandler, Much sense?!
211,Joey," Look Chandler, it was instinct! Okay? I just went for it!"
212,Chandler," So you risked your life, for a sandwich!"
213,Joey," I know it sounds crazy, but Chandler this is (Goes and picks up the
sandwich) the greatest sandwich in the world!"
214,Chandler," So you didn't uh, choose Ross before me."
215,Joey, No! I would never do that! You-you're like my brother!
216,Chandler, Really?!
217,Joey," Yeah! In fact, to prove how much you mean to me, (He unwraps the sandwich
and holds it out for Chandler) here."
218,Chandler, Thanks. (He grabs the sandwich.)
219,Joey," No, eh, oh-oi, easy, it's not a hot dog!"
221,Joey, How good is that?
222,Chandler," (with his mouthful) Oh-oi-ho, yeah!"
223,Joey, See?
224,Chandler, Hm-hmm. (Goes to take another bite.)
225,Joey," Oh-whoa-hey, dude, what are you doing?!"
226,Chandler, I thought you were showing me how much you mean to me.
227,Joey, Yeah. With a bite! (Takes back the sandwich.) Gee-e-e-eez!
229,Rachel, Hey! Hi!
230,Ross," Rach, what uh, what are you doing here?"
231,Rachel," Hey! Y'know what? You are in our apartment all the time! Okay?
This is, this is just a drop in the bucket mister!"
232,Ross," Y'know, it-it doesn't matter. The important thing is that you're here.
You're my friend, and you're here. Oh! (He goes over and hugs her.)"
233,Rachel," Okay, just a little scared. What's going on Ross?"
234,Ross," The most amazing thing happened tonight. I thought my number was up. I had
an actual near death experience!"
235,Rachel, What?! What? What happened?!
236,Ross," Okay, okay, we were on the ride along with Gary, right? "
237,Rachel, Yeah!
238,Ross, And somebody took a shot at me!
239,Rachel, (gasps) Really?!
240,Ross," No, a car backfired, but (Rachel suddenly calms down) I thought somebody
was taking a shot at me. And Rach, I…I survived! And I was filled with this-this
great respect for life. Y'know? I-I want to experience every moment. I want to seize every
opportunity. I-I am seeing everything so-so clearly now."
241,Rachel, Because a car backfired?
242,Ross," (stares at her briefly) Okay, why are you here?"
243,Rachel," Well, I-I-I don't know how this fits into your whole ""seizing""
thing but um, Emily called you today."
244,Ross, You talked to her?
245,Rachel," No, she left a message. (He starts for the machine.) (Stopping him.) But
it-it kinda got erased. There's just (Pause) something wrong with your machine."
246,Ross," Well, okay, what-what did she say?"
247,Rachel," Well, uh something about having second thoughts about the wedding and
did you guys make a mistake breaking up and uh, she wants you to call her."
248,Ross, Wow!
249,Rachel," Now, that-that was a good thing that I told you, right?"
250,Ross," Huh? Yeah! Yes, of course!"
251,Rachel," Okay. Thank you! Thank you! Because—I'm sorry, all right. Because
y'know what? She didn't want me—not important. The point is, I was right. Your
decision. Okay? I was right. (She starts for the door.) (Stops) Your decision."
252,Ross," Right. I guess, I guess I should call Emily."
253,Rachel," Okay, no, that's not the right decision. That's not, that's not right,
no Ross-Ross, come on! I mean, that woman made you miserable! Okay, Ross, do you really
want to get back into that?"
254,Ross," Okay, look, yesterday I would've even considered calling her back, but my
ex-wife calls on the same day I have a near death experience. I mean, that-that has got to
mean something!"
255,Rachel," Ugh, Ross! That was not a near death experience! That was barely
an experience!"
256,Ross," You weren't there! Okay, maybe this is something that I-I'm supposed to
seize! Y'know?"
257,Rachel," Okay, y'know what? Maybe, this is not about seizing stuff. Maybe this is
about escaping stuff."
258,Ross, Huh.
259,Rachel," I mean, look-look today you escaped (Pause) (Not believing it) death,
y'know? And maybe this is a chance for you to escape getting back together with
Emily?"
260,Ross," That does make sense. Because I do wanna seize some opportunity, but I-I
really don't wanna see or talk to her."
261,Rachel," Well, there you go!"
262,Ross," Yeah. Maybe today is just, close call day."
263,Rachel, (laughing) Close call day.
264,Ross," Hey, thanks Rach. (They hug.)"
265,Rachel," Ohh, honey no problem. Okay. (Gets up.)"
266,Ross, Oh wait-wait-wait! The message is blinking. Maybe you didn't erase it. 
267,Rachel, Oh?
269,Ross," (on machine) ""Hey Ross, it's you!"" (Hits the stop button) Oh
yeah, no that's-that's an old message, nobody needs to hear that."
270,Rachel, No. (She heads for the door again.)
271,Ross," (looking at the coffee table where his money was) Hey umm, was-was Monica
here?"
272,Rachel, Yeah.
273,Ross," Yeah, I want my money back."
274,Rachel," (going out the door) Yeah, uh you-you probably need that for stamps,
right?"
278,Ross," Hey Pheebs, has Gary ever been shot at for real?"
279,Phoebe," Yes. Once. Yeah, a little. He kinda did it to himself. It's not really a
good story."
280,Ross," I wonder how I would react under fire, y'know? And not backfire but-but
heavy fire, like I was in a war or something."
281,Monica," Man, I would be great in a war! I mean, I really, I think I would make a
fantastic military leader. I mean I know I would make General way before any of you
guys."
282,Chandler, Before or after you were shot by your own troops?
283,Ross," I know where Joey would be. He would be down in the foxhole protecting all
of us."
284,Chandler," Yes, if the foxhole was lined with sandwiches."
285,Joey," Yeah, hero sandwiches. (Points at Ross who points back.)"
286,Phoebe," Well you all know that I'm a pacifist so I'm not interested in war in
any way. (Gets up) But y'know what? When the revolution comes, I will have to destroy you
all. (Starts to leave.) (To Joey) Not you Joey."
1,Phoebe," I'm fine, thanks."
2,Chandler," (To Monica) Yeah, see, I can't pull of baby-doll can I?"
3,Monica," No. I think we learned that from the sugarlips incident. I'm gonna get
some tea."
4,Chandler, Okay.
6,Chandler, Hiya doin' pumpkin?
7,Phoebe, Nope. (Chandler nods in agreement.)
9,Monica," So it looks like it's going really well for you two, huh?"
11,Monica, (shocked) Oh my God!
13,Monica, I think that is so great! When are you gonna ask her?
15,Monica," I swear, I promise. I promise. Oh my God, I'm so excited! {And I just
can't hide it! I'm about to lose control and I think I like it! Sorry, just
couldn't resist it.} All right, listen let me tell you, do not get her flowers.
Okay? Because y'know, she cries when they die, and there's the whole funeral…"
17,Phoebe, Okay. Bye! 
19,Phoebe," So, what movie should we see?"
20,Monica, (sitting down) Gary's gonna ask you to move in with him!!
21,Phoebe, What?! Really?!
22,Monica," He just told me at the counter. He made me promise not to tell, but I
couldn't hold it in any longer!"
23,Phoebe, I can't believe this!
24,Chandler," (terrified) Right, because it's fast. Because, it's so fast. It's
fast!"
25,Monica, Relax! It's Phoebe! Not you!
26,Chandler," Oh! Good for you Pheebs, way to go! (Breathes a sigh of relief)"
27,Phoebe," No, but it is fast. Isn't it?"
28,Monica, Ohhhh!
29,Phoebe," No, I like him a lot but I don't think I'm ready for this!"
30,Chandler," So, what are you gonna do?"
31,Phoebe, I don't know. I'll just handle it—I'll ask you to talk to him!
32,Chandler, Me?! Why me?
33,Phoebe," Because you are so afraid of commitment! You talk to him, make him
scared like you! Make him a…man!"
34,Chandler," I'll try, but I'm not sure what good it would do, y'know? Because I'm
a lot less afraid of commitment than I used to be."
35,Monica," That is so sweet! (She kisses him and turns to add some sugar to her
tea.)"
36,Chandler," (To Phoebe, behind Monica's back) Still terrified, I'll take care of
it. No problem. (When Monica turns back he smiles and kisses her, when she turns away he
nods that he'll do it to Phoebe.)"
39,Joey," Hey Ross, is uh, is Staten Island really an island?"
40,Ross," Uh-huh, that's why they call it Staten Island."
41,Joey, Ohhh. I thought it was like Long Island.
42,Ross," (he catches the ball and pauses, staring at Joey in disbelief) Also an
island."
44,Joey," Hey, what time is it?"
45,Ross, (looks at his watch) 217.
46,Joey," Wow! You realize that we've been throwing this ball, without dropping it,
for like an hour?"
47,Ross, Are you serious?!
48,Joey," Yeah. I realized it about a half-hour ago but I didn't want to say
anything 'cause I didn't want to jinx it."
49,Ross, Wow! We are pretty good at this! Hey! We totally forgot about lunch!
50,Joey," Oh, I-I, I think that's the first time I ever missed a meal! (Checks his
pants.) Yeah, my pants are a little loose!"
51,Rachel," (entering) Hey, you guys…"
52,Joey, Hey!
53,Rachel, Is Monica here?
55,Rachel," All right listen umm, I just bought something I'm not sure she's gonna
like it, and it's gonna seem a little crazy, but this is something that I wanted since I
was a little girl."
56,Ross, You bought Shawn Cassidy!
57,Rachel," Noo! I wish! Okay, you ready? "
59,Rachel," Okay! (She goes and gets her surprise and when she returns with it, Ross
stares in shock.) Check it out!"
61,Ross, What-what is it?!
62,Joey, What the hell is that?!!
63,Rachel," It's a, it's a cat!"
64,Joey," That, is not a cat! {I have to agree with Joey on this one.}"
65,Rachel, Yes it is!
66,Ross, Why is it inside out?!
67,Rachel," Excuse me! But this is a purebred, show-quality Sphinx cat!"
68,Ross, How much did you pay for that?
69,Rachel," Well, it was a little extravagant, but I a pretty good deal."
70,Ross, Yeah? How much?
71,Rachel, A thousand bucks.
72,Ross, ON A CAT??!!!!
73,Joey, It's not a cat!
74,Rachel," All right listen ball boys! My grandmother had one of these when I was a
little girl and it was the sweetest thing! I mean it was so cute, it would sit in my lap
and purr all day long, and I would drag a shoestring on the ground and he would chase it!"
75,Ross," Free cats do that too, y'know. {Which reminds me, if I might get a little
political here, support your local animal shelter. Pet shops are not the place to
buy dogs and cats from, you get a much better deal from the shelter, plus they probably
won't die on you in a week and a half. If you want a leash, go to the pet shop. If you
want the dog for that leash, go to the shelter and save it's life. Now back to regularly
scheduled programming.}"
76,Joey, It's not a cat!
77,Rachel," Ugh! Look you guys, I'm really excited about this! Okay? I don't care
what you think! I'm gonna go set up a little litter box for Mrs. Whiskerson. (They both
glare at her.) Well, what am I gonna call her? Fluffy?!"
79,Ross," (To Joey) Hey, you wanna get something to eat or uh, do you wanna see how
long we can throw this ball back and forth? Huh?"
80,Joey," Uhh, the ball thing."
81,Ross, Yeah?
82,Joey," Hey Ross, wouldn't it be great if we could go two straight hours without
dropping it?!"
83,Ross," Uhh, yeah it would! Let's do it!"
84,Joey, Okay!
86,Joey, (catches the ball) Uh-oh.
87,Ross, What?
88,Joey, I have to pee. And Rachel's in the bathroom!
90,Joey," Man, I didn't think we were gonna make it!"
91,Ross," I know! (Looks at the ball in his hands.) Don't switch hands, okay?"
93,Chandler, Hey ladies! What are you in here for? (Laughs at his joke.)
95,Chandler," Gary, I'm here to report a crime."
97,Chandler, It is a crime that you and I don't spend more time together.
99,Chandler," Well, I heard that you thinking about asking Phoebe to move in with
you and I thought maybe, we should have a talk. Man to uh, me."
101,Chandler," Uh, are you crazy? Are you insane? If you live with Phoebe, you two
are gonna be y'know, live-living together!"
103,Chandler, You mean scared.
105,Chandler, Scared? Happy?
107,Chandler," I am trying to open your eyes, my man! Don't you see, if you lived
with Phoebe she's always gonna be there. You're gonna get home, she's there. You go to
bed, she's there. You wake up and oh yes, she's there!"
109,Chandler," Were you're parents happy, or something?"
111,Chandler," Wow, y'know when you say it, it doesn't sound so scary."
113,Chandler," Yeah, I think I do! Y'know what? You move in with her! You move in
with her right now! Maybe I should in with Monica!"
115,Chandler," (pause) Yeah, you're right about that."
117,Ross," …now when they found the remains of the Mesozoic Mastodon they
discovered what appeared to be the remains of a Paleozoic Amphibian in its jaws!
How did it get there?!"
119,Joey, Maybe this should be more of a quiet game.
121,Monica, (entering) Hey guys!
122,Joey, Hi!
123,Monica," Joey, I left my watch on the counter last night. (Goes to the counter)
It was right here, where is it?"
124,Joey, I don't know.
125,Monica," All right, come on, I'm-I'm late for work!"
126,Ross, How do you know? You don't have a watch.
127,Monica," Guys, could you please just stop throwing the ball for one minute and
just help me find it!"
128,Joey," Oh, I don't know…. Yeah, can't do it."
130,Monica, What?!
131,Ross," Monica, whatever you do, do not drop that ball!"
132,Joey," Yeah, we haven't dropped it in… (Looks to Ross.)"
133,Ross," 2 hours, 27 minutes."
134,Monica, Really?!
136,Monica," (on phone, faking she's sick) I-I'm not gonna be able to make it into
work today, I don't feel very good. (Joey makes a high throw and Monica has to catch it
way over her head.) (Not sounding sick) Yes!! (Realizes what she just did.) (Sounding sick
again) Wow! Uh, for a second there I thought I was really better, but I'm not. (Hangs up
and keeps throwing the ball.)"
138,Ross, Hey Rach!
139,Rachel, Hey.
140,Ross, Check it out! Almost 3 hours without droppin' it!
141,Rachel," Oh, wow! Congratulations, that's quite a waste of time."
142,Monica, Rach?
143,Rachel, Yeah?
144,Monica," You have scratches all over you, what happened? (Rachel's arms are
covered with scratches.)"
145,Rachel," Well, it's my cat."
146,Monica, (shocked) What?!
147,Rachel," Oh yeah, I got a cat."
148,Monica, I don't want a cat!
149,Joey," Oh, don't worry, it's not a cat."
150,Ross, Yeah.
151,Rachel," You guys this cat is nothing like my grandmother's cat. I mean,
it's not sweet, it's not cute, I even dragged that little string on the ground, and it
just flipped out and scratched the hell out of me. And I swear, I know this sounds crazy,
but every time this cat hisses at me I know it's saying, ""Rachel!"""
152,Ross, Doesn't sound as crazy as paying a thousand dollars for a cat.
153,Monica," (To Rachel) What?! You paid a thousand dollars for a cat when you owe me
300!!"
154,Rachel," Well, I was gonna let you play with it."
156,Chandler, Hi!
157,Phoebe," Hmm, did you talk to Gary about the moving in thing?"
158,Chandler," Yes I did, and I think you should do it."
159,Phoebe, What?!
160,Chandler," He's a great guy, y'know? And he loves you a lot, you are a very lucky
lady."
161,Phoebe," You are useless! Freaking out about commitment is the one thing
you can do! The one thing! And you can't even do that right! God!"
162,Chandler," I’m sorry. (Pause) If you ask me, I'd move in with him."
163,Phoebe," Ohh!! God! (Gary enters and she sees him) Ooh! (To Chandler) Get out of
here, good for nothing."
165,Chandler, Hey Gar!
167,Phoebe, Yeah! Okay. (They move to the couch.)
169,Phoebe, Thanks! Okay. (They sit down.)
171,Phoebe, Yeah?
173,Phoebe, Uh-hmm.
175,Phoebe," No that's not true. If you're not moving forward, you're just staying
still. And staying still is good. Watch this. (She stays still for a brief second.) "
177,Phoebe, Yeah?
179,Phoebe," That is so sweet. But don't you think it's a little too soon? I mean
there's so much we don't know about each other."
181,Phoebe, I just—I don't want us to jump into something we're not ready for.
183,Phoebe," I really don't want to mess up what we have. I'm just—I'm worried
it's gonna be a big mistake."
185,Phoebe, Which is why my answer is yes!
187,Phoebe, Uh-huh! (They hug.) I'm so…happy. (She's not happy.)
190,Ross," (catching the ball) Monica! Stop throwing it so hard! We're on the same
team!"
191,Chandler, Four hours? You guys have been doing this for four hours?
192,Joey, That's right baby.
193,Chandler," All right, let me in. (He jumps off of the counter to join in the
game.)"
194,Monica, (jumping in front of him) No-no! Don't do it! Don't!
195,Chandler, What?
196,Monica, He's a dropper!
197,Joey," Oh yeah, that's right!"
198,Chandler, I'm not a dropper!
199,Ross," It's really a uh-uh three person game, y'know?"
200,Chandler, It's throwing and catching!
201,Ross, All right. (He gently tosses the ball to Chandler who catches it.)
202,Chandler," Oh! Oh! That's so hard. (Starts to juggle the ball, but loses control
and almost drops it and hands it to Monica.)"
204,Joey," Whoa-whoa you guys, it's not a cat!"
205,Monica, Oh my—Oh good God!
206,Rachel," (she's wearing an oven mitt to protect her hand) I give up you guys, I
don't know what I'm going to do with this thing!"
207,Ross," Baking it didn't help, huh?"
208,Monica," So, why don't you just take it back to where you got it?"
209,Rachel, I tried! They won't take her back.
210,Chandler, Maybe that's because she's a minion of the anti-Christ.
211,Monica," Rach, why won't they take it back?"
212,Rachel," Well, they said would but they would only give me store credit. I mean,
what am I going to do, get a thousand regular cats?"
213,Monica," Look, if you want you can keep it at our place until you find out what
to do with it."
214,Rachel," No Mon that's not the point. I'm out a thousand dollars, I'm all
scratched up, and I'm stuck with this stupid cat that looks like a hand! (Storms out.)"
216,Monica," Oh my God, the cat's made my eyes water! Don't-don't throw it to me! My
vision's been compromised!! (Quickly grabs a tissue to wipe her eyes.) Oh God! Okay. Okay.
It's okay. Man, that was close."
217,Chandler," Yeah, you almost overreacted to something."
221,Phoebe, We're moving in together! Isn't it great! Yay!
223,Phoebe," I know, I'm so excited!"
225,Phoebe," Well, you're not more excited than I am! No way! I'm the most
excited!"
227,Phoebe," Okay, yeah, I'll see you later! Don't forget about the moving in!"
230,Monica, So you're moving in with him. What happened?
231,Phoebe," I couldn't tell him no. He got so sad. Maybe it'll be all right. I do
really like him a lot and probably do it eventually anyway and plus, think of all the
money I'll save on stamps."
232,Monica," Why, do you write him a lot?"
233,Phoebe," No, I just heard when people live together, they split the cost of
stamps. Don't they?"
236,Phoebe," Oh, I'm sorry, the oven mitts really freaked me out."
239,Phoebe," No, nothing."
241,Phoebe, Yeah.
243,Phoebe," No, as soon as something opens up we'll move right in. Unless it doesn't
have a pool, I need a pool. (Turns away from him.)"
245,Phoebe, Uh-huh!
248,Phoebe," (sits down) Yeah, I feel great. 'Cause we're moving in together."
250,Phoebe," Yeah, uh-huh, there was nothing. (Pause) Can I get some water?"
252,Phoebe," Umm, yeah! Today's."
254,Phoebe," (looks at the paper) Are these for rent! I thought people were just
bragging!"
256,Phoebe," Yes. Yes! Fine! I am someone! You want me to say it? I have
doubts! (Pause) I'm sorry! (Puts her head down.)"
258,Phoebe, Yeah?
260,Phoebe, That's so sweet.
262,Phoebe, Living with you would make me happy.
264,Phoebe," No, I really wanna live with you! I wanna move in with you!"
266,Phoebe," Yes. Definitely! Yes! Let's live in an apartment that we both live in!
(Hugs him.) "
268,Phoebe," Oh wait, one sec. One sec. (Goes to the mirror) Hey you! Behind the
glass! Who are you looking at! I've always wanted to say that when I was in one of these
rooms, (sees the look on his face) which was never!"
270,Rachel, Show cat! Quality show cat! Show cat! (A woman approaches.)
272,Rachel, It's not a baby! It's a cat!
274,Rachel," Oh no! No! It's actually—it's very sweet. It's very sweet. Look!
(Goes to pet it and it hisses at her.) Yeah, do you want it?"
276,Rachel," Well, so then what are you doing to me? Okay? Just get out of here! All
right? Move on!"
279,Rachel, Yes! Thank you! Exactly! You want it?
281,Rachel," Oh, terrific! That'll be $2,000."
283,Rachel," Okay, a thousand."
285,Rachel," Well, I do, but you're just gonna have to actually look at this as more
of an investment than a cat."
287,Rachel," (makes some unintelligible sound to stop her from leaving) Obviously you
know how to haggle, so I'm not gonna try and take you on. Okay? So $800 and I don't call
the cops because you're robbing me blind! Blind! (Covers her eyes) Just take cat, leave
the money, and run away! Run away! (Uncovers her eyes and sees that the woman has fled)
Damnit! (To the cat) Cat, can't you at least smile or something?! (The cat hisses at her
again, it sounds like Rachel) Okay, did anybody just hear that? Anybody?"
289,Ross, I'm starving! 
290,Monica," Come on guys! Suck it up! We're closing in on ten hours! It's gut-check
time!"
291,Joey," I don't know who made you the boss? All right? We (Ross and him) invented
this game!"
292,Monica, Please! I made this game what it is.
293,Chandler, Not fun anymore?
294,Ross, I'm still hungry! 
295,Monica," All right, there's some pizza at my place, we can all eat with one hand
right? Are you with me?"
296,Ross, I am!
297,Monica," All right! Let's go! (Runs to the door.) Let's go Team Monica! (The guys
all stop and stare at her) All right, we can work out the name later."
299,Monica, Rachel! What is your cat doing in one of my bowls!
300,Rachel," It's not! I'm defrosting a chicken. (Pause) Oh, I uh sold Mrs.
Whiskerson."
301,Ross," Oh, thank God!"
302,Joey, Did you get your money back?
303,Rachel," Yeah, 15 hundred dollars."
304,Monica, Wow! You made a profit!
306,Rachel," Oh yeah, there you go. (Hands over the pillow.)"
308,Rachel," Oh good, great! I'll-I'll keep that in mind. (Turns and walks away.)"
312,Phoebe," I like waking up with you too. (Looks out the window) Oh! It's such a
beautiful morning. (Some birds are singing outside the window) Oh, I can stay here all
day."
314,Phoebe, We could have breakfast in bed…
316,Phoebe, Okay. (He grabs his gun and shoots the bird.) Oh! Oh no.
318,Monica," All right! Come on Monica! Look alive! Come on, look alive!"
319,Phoebe," (entering) Oh good, you're all up."
320,Rachel, Phoebe! It's 6 o'clock in the morning! Why aren't you at Gary's?
321,Phoebe," Oh yeah, that's over."
323,Chandler," Come on! Gary's such a great guy! Whatever the problem is, you can
work it out!"
324,Phoebe, He shot a bird!
325,Chandler, Oh that is over!
327,Rachel," Phoebe, are you okay?"
328,Phoebe," Yeah. Yeah, I'll be alright."
329,Joey," Oh hey, here Pheebs. (He throws her the ball.)"
330,Phoebe," (catches it) Nah, I don't feel like playing. (She sets the ball down on
the table and everyone gasps.)"
331,Monica," It's okay. It's okay. Just pretend that it didn't happen! Okay? No one
needs to know! I mean, Phoebe's not an official ballplayer! I mean, only official
ballplayers can drop the ball!"
333,Rachel," Phoebe, honey, wanna get some breakfast?"
334,Phoebe, Yeah!
335,Monica," Okay! Okay, let's race! First one there wins! Ha-ha! (Runs out the door
and everyone watches her leave.)"
337,Chandler, You guys wanna eat here?
341,Joey," Man that was great! Huh? Can you believe how long we threw that ball
around?"
342,Rachel," Yeah, it is amazing it lasted that long."
343,Ross, I know. My arm is killing me.
344,Rachel," No, I meant with the dropper over here. (Points at Chandler.)"
345,Chandler," Y'know, how did I get this reputation as a dropper? Okay? I'm anything
but a dropper. (We see various scenes of him dropping a football, a mug of coffee, the
phone, an apple, a Frisbee, a record, and the final scene has a ball bouncing off of his
chest. I'm not going to describe them, you'll have to see them.)"
0,Ross, What's going on?
1,Rachel," Well, my eye is a little itchy."
3,Joey," Uhhh, mine too! Yeah."
4,Monica, (To Rachel) Wow! It's really red! You should go see my eye doctor.
5,Rachel, Richard? I'm not gonna go see your ex-boyfriend!
6,Chandler," Oh, Richard. That's all I ever hear, Richard, Richard, Richard!"
7,Monica," Since we've been going out, I think I've mentioned his name twice!"
8,Chandler," Okay, so Richard, Richard!"
9,Monica, It's not Richard! Okay? It's this new guy and he's really good.
10,Rachel," Well, I'm sorry I'm not going to an eye doctor!"
11,Ross," Oh God, here we go!"
12,Chandler, What?
13,Ross," Anytime anything comes close to touching her eye or anyone else's she like
freaks out. Watch! Watch! (He takes his finger and moves it towards his eye.)"
14,Rachel," (flinches) Ross! Come on! That's all right! Fine--Okay, I have a weird
thing about my eye. Can we not talk about it please?"
16,Monica," Hey Rach, remember that great song, Me, Myself, and I? (And on
the ""I"" part she mimics poking her eye.)"
17,Rachel, (flinches again) Monica! Come on!
18,Ross," Hey, does anybody want to get some lunch? All those in favor say I? (Pokes
his eye)"
19,Rachel, (freaks) Ross! Stop it! Come on!
20,Chandler," How much did I love The King and I? (Oh, you get the
point by now.)"
21,Rachel, Chandler!
22,Joey," Me too! Me too! Me too! (Yeah, he does the same thing.) "
23,Rachel, Just stop it! Come on!
25,Chandler, You okay there man?
26,Joey," Yeah, I got too excited!"
29,Ross," All right, I gotta go. I'm taking Ben to the park."
30,Phoebe," Ohh, give him a kiss for me!"
31,Ross," All right, bye!"
32,Monica, Bye!
33,Phoebe, Bye!
34,Ross, Later! (Exits.)
35,Phoebe," (after he's gone) I am so sorry you got caught in the middle of that. I
didn't mean to be so out there. I am furious with him!"
36,Chandler," Wow umm, calm down."
37,Phoebe," I'm trying, but man that guy can push my buttons!"
38,Monica, Why are so mad at him?
39,Phoebe," Look, I don't wanna talk about it. Okay?"
40,Monica," Well, it just seems that…"
41,Phoebe," You wanna be on my list too? Keep talking! Has anyone seem my list by
the way?"
42,Chandler," Uh, no Pheebs. What's it look like?"
43,Phoebe," Uh, it's a piece of paper and it says, ""Ross"" on it."
44,Joey," (entering, depressed) Hey. I just got off the phone with Estelle and guess
what. (Pause, then very excitedly) I GOT THE LEAD IN A MOVIE!!!!!!"
45,Chandler, You got the lead in a movie? That's amazing! What's the movie about?!
46,Joey," It's called Shutter Speed, it's really cool! Yeah, umm, I meet this girl
in the subway and we fall in love in like a day, right? And then, she
disappears… But I find out where she lives and when I get there this like old lady
answers the door and I say, ""Where's Betsy?"" Right? And she says, ""Betsy's
been dead for 10 years."""
47,Phoebe," Ohh-oh, chilling!"
48,Joey," And the best part is, we're filming in the desert outside Vegas! (To
Chandler) And you know what that means buddy!"
49,Chandler," Yeah, I know that means buddy!"
50,Joey," Road trip! Yeah, we can rent a car! I just have to be there by Tuesday!"
51,Phoebe," Oh wait, my grandmother's dead."
52,Chandler," Well, uh, we can talk about that too Pheebs."
53,Phoebe," No! No, her cab! She probably won't be using it; you can drive it to Las
Vegas."
54,Joey, All right! Thanks Pheebs!
55,Chandler," Whoa-whoa-whoa, what are we going to do about my job?"
56,Joey," Oh umm, not go."
57,Chandler," All right, great, road trip baby! (To Monica) This okay with you?"
58,Monica, Chandler! You don't have to ask for my permission. (Quietly) You can go.
59,Chandler, Thank you.
60,Monica," Hey Rach, come on! We're gonna be late for the eye doctor appointment!"
61,Rachel," (entering from her bedroom) All right! Let's get this over with! Ugh!
(She walks by the table and notices that no one is looking and accidentally on purpose
knocks over the open cereal box.) Ohhh! No! Look what I did! (She starts walking through
the mess. {Also, notice the continuity error in this scene. Note the position of the box
and dispersal pattern of the cereal before and after the camera cut.}) Oh, I mean, look at
this mess! I mean, we're probably gonna have to clean this up! Y'know? We're gonna have to
reschedule!"
62,Monica," No. If you thought this mess is going to bother me, you are wrong! All
right, let's go Blinky! (She ushers Rachel out the door, but before the door fully closes
she sticks her head back in.) Chandler!!!! (Chandler agrees to clean up the mess.)"
64,Phoebe, Oh hey Joey! What's up?
65,Joey," I can't decide which route to take to Vegas. Hey, you've traveled a lot
right?"
66,Phoebe," Yeah, I've been around."
67,Joey," Okay, so-so which route should I take the northern route or the southern
route?"
68,Phoebe," Ooh, if you take the northern route there's a man in Illinois with a
beard of bees. {Okay, I must protest this, I've lived in Illinois all my life and know of
no man with a beard of bees! Wisconsin, on the other hand, might be a different story.}"
69,Joey, Great! Problem solved!
70,Phoebe, But on the southern route there's a chicken that plays tic-tac-toe.
71,Joey," Well, back to square one."
72,Phoebe," Oh, I know a way that you can decide! All right, I'm going to ask you a
series of questions and you answer as quickly as you can."
73,Joey, (quickly) Yes!
74,Phoebe," Good, but wait. Okay, all right, here we go. Now I want you to relax.
Take a deep breath. Clear your mind. (Quickly) Which do you like better peanut butter or
egg whites?"
75,Joey, Peanut butter!
76,Phoebe, Which would you rather be a fireman or a swimmer?
77,Joey, A swimmer!
78,Phoebe, Who would you rather sleep with Monica or Rachel?
79,Joey," Monica. Oh… huh, I always thought it would be Rachel."
80,Phoebe, No thinking! No thinking! Tie or ascot?
81,Joey, Ascot!
82,Phoebe, North route or south route?
83,Joey, North route!
84,Phoebe, Bamn! There you go! Huh?
85,Joey," Wow! That was incredible! Beard of bees, here I come!"
86,Ross, (entering) Hey!
87,Phoebe," Oh, this guy again. (She ignores him.)"
88,Joey," Hey man, what's up?"
89,Ross," Uhh, not much. You guys want to see a movie tonight?"
90,Joey," Sure, what do you want to see?"
91,Ross," I don't know, umm…"
92,Joey," Oh, I know how we can decide. Phoebe, show him your game!"
93,Phoebe," Umm, no thank you. (She gets up and moves to the couch. They were at a
table previously.)"
94,Ross, What's with her?
95,Joey," I don't know. But hey, I know we can decide. Okay, I'm gonna ask you
questions and you answer real quick. Okay?"
96,Ross, Okay.
97,Joey, What do you like better action or comedy?
98,Ross, Action.
99,Joey, Who would you rather sleep with Monica or Rachel? 
101,Ross," Dude, you are sick."
102,Joey," Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot you had that whole Rachel thing."
104,Rachel, Oh my God! What does that thing do?
105,Monica, (looks at it more closely) Oh that's an eye removal machine.
106,Rachel," All right, I'm outta here!"
107,Monica, I'm kidding! I'm kidding!
110,Rachel, Hey!
112,Rachel, So were done then!
114,Rachel, Okay.
116,Rachel, Uh-huh.
118,Rachel, Okay.
120,Rachel, (jerks back from the tester) What?!
121,Monica," A small puff of air, now come on!"
123,Rachel, All right.
125,Rachel," I'm sorry. All right, I'll just stay in here this time. (Puts her head
back.) Okay."
127,Rachel, Uh-huh.
129,Monica," Y'know what, I'm gonna hold her head."
130,Rachel, Okay.
132,Monica, Okay. (Monica backs off.)
133,Rachel, Okay. Okay!
135,Rachel," (really excited) Great!! It was very, very nice to meet you sir--Ow!
Hey! What are you doing?! Are you crazy! (He took out that thing they use to look at
people's retinas and looked at Rachel's when she was shaking his hand causing her to
flinch and scream at him.)"
137,Rachel," Yeah, no, I don't-I don't put things in my eye."
139,Rachel, Great!
141,Rachel," Okay, just give me the damn drops! (Grabs them and storms out.)"
142,Monica," Dr. Miller? (She covers her right eye and reads from the chart) P E C F
D."
144,Monica," I sure do! (She runs over to a drawer, opens it, and grabs a lollipop.)
(To Rachel) And you don't get one!"
146,Rachel," Y'know, I-I gotta tell ya, those eye drops are a miracle. My eye is a
100% better."
147,Monica, They're still in my coat.
148,Rachel, Damn!
149,Chandler, (entering) Hey!
150,Joey, Hey! You ready to go?
151,Chandler," Yeah, listen, how cold is it going to be there? Do I need a coat or
will all these sweater vests be enough? (Holds up 3 of them in different colors.)"
153,Chandler, What?
154,Monica, I love you.
156,Joey," Man, I wish Ross was coming with us! Y'know? I'm gonna miss him!"
157,Phoebe, Thanks a lot! I just got that jerk out of my mind!
158,Chandler," Hey, so where are we staying? Is the movie putting us up in a big
hotel suite?"
159,Joey," Uh no, not really. It's an independent film y'know? So we don't have a
real big budget. I figured I'd just stay in your room."
160,Chandler," I see, but once you get your first paycheck you'll be springing a big
hotel suite, right? I mean, lead in a movie, they must be paying you a lot?"
161,Joey," Oh yeah! For every dollar Shutter Speed makes, one penny of it goes right
in Joey's pocket."
162,Chandler, So you don't get paid unless the movie makes money?
163,Joey," Did you not hear the plot of the movie? ""She's been dead for ten
years."" I'm gonna be a millionaire!"
164,Ross, (entering) Hey!
165,Joey, Hey!
166,Ross," I just wanna say good-bye to you guys and to see if you guys will
place a little bet for me, huh? Twenty bucks on black 15."
167,Joey, You got it!
168,Ross, All right!
170,Chandler," All right, bye-bye now!"
171,Phoebe, Bye!
172,Rachel, Bye you guys!
173,Joey, Bye-bye!
174,Monica, I wanna say good-bye at the car!
175,Chandler, Okay!
176,Joey, Anybody want to say good-bye to me at the car?
177,Rachel," Oh honey, I'll say good-bye to you at the car if you don't mind the
puss."
179,Joey, See ya! (Walks out.)
180,Rachel," Well, wait a minute! The puss is good! It means it's healing! (Runs
after him.)"
181,Ross," Hey Pheebs, what 'cha reading? (Phoebe ignores him) Pheebs? (Turns away)
Hello? (He sits down next to her and she moves over a bit.) Phoebe? (He moves closer and
she keeps moving away.) Phoe-Phoebe! (They end up hanging over the arm rest.) Come on! (He
grabs the magazine away from her.)"
182,Phoebe," Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't see you there."
183,Ross," Phoebe, are you, are you mad at me, or something? 'Cause if are please,
tell me what it is I did!"
184,Phoebe," Well, if you don't know I can't help you."
185,Ross," Well, I don't know."
186,Phoebe," Well, I can't help you."
187,Ross," Well, whatever it is I'm-I'm very, very sorry. Okay?"
188,Phoebe, Apology accepted.
189,Ross," Okay. So we're, we're good?"
190,Phoebe, Uh-huh.
191,Ross," All right. (Gets up.) I'll uh, I'll see you later, okay?"
192,Phoebe," (quietly) Bye, fat ass. "
193,Ross," ALL RIGHT!! Phoebe now come on! Will you please tell me what it is I did
that mad you so mad at me!"
194,Phoebe, I don't know! I don't remember!
195,Ross," Well if you can't remember, can't we just forget about this?"
196,Phoebe," Oh no, I am mad at you. I know that much. But, I am sorry about the fat
ass thing. You actually have a very sweet little hiney. "
199,Joey," Man, I'm getting pretty tired. You're might have to take over soon."
200,Chandler," We've been driving for a half-hour, and you haven't looked at the road
once."
201,Joey," Don't worry, it's out there! (Just then a horn honks and Joey quickly
looks at the road.) I think I just need lunch."
202,Chandler, Yeah.
203,Joey, You wanna eat? (Pulls out the twenty) My treat!
204,Chandler, Isn't that Ross's money?
205,Joey, Yeah. Okay. Ross's treat! Where do you wanna eat?
206,Chandler, I don't know.
207,Joey," Ooh, hey, I know how we can decide! All right, uh, I'm gonna ask you a
bunch of questions and then you have to answer real fast. Okay? So uh, clear your mind
Clear it right out! Clear it out! Clear!"
208,Chandler, Okay!
209,Joey," Okay, uhh, would you rather be too wet or too dry?"
210,Chandler, Too dry.
211,Joey," Do you believe in ghosts, yes or no?"
212,Chandler, No!
213,Joey, Is this movie gonna be my big break?
214,Chandler, No!
215,Joey, (shocked) What?!
216,Chandler, Yes.
217,Joey," Dude you said, ""No!"""
218,Chandler," I also said, ""Yes!"""
219,Joey, You don't think this is going to be a big break for me?
220,Chandler, No! (Realizes) Ahhh!!!
221,Joey, I don't believe this!
222,Chandler," Look Joe, I just, I just don't want to get your hopes up real high."
223,Joey, What are you talking about?! I'm the lead in a movie!
224,Chandler, They're not even paying ya! This doesn't even sound like a real movie!
225,Joey," Y'know what? I don't need this! Okay? I don't know why you're dumping all
over my big break."
226,Chandler," Joe, I don't think this is going to be your big break."
227,Joey," Is that why you're on this trip, huh? Make me feel like a loser? 'Cause if
it is, I'll tell ya, I-I-I'd rather be alone."
228,Chandler," Oh, you don't want me on the trip?"
229,Joey, Not if you're gonna be like this!
230,Chandler," All right, I'll tell ya what, the next time you ask me a question like
that I'll lie."
231,Joey, Yeah! I don't want you on the trip!
232,Chandler," All right, fine! Fine! Why don't you pull over? I'll get out right
now!"
233,Joey," Fine! (He slams on the brakes, stopping the car on the bridge to the sound
of numerous car horns.) Get out!"
234,Chandler, You're not actually supposed to stop on the bridge.
235,Joey, Get out!!
236,Chandler," All right!! (Gets out and Joey speeds away.) Wait! Wait, there's no
sidewalk! Yeah, I'm gonna die here."
239,Ross," Okay, are you mad at me because my hair gel smells?"
240,Phoebe, No.
241,Ross, Are you angry at me because I said your handwriting is childlike?
242,Phoebe, No that made me feel precious.
243,Monica," Oh, I know! Umm, is it because he's always correcting people's grammar?
Whom! Whom! Sometimes it's who!"
244,Ross, Yeah? Sometimes it's… (Does the fist thing.)
245,Rachel," Oh, did you beat him at a board game? He turns into such a baby when he
starts to lose."
246,Ross," Okay, I'm the baby. (Points at his eye.)"
247,Rachel, Eh! Stop it!
248,Chandler, (entering) Hey!
249,Monica, Chandler! What are you doing here?
250,Ross, Hey!
251,Chandler, Joey kicked me out of the car on the George Washington bridge!
253,Chandler," I don't know! He went crazy! Y'know, we were playing that game where
you-you ask a question and you answer it really fast."
254,Phoebe, That game should not be played without my supervision. 
255,Chandler," Well, I don't know what mad him so mad, y'know? All I said was that
uh, I didn't think this wasn't gonna be his big break, that this movie wasn't going to do
anything for him, and that uh, y'know it didn't sound like a real movie--Okay, he
should've pushed me off of the bridge."
256,Phoebe, What's in the bag?
257,Chandler," Oh, I figured you guys would all be mad at me. So I got you some gifts
that I found on the side of the road. (Looks into the bag.) Who wants the teddy bear with
one leg?"
258,Phoebe, I do!
260,Rachel," Okay. (She tilts her head back and squeezes the eyedropper. The only
problem is, it's not over her eye.)"
261,Monica, Not even close.
262,Rachel," Okay, then y'know what? Help me! I need help! I can't do this!"
263,Monica, Okay! All right! Let's do it!
264,Rachel, All right!
265,Monica, Sit down. (They sit down on the couch.)
266,Rachel, All right.
267,Monica, Put your head back.
268,Rachel, Yes!
269,Monica, All right.
270,Rachel, Okay.
271,Monica," Now, open your eyes."
272,Rachel," Okay, they are. (No they're not.)"
273,Monica, How many fingers am I holding up? (She's not holding any up.)
274,Rachel, (thinks) Four.
275,Monica," Oh my God, I was thinking four."
276,Rachel, Really?!
277,Monica," Yes! All right, y'know what? Why don't we start with a practice run?
Okay?"
278,Rachel, Okay!
279,Monica, No drops!
280,Rachel, Great!
281,Monica, Okay.
282,Rachel, Okay.
283,Monica," On three, 1…2…3! (Rachel turns her head on three to avoid the
drops.) Now my pillow's all wet! (She was trying to fool Rachel and squeezed the
eyedropper.)"
284,Rachel," Well, well, you said it was practice!"
285,Monica, Then why did you move?!
286,Rachel, Because I knew you were lying!
287,Monica," All right, come here! (She gets up and drags Rachel off of the couch by
her legs.)"
288,Rachel," (as she's being dragged) What are you? Monica!! Stop it!! Oh my God!
Stop it! (Monica drags her totally onto the floor and on her back.)"
289,Monica," I am going… I'm going--Turn it over! (Rachel rolled onto her
stomach and Monica rolls her back.) I'm… I am going to get these drops in your eyes.
(She is holding Rachel down with both hands and has the eyedropper in her mouth.) "
290,Rachel, Oh my God! You really are freakishly strong!
292,Rachel, Monica! Stop it!
293,Monica, (spitting out the eyedropper) Damn! It's empty!
294,Rachel," Wow, y'know if Joey and Chandler walked in right now, we could make a
fortune! (Monica is straddling Rachel and holding her arms down. In a rather risqué pose,
at least for primetime TV.)"
296,Phoebe," Ooh that is definitely Chandler, Joey, or Ross. (Thinks) Or-or Rachel!"
297,Monica," (answers the phone) Hello? (Listens.) (To Phoebe) It's Joey. (Phoebe's
proud of herself.) (To Joey) I'm so glad you called! Chandler told me what happened.
Y'know he's really upset about it."
298,Joey," (on a pay phone holding a box) Not as upset as he's gonna be when he finds
out what I did with his sweater vests!"
299,Monica, What did you do to his sweater vests?
300,Joey," Let's just say there's a well-dressed pack of dogs in Ohio. Hey Monica
listen is-is Phoebe there? I gotta ask her something about the car."
301,Monica," Yeah, she's here. Hold on a second. (She hands the phone to Phoebe.)"
302,Phoebe," Hey, dude!"
303,Joey," Hey Pheebs! Listen, this wooden box keeps sliding out from under the seat.
What-what is it?"
304,Phoebe," Oh that's my grandma. (Joey holds the box away from him.) And thanks
Joey she's having a really great time. (Joey is happy now.)"
305,Chandler," (who has just entered) Is that Joey? Is that Joey? Let me talk to him!
I wanna talk to him!"
306,Phoebe," Okay Joey? Chandler's here, he was wondering… (We hear the dial
tone as Joey hangs up.) Okay, I guess he ran out of change."
307,Chandler," Y'know, he won't even talk to me. How am I going to apologize to him
if he won't even talk to me?"
308,Monica," Well, maybe you should send him something. So that when he gets to Las
Vegas he'll know that you're sorry."
309,Chandler," That's a good idea. I wonder where I could (Pause) get a basket of
porn…"
310,Phoebe," No, don't-don't say I'm sorry with porn!"
311,Chandler, Really?
312,Phoebe," Y'know what you should send him? A cartoon of cigarettes. 'Cause that
why he could trade it for protection. No. That's prison."
313,Ross," (entering) Okay Pheebs, I know how we're going to figure this out. Okay,
clear your mind and answer the first thing that comes into your head. Okay?"
314,Phoebe, Uh-hmm.
315,Ross, What do you like better flora or fauna?
316,Phoebe, Fauna.
317,Ross, Who would you rather be Simon or Garfunkle?
318,Phoebe, Garfunkle.
319,Ross, Why are you mad at me?
320,Phoebe, You said I was boring--Ohh!
321,Ross, When did I say you were boring?!
322,Phoebe," Oh my God, I remember now! We were playing chess!"
323,Ross, Phoebe! You and I have never played chess!
324,Phoebe," Oh, come on! Yes, remember that time on the frozen lake? We were playing
chess, you said I was boring, and then you took off your energy mask and you were Cameron
Diaz! (Realizes) Okay, there's a chance this may have been a dream."
326,Joey, Hey-hey! Stanley! Hey-hey! You're leading man is here! Let's get to work.
328,Joey, Wh-what?! Why?!
330,Joey, (laughs) You're kidding right?
332,Joey, What?!
334,Joey," Uh, hang out?! How long?"
336,Joey, No!
340,Joey, Yeah.
342,Joey," Thanks. (The grip walks away.) (Reading the card.) Congratulations on your
big break. "
345,Monica, (answering it) Hello?
346,Joey," (on phone from Vegas) Hey Monica, it's Joey!"
347,Monica," Hey Joey! Aww, you remembered even though you're a big star!"
348,Joey," Aw, come on! It'll be years before I forget you!"
349,Monica," Joey, what's it like on a movie set, huh? Do you have a dressing room?
Do you have a chair with your name on it?"
350,Joey," Uh, well yeah-yeah, I've got all of that going on. Yeah, listen uh, I want
you to make sure you tell Chandler that he couldn't have been more wrong! Uh-oh! I gotta
go Monica, my uh, my sushi's here! "
352,Joey, (to the family) Sorry about that. Thanks for waitin'.
354,Joey," Everybody smile! (The picture is taken) Okay, thanks a lot! Enjoy your
stay at Caesar's! We hope it's toga-rrific! (The family leaves.) Kill me. Kill me
now."
357,Ross," Hey Rach, can you pass me the TV Guide?"
358,Rachel, Yep!
360,Monica, Go!!
362,Rachel, What?!! Stop it! Stop it! Oh my God!
363,Monica," Okay! Okay! Okay! (She succeeds in getting the eye drops in and everyone
climbs off of Rachel.) We'll see you in about 3 to 4 hours."
364,Rachel, Oh! (She's trying to recover while still on the floor.)
0,Rachel, Pheebs? Could you get that? Please?
1,Phoebe, Why? Just 'cause you're too lazy to get up off your touchie? 
2,Rachel," No! No! It's just that all the people in the entire world that I
want to talk to are right here."
3,Phoebe, (smiles) Okay! (Goes to answer the phone.)
4,Rachel, (under her breath) Sucker!
5,Phoebe, (answering the phone) Hello? (Listens) Hey Joey!
7,Joey," Hey Pheebs! Listen, uh can you do me a favor? I forgot the pin number to
my ATM card can, can you get it for me?"
8,Phoebe, Sure! Where is it?
9,Joey," Uh, I scratched it on the ATM machine down on the corner."
10,Phoebe, Ohh! So you're 5639?!
11,Joey, That's it! Thanks Pheebs!
13,Chandler, (entering) Hey!
14,Phoebe," (to Joey) Ooh, do you want to talk to Chandler?"
15,Chandler, (To Phoebe) Is that Joey?! (She nods yes) Let me talk to him!
17,Joey," No! (She nods no to Chandler) Because he didn't believe in my movie! Which
is a big mistake because it is real! Real!"
20,Phoebe, Who was that?
21,Joey," Uhh, my stunt double. Yeah, and y'know, he's getting a little too familiar
for my tastes."
22,Chandler," (To Phoebe) Y'know what? I have been trying to apologize to him all
week! If he's not gonna let me do it on the phone, I'm gonna go down there and do it in
person."
24,Joey," Uhh Pheebs, I heard that. Can you put him on?"
26,Phoebe, Yeah! (She hands the phone to Chandler.)
27,Chandler, (To Joey) Hey!
29,Joey, Don't come out here!
31,Chandler," No-no-no-no, I've supported you one hundred percent and I want to
prove that to you in person!"
33,Joey, I got that! I forgive ya! Don't come out here!
35,Chandler, Forgive me? You haven't been taking my calls in a week!
37,Joey," Well, I'm totally over it Chandler. Friends forever! Don't come out here!"
40,Chandler," Uh, what was that?"
42,Joey," Uh, Entertainment Tonight. [Cut to Chandler] Yeah, okay so, good
talking to ya and don't come out here. All right. (Hangs up the phone and poses for that
picture.)"
45,Phoebe," Monica! I'm sorry I'm late! (Starts looking around for her) Monica?
(Goes into Monica's bedroom.)"
46,Monica," (entering) Phoebe? (Phoebe comes back into the living room) Oh, Phoebe,
I'm so sorry. Have you been here long?"
47,Phoebe, (saddened) It's okay. What the hell took you so long?
48,Monica," Okay, you can not tell Chandler. Okay? That I ran into Richard."
49,Phoebe, Which Richard?
50,Monica, The Richard.
51,Phoebe, Richard Simmons?! Oh my God!
52,Monica," Noo! My ex-boyfriend Richard! Y'know the tall guy, moustache? "
53,Phoebe," Oh! Okay, that actually makes more sense. So how was it?"
54,Monica," It was, it was really nice. We started talking and I-I ended up having
lunch with him."
55,Phoebe, That is so weird! I had a dream that you'd have lunch with Richard.
56,Monica, Really?
57,Phoebe," But again, Simmons. Go on."
58,Monica," The strange part was, he was really nice, umm and he looks great, but I
didn't feel anything at all!"
59,Phoebe, Ooh! So now why can't we tell Chandler?
60,Monica," Because it would totally freak him out and tomorrow's our anniversary. I
just don't want anything to spoil that."
61,Phoebe," Oh, I can't believe you guys lasted a whole year!"
62,Monica, I know.
63,Phoebe, Wow! I owe Rachel 20 bucks!
64,Monica, What?
65,Phoebe, On a totally different bet.
66,Chandler, (entering) Hey!
67,Monica, It's almost our anniversary!
68,Chandler," I know. Can you believe it? One year ago today I was just your
annoying friend Chandler."
69,Phoebe, Awww! Now you're just my annoying friend Chandler.
70,Chandler, Huh.
71,Monica, I got you a present!
72,Chandler," Oh, but it's not 'til tomorrow!"
73,Monica," I know, but you have to open it today! (Hands it too him.)"
74,Chandler, Okay.
76,Monica," (grabbing the gift from him and opening it) Okay! There you go! It's two
tickets to Vegas!"
77,Chandler, Wow!
78,Monica," For this weekend! Oh gosh, it would be perfect, we get to see Joey plus
we get to start our anniversary celebration on the plane. We can call it out
plane-aversary."
79,Chandler, Do we have to?
80,Monica, No.
81,Chandler," Okay this is great, but Joey said he didn't want any of us out there."
82,Monica," Oh, he just doesn't want us to go through any trouble. Think of how
excited he'll be when we go out and surprise him! Plus we get to have our own,
ani-Vegas-ary! A-Nevadaversary!"
83,Chandler," Yeah, I think we should see other people."
84,Monica," But we can go, right?"
85,Chandler, Yes.
86,Monica, Okay!
87,Chandler, It's a great idea. (They kiss)
88,Phoebe," Okay, I'm gonna go too!"
89,Chandler," Y'know Pheebs, it's kinda our (His and Monica's) anniversary."
90,Phoebe," Oh please, you are not gonna ditch again like you did with London."
91,Monica," Ditch you? Phoebe, you were pregnant with the triplets!"
92,Phoebe," Uh-huh, great story! I'm going!"
93,Rachel, (entering with Ross) Hi!
94,Phoebe, Hey!
95,Ross, Hey!
96,Phoebe," Hey, you guys, listen, this weekend we're all gonna go to Las Vegas to
surprise Joey! Including me!! You wanna go?!"
97,Rachel," Well, I guess I could take a couple days off work."
98,Phoebe," Of course you can take a couple days off work because this trip includes
me!"
99,Rachel," Oh no, wait a minute, wait, I've got a presentation tomorrow. I can't
miss that."
100,Ross," Oh, but I've got tickets to the Van Gogh exhibit! I've been waiting like a
year for this."
101,Chandler, (coughing) Art lover!
102,Ross, What'd you say?
103,Chandler, I said art lover.
104,Ross, Is that supposed to be an insult?
105,Chandler," I don't know, I'm very tired. "
106,Ross," So Rach, maybe you and I could fly out together Saturday."
107,Rachel, That sounds great.
108,Ross, Yeah? All right I'll call the airlines. (Picks up the phone and does so)
109,Rachel," Okay. Yeah, that would be nice actually, to have the apartment to myself
for a night."
110,Phoebe," Oh yeah, so you can walk around naked."
111,Rachel, No! So I can be by myself. Y'know? Have a little alone time.
112,Phoebe, Naked alone time.
113,Rachel," No! Phoebe just because I'm alone doesn’t mean I wanna walk around
naked. I mean, you live alone, you don't walk around naked."
114,Phoebe, Uh-huh! Why do you think it takes me so long to answer the door?
116,Phoebe," So, so far is this trip to Vegas better or worse than the trip to
London?"
117,Chandler, So it's pretty much the same Pheebs.
118,Phoebe," Okay, what about after I give you these candies? (Hands them each one
from her purse.)"
119,Chandler," Yeah, I guess it's a little better now."
120,Phoebe," Ah-ha! Okay, (takes out a notepad) Las Vegas 1, London 0! I'll be right
back. (Gets up and heads aft.)"
121,Chandler, (To Monica) Happy plane-aversary.
122,Monica, Aww! I love you!
123,Chandler, Can I give you a present now?
124,Monica, Okay!
125,Chandler," Okay! (He grabs his carryon and starts rummaging through it.) Oh man!
Don’t tell me I did this!"
126,Monica," I love the ""I forgot the present"" fake out!"
127,Chandler," How do you feel about the, ""I really did forgot the present,
please forgive me"" not fake out?"
128,Monica," Oh that's okay. Don’t worry about it, you can give it to me when we
get back."
129,Chandler," Ohh that's the worse thing that can happen on an anniversary
ever!"
130,Phoebe," (sitting down) Oh good! All right, so you decided to tell him about the
Richard thing."
131,Chandler, What-what Richard thing?
132,Phoebe, Oh no. [The patented version.]
133,Chandler, What Richard thing?
134,Phoebe, (To Monica under her breath) Simmons! Go with Simmons!
135,Monica," Okay, I umm, I ran into Richard yesterday and he asked me if I wanted to
go for a bite and I did. The only reason I didn't tell you is because I knew you'd get mad
and I didn't want to spoil our anniversary."
136,Chandler, (talking out of the side of his mouth) I'm not mad.
137,Monica, Really?!
138,Chandler," Oh yeah! Yeah, so you-you bumped into Richard! You grabbed a bite!
It's no big deal. (He still ain't happy.)"
139,Monica, Great!
141,Phoebe," Okay, London 1…"
143,Rachel," (takes off her robe) Oh! Look what happened! {Don't get your hopes up
guys, we only get to see her from the back or from the neck up. Its times like these I
wish that the networks would broadcast some nudity other than Denis Franz's butt.} (In her
head.) Huh, check me out! I'm in my kitchen…naked! I'm picking up an orange. (Does
so) I'm naked! (Goes into the living room) Lighting the candles, naked, and
carefully. (She backs anything that might have a point like a candle on her body
away.)"
145,Ross," (in his head) Oh my God! That's Rachel naked! I can't look at that! I
am looking at this. (Looks back at his book.) Okay, vivid colors, expressive brush
strokes—Unless she wants me to be looking at that. She knows I'm home. She
knows I can see her. What kind of game is she playing? I think maybe someone's lonely
tonight. Oh-ho, Dr. Geller! Stop it! You're being silly! Or, am I?"
147,Rachel," (singing) Love to love ya baby! Ow! Love to love ya baby! Ow!
(There's a knock on the door, she turns off the music, puts on her robe, and goes to
answer the door.) Love to love ya, baby! (There's another knock.) Darnit! (Looks
through the peephole and turns on the lights.) Ugh. (She opens the door to Ross who's
leaning against the door jam.) "
148,Ross, Hey.
151,Ross, May I come in?
152,Rachel," Uh, yeah, if you want too."
153,Ross, Do you want me too?
154,Rachel," Yeah, sure?"
155,Ross," So do I. (Slowly walks in.) Okay Rach, before anything happens (He takes
off his coat) I just want to lay down a couple of ground rules. (Turns back to face her.)
This is just about tonight. I don't to go through with this if it's going to raise the
question of ""Us."" (Rachel's confused) Okay? I just want this to be (Kicks off
his left shoe) about what it is! (Kicks off the other one.)"
156,Rachel," And um, what-what is that Ross?"
157,Ross, The physical act of love. (Hisses at her.)
158,Rachel, (laughs) What?! Are you crazy?
159,Ross," Oh so-so you weren't trying to entice me just now with your-your
nakedness?"
160,Rachel," (gasps) Oh God, you saw me?! Oh!"
161,Ross, You weren't trying to entice me with your nakedness.
162,Rachel," Noo!! No! You thought, you actually thought I wanted to have sex with
you?!"
163,Ross," No! No! (Grabs his coat) No! (Grabs a shoe.) No-no-no-no. (Grabs the other
one and heads for the door.)"
164,Rachel," Ohh wow! I’m sorry, but Ross you kicked off your shoes!"
165,Ross," Can we, can we just forget this ever happened?"
166,Rachel," Yes of course, absolutely! You're right. I'm sorry."
167,Ross, Thank you.
168,Rachel, Yes.
169,Ross," All right I guess I'm, gonna go pack. (Starts to leave)"
170,Rachel," Okay. Oh wait! One more thing umm, do-do we still need to uh settle the
question of ""us?"""
173,Phoebe," Hey you guys wait! Guys! (Catches up to them.) This place is so much
better than London! Okay? This lady dressed like Cleopatra gave me a coupon, 99 cent steak
and lobster dinner. Huh!"
174,Monica," Phoebe, you don't eat animals. "
175,Phoebe," For 99 cents, I'd eat you. (Sees the casino) Okay, I can totally settle
down here. It's got everything I could ever want, including Joey! Look! (Points to Joey in
his gladiator suit posing for a picture with two old ladies.) Oh! Look! Hi!"
176,Chandler, Oh my God.
177,Phoebe," Hey! Joey! (They all head over to him, he spots them coming and panics.)
Hey! Hey!! Wow! (She hugs him.)"
178,Joey, Hi!
179,Chandler, Love your condoms my man.
180,Joey, What-what are you guys doing here? I thought I told you not to come.
181,Phoebe, Why are you dressed as a gladiator?
182,Joey," Uhh, because I'm shooting a scene right now. Yeah, I uh, I play a
gladiator. Uh, y'know what? Hold-hold on a second. (To no one in particular) Can we cut?
Yeah, my-my friends are here, I'm gonna take a little break."
183,Monica, Who are you talking too?
184,Joey," They uh director. Uhh, her. (Points to an old woman standing behind him.
Who glares at him and walks off.) All right, all right, it's not a gladiator movie. I work
here."
185,Chandler, Why?! What happened?!
186,Joey," Well, the movie got shutdown because they ran out of money, so I'm working
here 'til it starts up again, if it ever does."
187,Monica, I'm so sorry.
188,Joey," Look, I'm sorry I didn't tell ya. (To Chandler) I'm sorry man."
189,Chandler," No-no, that's okay, apparently there's a new policy where we don't
have to share everything with everybody."
190,Monica, I knew you were not okay with that.
191,Phoebe, So you're a gladiator! Wow!
192,Joey," Yeah, what-what's going on?"
193,Phoebe, Monica had lunch with Richard.
194,Joey, Dawson?! 
195,Phoebe, Noo! But that would've been so cool!
196,Chandler, No! Her boyfriend Richard!
197,Monica," It meant nothing! Okay? After all this time, how can you not
trust me?"
198,Chandler," When you go lunching with hunky moustache men and don't tell me about
it!"
199,Monica, You're right. I'm sorry. I should've told you.
200,Chandler, Thanks. (They hug.)
201,Joey," Aww, there we go."
202,Phoebe, I love Vegas!
203,Monica," I promise you, next time I will absolutely tell you."
204,Chandler, (pushing her away from another hug) Next time?
205,Joey," Ooh, so close."
206,Chandler, There's not gonna be a next time! You can not ever see him again!
207,Monica," I can not see him? I mean, you can't tell me what to do!"
208,Chandler," That's so funny, because I think I just did!"
209,Monica," Oh y'know what? If you're gonna be acting like this all night, I really,
I don't even want to be around you."
210,Chandler, Fine with me!
211,Monica, Fine! Happy Anniversary!
212,Joey," Whoa! Whoa! Guys! Please! Come on! Come on! This is obviously just a big
misunderstanding."
213,Monica, No it is not!
214,Chandler, What are you talking…
215,Joey, Hey-hey don't look at me! I just work here! (Walks away.)
217,Rachel," (taking off her sweater) Okay umm, Ross? I'm-I'm really warm, so I'm
going to be taking off my sweater. Now, I'm just letting you know that this is not
an invitation to the physical act of love."
218,Ross, (sarcastic) Yep! That's hilarious!
219,Rachel, I'm sorry. I'm done. I'm done.
220,Ross," Y'know, last night was embarrassing for you too."
221,Rachel," No, not really. I mean you've seen me naked hundreds of times."
222,Ross, Uh-huh. But it was a first for the rest of my building.
223,Rachel," Okay. All right, that's true! But y'know I just don't embarrass that
easily."
224,Ross, What?! You totally get embarrassed!
225,Rachel," No, I don't! Ross, I think I'm just a more secure person than you are."
226,Ross, Is that so?
227,Rachel, Yeah.
229,Ross," (loudly so that everyone can hear) Hey lady! I don't care how much you
want it! Okay?! I am not gonna to have sex with you in the bathroom! (Rachel
sinks lower on her chair trying to hide.)"
231,Joey," Hey, y'know in Roman times this was more than just a hat."
232,Chandler, Really?
233,Joey," Yeah, sure! Sure! They would uh, they would scrub the floors with it! They
would use it to get the mud off their shoe. And sometimes underneath the horse would get
dirty so they would stick it right…"
234,Chandler," (interrupting in the nick of time) Joey, I uh! I can't believe
this is how I'm spending my anniversary."
235,Joey," All right well, I'll take you someplace nice then. Look! A guy tipped me a
hundred bucks today."
236,Chandler, Whoa!
237,Joey," Yeah-yeah, he was playing blackjack for like an hour and he won $5,000.
Can you believe that? $5,000!"
238,Chandler," Y'know, if I won $5,000 I'd join a gym, y'know build up my upper body
and hit Richard from behind with a stick! (Mimics it.)"
239,Joey," Wait a minute! Why don't I do what that guy did? I'll take this $100 and
turn it into $5,000! And then I'll turn that into enough money to get my movie
going again!"
240,Chandler, Good luck! 
241,Joey, Chandler! I don't need luck. I have thought this through!
242,Chandler, I see.
246,Monica, (to the bartender) Thank you.
247,Phoebe, Thanks.
248,Monica, I can't believe this! This is like the worst night ever!
249,Phoebe," Y'know Monica you had a minor setback in your relationship with
Chandler. Big deal! It's only Chandler. (Monica turns and stares at her.) I am so
sorry."
250,Monica," This is crazy! I mean, it's such a stupid argument. I don't even wanna
see Richard again."
251,Phoebe," So go fix it! Go find Chandler! He's probably up in your room! Tell him
that you're sorry and that you love him."
252,Monica," Y'know what? You're right Phoebe. You're right. Thank you! (Gets up to
find Chandler.)"
253,Phoebe," Sure! (When Monica gets close to the door.) (Yelling) Yeah! Las Vegas,
number one!"
255,Monica," Anybody lose this? (Holds up the chip and the woman next to her shakes
her head no.)"
257,Monica, Hmm.
260,Rachel," Yeah, all right. All right! Just keep walkin'! All right?"
262,Rachel," Ross! What are you… I'm sorry sir. I just, I think he just really
likes you."
264,Ross," (to the guy in the window seat next to him) Hey! Y'know that teacher who
had a baby with her student? (He points at Rachel.)"
266,Ross, What the? What…
267,Rachel," (to the flight attendant who appears in record time. It was only seconds
after Rachel pushed the call button was she there. Once again, more proof that TV isn't
real, IRL she would've been waiting for the rest of the flight and by then Ross's pants
would be dry.) Hi! "
269,Rachel," Yes, I'm sorry. Do you have any extra pants? Umm, my friend seems to
have had a little accident."
271,Joey, (to the dealer) Can I change a hundred? (He hands him his chip.)
273,Joey, (betting all 100) Let's ride.
275,Joey," Hit me! (He does so.) Ohh man! (Joey busts and loses all the money, but
when the dealer starts to collect the cards Joey notices something.) Wait! (He holds his
hand next to the dealer's hand.)"
277,Joey," Chandler! You are not gonna believe this! I have found my identical
hand twin!"
278,Chandler, (totally confused) What?
279,Joey, My identical hand twin!
280,Chandler, What's an identical hand twin?
281,Joey," What's it sound like? It's a guy with my identical hands! It was
incredible! Chandler, the dealer's hands were exactly like me! It-it was like looking at
my hands in a mirror!"
282,Chandler, Are you sure you weren't (pause) looking at your hands in a mirror?
283,Joey," Don’t you see what this means?! I can forget about that stupid movie.
I'm gonna be a millionaire!"
284,Chandler, (totally confused) How?
285,Joey," Look, I don't have it all worked out yet, but it's gotta mean big money!
Come on! Identical hands!"
286,Chandler," Again I must go back to, how?"
287,Joey," This is Vegas man! People will pay to see freaky stuff! Okay, how much
would you pay to see this hand (Holds up his left hand) twice? Huh?"
288,Chandler," (Pause) Y'know, I-I can't really put a price on that Joe."
289,Joey," Hey, are you unsupporting me again?"
290,Chandler," No! No! I support you 100%! I just didn't, I didn't get it right away.
Y'know now I'm caught up! Identical hand twins! It's a million-dollar idea!"
292,Phoebe, Hey!
293,Joey, Pheebs!!
294,Phoebe, Yeah?
295,Joey, I found my identical hand twin!
296,Phoebe," Ohh, you are so lucky! (To Chandler) Hey! So, where's Monica? Did
you guys make up?"
297,Chandler, No!
298,Phoebe, But she just came up here!
299,Chandler, That was Joey!
300,Phoebe, I wonder where she is. That is so weird.
301,Chandler," Yeah, well, she's probably talking to Richard."
302,Phoebe," Would you stop that! Do you wanna know the first thing she said when she
came back from her lunch with Richard? She didn't feel anything for him. She loves you!"
303,Chandler, Really?
304,Phoebe," Yes! Now, she feels terrible! She really wants to make up! You gotta
find her."
305,Chandler, Okay. (He gets up and goes to find her.)
306,Phoebe," Good. (After he leaves, she puts on Joey's gladiator helmet and checks
herself out in the mirror) I should really start wearing hats!"
312,Rachel," Yes, I did. Thank you very much, it was excellent. (Disembarks)"
314,Ross," Ohh, it was the best!"
317,Ross, I think the check in is that way. (Points)
318,Rachel, Ahh.
320,Rachel," Hello! (She makes a face and the kid laughs harder. Finally, his parents
drag him off.) Ohh, kids love me."
321,Phoebe, (sees Ross and Rachel) Hey!
322,Ross, Phoebe! (They hug.) 
323,Phoebe, You guys are here! Yay!
324,Rachel, Hi! (Hugs Phoebe)
325,Phoebe," (sees Rachel's face) What? Did you go to a costume party? Let me guess
umm Pancho Vila? (Points at Rachel) and you're Bob Saget. (An old lady has sat down at the
slot machine Phoebe was just at.)"
326,Rachel, Pancho Vila?
327,Phoebe," Yeah! (Motions to her face, indicating all of Rachel's
""make-up."")"
328,Rachel," What are you talking about Pheebs? (Takes out her compact) I don't…
(She gasps when she looks in the mirror and sees her face.) (To Ross) Oh my God, you drew
on me?!"
329,Ross," Hey, you wet my pants!"
330,Phoebe," Whoa, what kind of party was this?"
331,Rachel," Ross, I have been walking around like this since the plane! I
can—you have so crossed a line. (Heads for the bathroom)"
332,Ross," Rach! Wait! The men's room is that way. (Points in the other direction.
Rachel hits him with her purse and heads for the ladies room.)"
334,Phoebe, Ugh!
335,Ross, What?
336,Phoebe, That's like the third time that lady's won on a machine I was playing.
337,Ross," Oooohhh, I'll bet she's one of those people."
338,Phoebe, M-M-Mole people?
339,Ross," What? No-no, a lurker."
340,Phoebe, Oh. What's a lurker?
341,Ross," Okay when you're playing a machine and it hasn't paid out, a lurker waits
for you to give up and then…"
342,Phoebe, Kills you?
343,Ross, No. They swoop in and steal your jackpot.
344,Phoebe, Ohhh!
345,Ross, Uh-hmm.
346,Phoebe, How do you know about this?
347,Ross," My nana used to do it. That's how she paid for all my dance—karate
lessons."
348,Phoebe, Dance karate?
349,Ross," Yes, it's a deadly but beautiful sport. (Does a karate chop, then does a
little dance-type sway.)"
350,Rachel," (returning with her purse covering her face) All right, it won't
come off!"
351,Ross, What?!
352,Rachel, It won't come off!
353,Ross," Oh my God! Rach-Rach, are-are-are you sure?"
354,Rachel," No, actually I took it off then I drew it back on."
355,Joey, (entering) Hey-hey-hey you made it!
356,Ross, Joey!!
357,Joey, All right! Hey-hey!
358,Rachel, Hi!!
359,Joey," Who's your friend? He's hot! (Ross laughs and Rachel smacks him with her
purse.)"
360,Ross, (To Joey) Thanks man.
361,Rachel, Hi. (She hugs Joey.)
362,Ross," Hey listen I uh, talked to Chandler, sorry about the movie."
363,Joey," No, don't be sorry. I don't need it anymore. I found my identical hand
twin!"
364,Ross, Your what?
365,Joey," My identical hand twin! The person whose hands are exactly like mine! This
thing is a gold mine!"
366,Ross, What?! That's not gonna make you any money!
367,Joey," Okay. Well, if that's how you feel about it, fine! None of you get to live
with me in my great big hand-shaped mansion! Except uh, you Pheebs. You can live in the
thumb."
369,Monica," All right baby, come on! (Rolls the dice) Yes! Yes! I am on fire!"
370,Chandler, (walking by with his luggage) See you later Mon.
371,Monica," Wait Chandler, what are you doing?!"
372,Chandler, What does it look like? I'm going home.
373,Monica," What? Wait! Why? (He turns and heads for the door and she chases after
him.) Chandler! Chandler! Wait! I’m sorry, I was just playing for one second! I was
trying to find you to tell you that, look if you don't want me to see Richard again, I
won't! He means nothing to me!"
374,Chandler," Come on! I was there! (He's propped up with his hand on a statute of a
naked guy. He winces and pulls his hand away.) I know he's the love of your life."
375,Monica, Not any more.
376,Chandler, Really?!
377,Monica," Really! (They hug and kiss) All right? Let's forget about this going
home stuff and celebrate our anniversary. (She picks up his suitcase.) Okay, this is
empty."
378,Chandler," Yeah, I wanted to make a dramatic scene, but I hate packing."
380,Joey," (entering) Uhh, hey. Where's the other guy?"
382,Joey," He's kinda tall, dark hair, hand looks exactly like this. (Holds up his
hand.) See?"
384,Joey," Okay! (Walks away, then turns back.) How you doin'?"
386,Joey, Right! Okay. (Heads for the bathroom.)
388,Ross," (on the phone) Yes, hello. I have a question. Umm, I used your pen to draw
on my friend's face. (Listens) A beard and a moustache. (Listens and laughs) Thank you.
(Rachel turns around and glares at him.) No, she didn't think so. (Listens) I know
it's like (turns and sees Rachel staring at him and quickly changes the subject) anyway,
umm well make-up didn't cover it and we've tried everything to get it off and nothing's
worked. What-what do we do? (Listens) Yeah. (Listens) Uh-huh. (Listens) Yeah. (Listens)
Oh! Okay. (Listens) Okay, thank you! (Rachel gets excited at his tone.) (Hangs up the
phone) Yeah, it's not coming off."
389,Rachel, What?! What else did he say?
390,Ross," Umm, he said he thought I was funny. So…(Rachel stares at him.) Okay,
look-look umm, let's just go downstairs, we'll have some fun, and you will forget all
about it."
391,Rachel," Ross, no! There is no way I am leaving this room looking like
this!"
392,Ross," Oh, come on! Rach, it's-it's not that bad."
393,Rachel," Ross, I am a human doodle!!"
394,Ross," Look, just because some idiot drew on your face doesn't mean you shouldn't
have any fun! Okay? And besides, hey-hey-hey no one is even gonna look at you.
Okay? This is Vegas! Hello! There are tons of other freaks here! (Rachel turns around and
glares at him.) There are tons…of…freaks here. No other. No. Come on! No one
will notice, I swear!"
397,Ross," Okay, there was some staring and pointing."
398,Rachel," Okay, I need a, I need a drink! (Makes a beeline for the mini-bar.)"
399,Ross," Oh, hey y'know, they-they really overcharge you for that stuff. (Rachel
glares at him.) But who cares?! Because it's all on me! (Rachel reaches into the fridge
and pulls out two handfuls of those mini booze bottles.) (Watching her.) That is, one big
drink! "
400,Rachel," (she's finished reliving the fridge of its entire alcohol content.)
Macadamia nut?"
401,Ross, (looking at the price list) Umm… Wow! That's-that's some pricey nut!
402,Rachel, Hm-mmm! (Opens the container)
403,Ross," Really like those Macadamia nuts, huh?"
404,Rachel," Nope! (She puts one in her mouth and spits it out, then does it again in
another direction.)"
406,Phoebe," (seeing her) Get out of here you lurker! (She doesn't move) Go on! Get!
(She throws a quarter at her.)"
407,Chandler, (arm-in-arm with Monica) Hey Pheebs!
408,Phoebe, Ohh! You made up!
409,Monica," Yeah, I couldn't be mad at him for too long."
410,Chandler," Yeah, she couldn't live without the Chan Love. (They start kissing.)"
411,Phoebe," Ohh, get a room."
412,Monica, We have one.
413,Phoebe, I know. Use it.
415,Joey," Oh-oh-oh, yeah! (He grabs some towels and takes them to him.) That's
right, you take good care of those babies!"
417,Joey," It's me, Joey!"
419,Joey, (holds up his hand) Joey!
421,Joey," Okay, so what are we going to do about this hand twin thing?!"
423,Joey," Look, you and I have been given a gift. Okay? We have to do something with
it. Like-like, hand modeling! Huh? Or-or magic! And you know NASA's gonna wanna
talk to us!"
425,Joey," (stopping him) Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa-whoa! We could have our own show!
Y'know we could clap our hands together people will love it! Huh? And-and-and I wrote a
song for us! (Singing, to the tune of This Land is Your Land) This hand is your
hand! This hand is my hand! Oh wait, that's your hand! No wait, it's my hand!"
427,Joey, (following him) But you haven't even heard the chorus!
429,Rachel," Oh my God, I'm starting to look like my great aunt, Muriel."
430,Ross," (gets up) All right. Y'know what? We don’t have to go downstairs! We
can bring Vegas up to us! (He grabs a deck of cards and pulls up a chair.) All right, come
on, come on, we'll play some blackjack. Here we go. (Deals the cards.) 13."
431,Rachel, Hit me!
432,Ross," (does so) Oohh, 23. (Rachel looks at him.) Which is what we play to at
this casino! You win 10 dollars! (Holds out a ten.)"
433,Rachel, I bet 20.
434,Ross, You're right! (Gives her the twenty she won.)
436,Monica," (shaking the dice) A new pair of shoes for the Chan-Chan man! (Rolls the
dice.) Yes!"
437,Chandler, Yes! I've-I've never seen a roll like this in my life!
438,Monica," That's right baby! Okay, what do I want now?"
439,Chandler," Okay, ah umm, ah, a 8. Ah, a 6?"
440,Monica, Pick a number! That is your only job!
441,Chandler, 8. 8!
442,Monica, Thank you!
443,Chandler," If you get this one, we buy everybody here a steak dinner!"
446,Monica, Yes!
448,Monica," (To Chandler) We're not really gonna buy these people steak dinners are
we?"
449,Chandler, Noo!
450,Monica," Okay, good! Okay, what do I want now?"
451,Chandler," Ahh, ooh, try a hard 8."
452,Monica, What?
453,Chandler, Two fours.
454,Monica, Okay. (Rolls the dice) 
457,Chandler," Thank you, Mister Drunken Gambler! Okay, you get this and uh, we get
the biggest suite in the place! (Everyone cheers) Wait-wait-wait-wait! We (motions
to Monica and him.) get the biggest suite in the place."
458,Monica," All right, biggest suite in the place. Come on! (Rolls the dice.)"
459,Chandler," (sees the roll) Yes!! I love you! I can't even remember what we were
fighting about!"
460,Monica," Oh, that's because I had lunch with Rich—Me neither! Okay, what do
I want now?"
461,Chandler, Another hard 8.
462,Monica, Hard 8?! We should call it easy 8!
463,Chandler," Okay, okay, I tell you what. You roll another hard eight; (pause) and
we get married here tonight."
466,Monica, Shut up!! It just got interesting!
469,Monica, What did you just say?
470,Chandler, You roll another hard eight and we get married here tonight.
471,Monica, Are you serious?!
472,Chandler, Yes! I love you! I've never loved anybody as much as I love you.
473,Monica, I've never loved anybody as much as I love you.
474,Chandler," Okay, so if an eight comes up, we take it as a sign and we do it!
{Whoa! Where have I heard that before? Matthew Perry talking about signs in Las Vegas. I
guess it must've been some movie I saw.} What do you say?"
475,Monica, Okay!
476,Chandler, Okay! Come on! Let's go! All right!
478,Chandler, (spots one) Okay! That's a four! And where-where's the other one?
480,Monica," Nobody move! (To Chandler) Okay, you look that way; I'll look this way!"
481,Chandler, All right! 
483,Chandler, Here it is! Here it is!
484,Monica, That could be a four or a five. It's your call.
486,Chandler, It's a four.
487,Monica, I think so too.
490,Phoebe," Oh well, lost again. (She gets up and slowly moves away. The lurker
scurries in and takes her spot, only this time Phoebe set a trap for her and catches her
in the act.) That's it! You and me, outside!"
493,Phoebe," Be cool! (They both pretend to have a nice conversation as the guard
walks by, but after he leaves they both start fighting again.) Okay lady, your lurking
days are over!"
495,Phoebe," Yeah, from now on everyone you lurk, I'm gonna lurk first! You move on
to someone else, I'm gonna be one step ahead of you, every single time! And then I'll be
on your ass every hour of every day 'til Monday, because that's when I go home. When do
you leave?"
497,Phoebe, What time? Maybe we can share a cab!
499,Rachel," Hit me. (He does so.) Hit me. (He does so.) Hit me. (He does so.) Hit
me. (He does so.) Hit me. (He does so.) Hit me. (He does so.) Hit me. (She slows down with
each one.)"
500,Ross, (runs out of cards) We need more cards.
501,Rachel," Yeah, and also we need more umm, drinks. Hold on a second. (Gets up but
stumbles a little bit.) Whup, okay. (She makes it to the phone and picks it up, without
dialing.) Hello! Vegas? Yeah, we would like some more alcohol, and y'know what else? We
would like some more beers. Hello? Ohh, I forgot to dial!"
503,Ross, That must be our alcohol and beers! (Gets up to answer it.) 
504,Joey, Hey!
505,Ross," Ohh, it's Joey! I love Joey! (Hugs him.)"
506,Rachel," Ohh, I love Joey! Joey lives with a duck! (Goes and hugs Joey.)"
507,Joey, Hi!
508,Rachel, Hey!
509,Joey," Look-look-look you guys, I need some help! Okay? Someone is going to have
to convince my hand twin to cooperate!"
510,Ross," I'll do it. Hey, whatever you need me to do, I'm your man. (He starts to
sit down on the bed. There's one problem though, he's about two feet to the left of it.
Needless to say, he misses and falls on his butt.) (Looking up at Joey.) Whoa-oh-whoa! Are
you, are you okay?"
511,Joey," Yeah! I'm fine! Thanks! (He starts to leave, but gets an idea and stops.)
Hey Rach, how you doin'?"
512,Rachel," I'm doin' good, baby. How you doin'?"
513,Joey," Ross, don't let her drink anymore! (Exits)"
514,Ross," Ohh, here's that Macadamia nut!"
515,Rachel, Ohhh!!
516,Ross," (he puts it in his mouth) Nope! Something else. (Throws it back under the
bed.)"
517,Rachel," Oops! All right, so what do you want to do now?"
518,Ross," I wanna get out of the room! Y'know, I…I really miss downstairs."
519,Rachel," Okay, y'know what? There's only one way I'm leaving this hotel room."
521,Ross, Well hello! I'm Ross!
522,Rachel, Good luck to ya!
523,Ross," Excuse me sir, you've got a little something right here. (He points to the
corner of his mouth and they both laugh.)"
525,Rachel, Wow!
526,Ross, (bowing) Hello!
527,Rachel, (bowing) Hello!
531,Phoebe, I won! I won! I finally won!
533,Phoebe, Fine! Here! Take a hike toots! (Gives back her quarter.)
537,Phoebe, (quietly) Sells drugs to kids.
539,Phoebe, She sells drugs to kids. (The guard looks at the lurker.)
542,Phoebe, How about we talk about this over dinner?
544,Phoebe," No! No, you can't arrest me! No!! I won't go back! I won't go back to
that hell hole!!"
546,Phoebe," Oh, okay. (Walks out.)"
548,Monica," Okay, come on, I can't get married until I get something old, something
new, something borrowed, and something blue."
549,Chandler," Okay, all right, all right, all right! Okay! (Picks up a blue
sweater.) Okay, here's something, here's something blue and new."
550,Monica, You're so efficient. I love you! 
551,Chandler, Let's go! (Starts to leave.)
552,Monica, No-no-no! We need something old!
553,Chandler," Ohh, great, I have condom in my wallet I've had since I was twelve."
554,Monica, That'll work!
555,Chandler, I don't think so.
556,Monica," Okay, now we just need something borrowed!"
557,Chandler, (looks around) Here just…take this. (Hands her the sweater.)
558,Monica, That's stealing!
559,Chandler," No, we'll-we'll bring it back! Just put it under your dress."
561,Monica, Ohh. (Rubs her fake stomach.)
562,Chandler," Okay, one thing at a time. (They run out to get married.)"
564,Joey, (sitting down) Ahhh! (Slides his hands across the table.)
566,Joey," No-no, I don't really have any money. Not yet, anyway… (Shakes his
hands.)"
568,Joey," (throws down a small wad of money, and as his hand twin starts to unfold
it, Joey once again brings attention to their special gift to the world. {Y'know, looking
at it now, they really don't have that similar of hands. Joey's are bigger.}) Ooh-ho-ho!
(The dealer stares at him and he stops.)"
569,Phoebe," (entering and sitting down at the table.) Hello. My name is Regina
Phalange. I'm a businesswoman in town on business. Would you like to see my card? (Looks
down) Ooh, what did I do with my file-a-facts? I must've left it in conference room B."
571,Joey, Hit me! (He does so.)
572,Phoebe," Oh my God! May I just say that you two gentlemen have the exact same
hands! They're identical! Now, I've never seen anything like that in the business world."
574,Joey," Uhh, Ms. Phalange, may I ask you a question as an impartial person at-at
this table?"
576,Joey," Wouldn't you pay good money to see these identical hands showcased in some
type of a uh, entertainment venue?"
580,Phoebe," No, you threw out Phoebe. I'm Ms. Regina Phalange. Phalange!"
583,Joey," Me?! Oh come on, man! You can't do this! Come on! (Being dragged out by
the guard) I'm your hand twin!!"
585,Chandler, Hello! One marriage please!
586,Monica," Yep, we wanna get married! "
590,Chandler, (singing) Dum! Dum-dum-dum! Dum! Dum! Dum! Dum-dum-dum!
591,Monica, What are you doing?
592,Chandler," Oh, that's The Wedding March. Does, does that freak you out?"
593,Monica," No, only because that's the graduation song."
595,Chandler," Okay! (Stands up) This is it! (Claps his hands) We're gonna get
married!"
596,Monica, Are you sure you wanna do this?
598,Ross," Well, hello, Mrs. Ross! (Throws some rice.)"
599,Rachel," Well, hello, Mr. Rachel! (Throws some more rice.)"
601,Rachel, Wait! (Gets her bearings) Okay!
0,Chandler,
1,Monica,
3,Ross,
4,Rachel,
6,Rachel,
8,Monica, Whoa!
9,Chandler, Oh my God!
10,Joey, (entering with Phoebe) Come on Pheebs! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!
11,Phoebe, Okay! Okay! Okay! (They run into the chapel.)
13,Chandler, Oh my God!! Is everybody getting married?!!
16,Phoebe," (to her) Hey! Don’t you give me any of your—Hey! (Sees
Chandler and Monica standing there.)"
17,Chandler, Hey!
18,Joey, Hey!
19,Monica, What are you guys doing here?
20,Joey," Ross and Rachel left us a message saying they were getting married!
Isn’t that why you guys are here?"
21,Chandler, Yes! Well that-yes.
22,Monica, Why else would we be here?
23,Joey, Well! What happened?! Did we miss it?
24,Chandler, We actually missed it.
25,Phoebe," Well, maybe you wouldn’t have had you (turns to the attendant) run
in the chapel!"
26,Monica, This is insane!
27,Phoebe," What’s the big deal, y’know? It’s not like it’s a
real marriage."
28,Chandler, What?!
29,Phoebe," Yeah, if you get married in Vegas, you’re only married in Vegas."
30,Monica," What are you talking about? If you get married in Vegas you’re
married everywhere."
31,Phoebe, (shocked) Really?! 
32,Monica, Yeah!
33,Phoebe, Oh my God!—Eh! Well…
37,Rachel," Ohhh! (Looks in the mirror and sees that she still has her mustache and
groans.)"
39,Ross, Why are we in bed together?
40,Rachel, I don’t know. Do-do you have any clothes on?
41,Ross, (checks) Yeah.
42,Rachel, Really?!
43,Ross," No! But we-we didn’t have…sex-uh, did we? I mean, I don’t
remember much about last night, it was such a blur."
44,Rachel, Oh! I remember laughing! I laughed a lot.
45,Ross, And we didn’t have sex. 
47,Rachel," Ohh, I mean, we were really drunk. I’m just glad we didn’t do
anything stupid."
48,Ross," (getting up) Tell me about it. (He sits up on the edge of the bed and has
""Just Married"" written on his back.)"
50,Joey," Mornin’ Pheebs. (Sits down.) Well, my movie has officially been
canceled."
51,Phoebe," Oh Joey, I’m so sorry. You want some of my breakfast?"
52,Joey," Nah, I’m too depressed to eat. I’ll probably eat in like 5
minutes. So I guess I’ll just fly home with you guys, what time’s your flight?"
53,Phoebe, What about my cab?
54,Joey, I don’t need that anymore.
55,Phoebe," No, Joey! You borrowed my cab; you have to drive it back."
56,Joey," I don’t want to drive all the way back by myself, I get so lonely.
(Gets an idea.) Oh—ooh! How about you come with me?"
57,Phoebe," I don’t know, it’s such a long trip."
58,Joey," It’ll be great! We-we could talk, and play games! Huh? This could be
our chance to like renew our friendship."
59,Phoebe, Are you asking me to have a frenaissance?
60,Joey, Sure?
61,Phoebe," All right. Although I don’t think we need one, I never stopped
loving you."
63,Chandler, Hi!
64,Joey, Hey.
65,Monica, Hey.
66,Chandler," So, has anyone talked to Dr. and Mrs. Geller yet?"
67,Phoebe," Um-hmm, yeah. They left me a message; they should be here any minute."
68,Joey, Where is the waitress?! I’m starving!
69,Chandler, It’s a buffet man.
70,Joey," Oh, here’s where I win all my money back! (Gets up and heads for the
buffet table with Chandler in tow.)"
71,Chandler," Listen, I gotta talk to you."
72,Joey," Sure! What’s up? (He grabs a plate and proceeds to load it with a
huge pile of scrambled eggs. Chandler just stares at him and Joey reluctantly gives him a
spoonful.)"
73,Chandler, Monica and I almost got married last night.
74,Joey," Oh my God! That’s huge! (Hugs him.) Wait a minute, why come I
wasn’t invited? And who was going to be your best man? Don’t say,
""Ross."" Do not say, ""Ross."""
75,Chandler," Look, I just don’t think Monica and I are ready to get married
yet! Y’know? I mean, I love her and everything but seeing Ross and Rachel coming out
of that chapel was like a, like a wake-up call that Monica and I are moving so fast.
Y’know? And, how do I tell her without crushing her?"
76,Joey, Oh! Tell her she’s not marriage material.
77,Chandler, What?!
78,Joey," Girls say it to me all the time! And believe me, if she’s anything
like me, she’s just gonna be relieved."
80,Monica," How do I tell Chandler that it’s too soon. It’s gonna break
his heart, he’s not gonna think that I don’t love him anymore."
81,Phoebe, Well you don’t.
82,Monica, Yes I do!
83,Phoebe, Good! Good! I was just testing you.
84,Chandler, (returning with Joey) Hi.
85,Monica," Oh hi! Hi! Y’know, we were just talking about bacon."
86,Phoebe," No, we were talking about tennis. Tennis is more believable. "
88,Ross, Hey!
90,Chandler, Hey!
92,Ross, What?
93,Chandler, Are we gonna talk about what you guys did last night? Or…
94,Rachel," (To Ross) I don’t know. (To the gang.) What do you mean last night?
Nothing, nothing uh, happened last night."
95,Ross, Yeah!
96,Phoebe, Uh-huh! Ross invited us all to watch.
98,Monica, Rach! We weren’t gonna miss our friends getting married!
99,Rachel, (gasps) Who got married?! (Ross is as surprised to hear this as she is.)
100,Chandler, (not quite sure) You did.
101,Ross, What?! Hello! We didn’t get married.
102,Rachel," No, we didn’t get married! That’s ridiculous!"
104,Ross, We-we-we—I remember being in a chapel.
105,Rachel, Oh my God.
106,Ross, I—They would not let us get married when we were that drunk!
107,Rachel, No!
108,Joey," They let you get married when you’re drunk! Most people who get
married in Vegas are drunk!"
109,Phoebe," Hell, I’m drunk right now! (They all turn and look at her.) What? I
can’t have a mimosa with breakfast?! I’m on vacation!"
110,Monica, What are you guys gonna do?
111,Rachel," Well, I guess we just find a divorce lawyer? (Looks at Ross.)"
112,Chandler," Well, I think, I think, Ross already has one. Now, this one’s
free, right? Because you paid for the first two, so the third one’s free."
113,Ross," Laugh it up, but the joke’s on you. Because we don’t need to get
divorced, okay? We we’re just gonna get an annulment. "
114,Joey, An annulment? Ross! I don’t think surgery’s the answer here.
115,Phoebe," Oh-oh, that’s your thing."
116,Ross, What?
117,Phoebe," You’re thing. You’re thing. Y’know? You’re the guy
who gets divorced."
119,Ross," No-no, that’s-that’s not my thing! I do not love getting
divorced!"
120,Phoebe," Yes you do! This is your third divorce! You love divorce so much
you’re probably gonna marry it! Then it won’t work out and you’re gonna
have to divorce it, divorcing guy. (Pause) I’m so drunk."
122,Monica," So, what do you think we should do?"
123,Chandler, I don’t know. But I-I-I know I love you!
124,Monica, I know I love you! (They hug.)
125,Chandler," So where are we on the whole going back to the place where they have
all the marriages thing? I love you."
126,Monica," That’s a good question. Look umm, last night we let the dice
decide. Maybe we should leave it up to fate again. I love you!"
127,Chandler," Yes, we don’t get married unless there’s a sign! Okay, so
say uh, say you roll another eight (motions to the craps table) then there’s a definite
sign that we should get married."
128,Monica," All right, eight we get married, but 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12 we
don’t get married."
129,Chandler, Sounds great.
130,Monica, Okay. (They approach the craps table.)
132,Monica, Ready?
133,Chandler, Ready!
134,Monica, (sarcastic) Come on eight.
135,Chandler," (deadpan) Yes, yes eight."
138,Monica, Wow! I can’t believe I actually rolled an eight.
139,Chandler," That was so unlikely. Well, let’s get married! I guess."
140,Monica," Wait a minute. That wasn’t a hard eight! Last night I rolled a hard
eight."
141,Chandler," That’s right! It was the wrong kind of eight, no wedding! Damnit!"
142,Monica, I wanted it so bad! (Pause) Wanna go pack?
143,Chandler," Yeah. (They go pack.) We’re doing the right thing, right?"
144,Monica," Ohh, of course we are! (They walk up to the elevators.) We left it up to
fate. (Pushes the elevator button.) If we were supposed to get married there would be a
clear-cut sign. (The elevator door opens to a priest reading from a bible with Chandler
and Monica standing side-by-side holding each other’s hands.)"
146,Phoebe," Okay, you have 19 questions left. Use them wisely. (Joey groans.) Come
on Joey! You can’t win if you don’t ask any (sees that he’s asleep) QUESTIONS!!!"
147,Joey, (wakes up) What?!
148,Phoebe," Well, you promised me a fun road trip! We’ve been on the road six
hours and you’ve been asleep for five and a half! We are switching at the next rest
stop and you are going to drive all the way back! That will be your punishment, you
greedy sleeper!"
149,Joey, All right. All right.
150,Phoebe," Yeah! And until then you are going to sing to me because the
radio’s broken and you are selfish but have a nice voice."
151,Joey, Really? I don’t…
152,Phoebe, Sing!!
153,Joey, (starts singing) I wanna rock and roll all night! (Falls asleep.)
155,Joey," (to himself) Man, this is a long drive! Are my eyes open? No! (He opens
his eyes and sees a hitchhiker.)"
159,Ross, Hey!
160,Rachel," Hey, hubby!"
161,Ross," Yeah. Yeah, actually um, I wanted to talk to you about that whole
annulment thing?"
162,Rachel, Uh-huh.
163,Ross, I’m not going to do that. (Rachel glares at him.)
166,Rachel," Okay! So, we’ll just stay married."
167,Ross," Yes, exactly!"
168,Rachel, And I will make everyone call me Mrs. Geller!
169,Ross," Wow! This is so amazing. I uh, I really thought I’d have to talk you
into this more."
170,Rachel," Okay, see now I’m scared because I don’t actually think
you’re kidding."
171,Ross," I’m-I’m not kidding. Look I-I, I can’t have three
failed marriages. I can’t. Okay? I-I am not gonna be that guy!"
172,Rachel, What-wh-what so we’ll just stay married forever?!
173,Ross," Okay, look, how is this gonna affect you? Really? I mean you fill some
form out once and a while and instead of checking the box that says Ms you check the box
that says Mrs.! It’s right next to it!"
174,Rachel," Ohh, okay, I’m sorry. You’re right. Y’know what? We
absolutely can stay married, because I was under the impression that the boxes were far away
from each other. All right, look, just please, take a moment here and think about what
you’re asking of me."
175,Ross, I’m asking you to do me a favor. 
177,Rachel, You are asking me to be your wife!
178,Ross, And as my wife I think you should grant me this favor.
180,Monica, That kid really kicked me hard on the plane.
181,Chandler, Well you did pull his hair.
182,Monica, He took my snack!
183,Chandler, I’m not getting into this again!
184,Monica," Okay! Oh God, y’know what? It’s really bad."
185,Chandler,"  Well, I told you not to walk. Here. (Picks her up.) There. Okay.
(He opens the door, carries her across the threshold, stops, backs out, and lets go of
Monica who is only holding on by his neck.)"
186,Monica," This doesn’t mean anything, does it?"
187,Chandler, No!
188,Monica, Okay.
190,Phoebe," (To Joey) How could you pick up a hitchhiker?! He could be a
rape—(She holds her hand in front of the hitchhiker’s face), a rapist or a
killer or something!"
191,Joey, Don’t you think I asked him that before he got in?!
192,Phoebe," Y’know what? I’m not talking to you! You go back to sleep! (To
the hitchhiker) And you, are you a rapist?!"
194,Phoebe, Do you like car games?
196,Phoebe, I love the license plate game!
197,Joey," Ooh, I’ll play! I’ll play!"
198,Phoebe," No-No! You need your sleep. Night-night! Shh! (She closes the
partition.) "
200,Ross, Hey!
201,Rachel, Hey!
202,Ross," Listen, I know you wanted to talk to me, but I have an idea that may make
you want to stay married. (Rachel shakes her head.) We register, and you get to
keep all the presents!"
203,Rachel," (thinks about it for a second) No! Ross, come on! No! Listen, look I
thought a lot about how to tell you this and the bottom line, Ross, is we can not stay
married."
204,Ross, I don’t know if it’s true.
205,Rachel, Oh b-b-but it is!
206,Ross," Oh, okay, y’know what this is? This is a difference of
opinion. And when that happens in a marriage..."
207,Rachel," Oh Ross, come on! This is not, this is not a marriage!! This is the
world’s worst hangover! Ross, listen, if you do not get this annulment, I
will!"
208,Ross," All right. All right, I’ll do it."
209,Rachel," Thank you. (He goes to leave.) Hey-hey umm, uh, is there, is there any
such thing as an annulment shower?"
213,Phoebe," Oh, okay."
215,Phoebe," And I have your name and the fact that you’re a drifter, so the
ball’s pretty much in your court."
217,Joey," Come on Pheebs! I can’t take this anymore! Let-let me make it up to
you. Huh? (Starts singing.) Ground control to Major Tom. Commencing countdown, engines
on. Take your protein pills and put your helmet on!"
218,Phoebe," Stop it! Stop it no! That’s not fair! Y’know I can’t
resist that beautiful voice!"
219,Joey," Pheebs, I am so sorry! I know I promised you a fun road trip with your
friend and I didn’t deliver. But-but-but now I know that you think being awake is an
important part of friendship! So, so, so I will strive to-to stay awake for as long as I
know you."
220,Phoebe, You can still sleep at night and stuff.
221,Joey," Well, thank you. So, can we play 20 Questions now? I’ve got a really
good one! I’ve been thinking about it since Kansas."
222,Phoebe, Okay. Is it a kind of hot sandwich?
223,Joey, Yes.
224,Phoebe, Is it a meatball sub?
225,Joey, That is incredible! You are the master!
227,Rachel," Huh, that’s funny. You look like you’re gonna be the…"
228,Monica," No, don’t say it! Don’t even think it!"
229,Rachel," All right. Okay Chandler, enjoy your handful. (Exits.)"
230,Chandler," All right, should we just, should we just get married? Y’know? I
mean should we just do it? All the signs are telling us to do it."
231,Monica," I’m sick of the signs! It’s too fast, I’m happy the way
things are!"
232,Chandler, Me too!
233,Monica, I don’t want things to change! Do you?
234,Chandler, No!
235,Monica," All right then, then nothing changes! Everything is great! Everything
stays the same! And you go unpack because it’s been three days and it’s driving
me insane!"
236,Chandler," Jeez, relax! It’s not like we’re mar-ah-ah!! (Runs out.)"
237,Chandler," (entering, slowly) Y’know I was thinking, what if I uh, unpack
here?"
238,Monica, Then all your stuff would be here.
239,Chandler," Well, what if all my stuff was here?"
240,Monica," Then you’d be going back and forth all the time, I mean it
doesn’t make any sense."
241,Chandler," Okay. What if we lived together and you understand what I’m
saying?"
242,Monica, Live together? There have been no signs for that.
243,Chandler, Me asking is kind of a sign.
244,Monica, YES!!!!!!!!
245,Chandler, Okay!!!!!
247,Monica, Yes! Okay! Okay! Wait-wait-wait!
248,Chandler, Okay.
249,Monica, Here’s your key (Gets him one.)
250,Chandler, Oh thanks.
251,Monica," Here’s your key. All right, you have to christen it! Now, go out
and come back in!"
252,Chandler," The door hasn’t been locked in five years, but okay! (Runs out.)
Ready?!"
253,Monica, Ready!
255,Chandler," Okay, a little problem. The key broke in the lock and I can’t get
in!"
256,Monica, Wait! Oh my God! I can’t get out!
257,Chandler, This is not a sign!
258,Monica," No, it’s not a sign! It’s a very old key!"
259,Chandler, It’s an old key!
260,Monica, Oh my God it’s old!
261,Chandler, I love you!
262,Monica, I love you!
263,Chandler, Are you hugging the door right now.
265,Monica, No.
266,Chandler," Yeah-yeah, me neither."
268,Ross, Hey!
269,Rachel," Hey, so did everything go all right with the annulment?"
270,Ross," Oh, yeah, no problems. It’s all taken care of."
271,Rachel," Ross, thank you. Hey, do you guys wanna go see a movie?"
272,Ross," Oh yeah, why not?"
273,Rachel, Pheebs?
274,Phoebe," No thanks, I’ve already seen one."
275,Rachel," Okay, umm, I’m gonna get my sweater. (Walks away.)"
276,Ross," Okay. (Sits down next to Phoebe.) You uh, you wanna hear something weird?"
277,Phoebe, Always.
278,Ross, I didn’t get the annulment.
279,Phoebe, What?!
280,Ross," We’re still married! Don’t tell Rachel. See you later. (He gets
up leaving Phoebe in shock.)"
283,Joey, What are you doing?
284,Chandler, The key’s stuck in the lock.
285,Joey," I can fix it. Hold on. (He goes and gets a screwdriver from his apartment)
Look out. Look out. (Pries at the door a little bit.)"
286,Chandler, (trying the handle) It still doesn’t work.
287,Joey, I’m not finished.
288,Chandler, Oh.
290,Chandler, Nice job Joe! You’re quite the craftsmen.
0,Ross, Hey!
1,Rachel," Hey, so did everything go okay with the annulment?"
2,Ross," Oh, yeah, no problems. It’s all taken care of."
3,Rachel," Ross, thank you. Hey, do you guys wanna go see a movie?"
4,Ross," Oh yeah, why not?"
5,Rachel," Okay, umm, I’m gonna get my sweater. (Walks away.)"
6,Ross," Okay. (Sits down next to Phoebe.) You uh, you wanna hear something weird?"
7,Phoebe, Always.
8,Ross, I didn’t get the annulment.
9,Phoebe, What?!
10,Ross," We’re still married! Don’t tell Rachel. See you later. (He gets
up leaving Phoebe in shock.)"
12,Ross," (To Rachel) Hey, do you have any gum?"
13,Rachel, Oh? Yeah! Sure!
14,Phoebe," (running out) Wait! Wait! Hi! Listen, Ross can I just talk to you for
just a second?"
15,Rachel," Oh but Phoebe, we’re gonna be late for the movie."
17,Phoebe," Oh, there’s a cab! Taxi!! (The cab stops and she opens the door.)
Good timing, my God, huh? Here you go. (Pushes Rachel in and closes the door.) "
18,Rachel," Yeah, we’re, we’re actually just gonna walk ‘cause
it’s right up there at the Angelica."
19,Phoebe," Oh, the Angelica!! Go! Go! (She bangs on the cab’s roof and it
pulls away.) (To Ross) You didn’t get the annulment?!!"
20,Ross, I know.
21,Phoebe, Ross?!
22,Ross," Well, I tried! But when I got to my lawyer’s office all I could hear
was, ""Three divorces. Three divorces!"" Look, I just don’t want my tombstone
to read, Ross Gellar, Three Divorces."
23,Phoebe," Don’t be worried about that! Your tombstone can say whatever you
want it to say! It could say, Ross Geller, Good at Marriage! Y’know? Mine’s
gonna say Phoebe Buffay, Buried Alive."
24,Ross," Look, all I know is I-I can’t have another failed marriage!"
25,Phoebe," So okay what? You’re gonna be married to a girl who doesn’t
even know about it?!—Op, woman! Sorry."
26,Ross," Well, okay so, I don’t have it all worked out quite yet. Just
don’t say anything to Rachel, please?"
27,Phoebe," Rachel is one of my closest friends. (Pause) Although, being the only
one who knows anything about this does makes me feel special. Okay!"
29,Rachel," (to the driver) Okay, stop-stop! Phoebe?!"
30,Phoebe, Hey Rach!
31,Rachel, What was that?!
32,Phoebe," Sorry, mix up. Hey, how was the movie?"
33,Rachel, I haven’t seen it yet!
34,Phoebe," Well then you’d better hurry! The Angelica! Go! Go! (Bangs on the
roof again and off they go.)"
35,Rachel, Noooooooo!!
39,Chandler," Y’know when we move in together, can I get a gumball machine?"
40,Monica, Of course! Joey wouldn’t let you have one?
41,Chandler," No. When it comes to sweets, he’s surprisingly strict."
42,Monica," Hey, have you figured out a way to tell him you’re moving out? "
43,Chandler," No, no, I keep trying, y’know? I can get out, ""Joey, I have
too…"" but then I lose my nerve and I always finish with, ""…go to the
bathroom."" He may think I’m sick."
44,Monica," Y’know, I really have to tell Rachel, but I… We just have to
get it over with! Y’know, the next time we see them we’re just gonna tell them.
Okay? That’s it."
45,Chandler," Oh, so that’s this is gonna work now? You’re just gonna
order me around all the time?"
46,Monica, Pretty much.
47,Chandler, All right.
48,Joey, (entering) Hey Monica!
49,Monica, Hi!
50,Joey," (To Chandler) Hey man, you feeling any better? (Chandler answers him
with some guttural sounds that only he can make and that no human can transcribe.)"
51,Monica," Joey, we have something to tell you."
52,Joey, Oh my God! You’re pregnant!
53,Chandler," No-o-o! (To Monica) No? (She nods no.) No-o-o! Look Joey, here’s
the thing, Monica and I have decided to live together, here. So, I’m gonna be moving
out man."
54,Joey," Wow! (Tearing up) Well, uh… Hey! I’m really happy for you guys!
Congratulations! (Kisses Monica on the cheek) See you later. (Starts for the door on the
verge of tears as Monica stops him.)"
55,Monica, Wait! Joey! Joey! Are you okay?!
56,Joey," Yeah, I gotta go! I got an acting job. (Turns towards the door, pauses,
and turns back.) Like you’d believe that. This sucks!"
57,Chandler," Look, I-I’m just gonna be right across the hall and I promise
you, the minute Monica and I break up I’m moving right back in with you!"
58,Joey," (To Monica) Okay! Look-look-look, uh, if you’re gonna be moving in
with him I feel it’s my responsibility to tell you the truth about him! Okay?
He’s a terrible roommate! Terrible! He uh, forgets to umm… Oh-oh he always, he
always umm—Oh, who am I kidding! He’s the best roommate ever! (Hugs Chandler.)"
60,Monica, Hey Pheebs! 
61,Phoebe, Hey!
62,Monica," Hey, have you seen Rachel?"
63,Phoebe," No, why?"
64,Monica, I have some pretty exciting news!
65,Phoebe, (gasps) You’re pregnant!
66,Monica, No! Chandler and I are moving in together!
67,Phoebe," Ooh! That’s good! Wow! But now if you were pregnant, what would you
name it? Hint Phoebe."
69,Ross, Hey! Hi!
70,Monica, Hey!
71,Ross, What’s up?
72,Monica," Well umm, Chandler and I are moving in together."
73,Ross," Oh my God. Ohh, my little sister and my best friend…shaking up. Oh,
that’s great. That’s great. (Kisses and hugs her.)"
74,Phoebe," Guys, I’m happy too."
75,Monica," Okay, come here! (Phoebe joins them in the hug.)"
76,Phoebe," Wow! Big day huh? People moving in, people getting annulled… (Winks
at Ross.)"
77,Monica," Okay, I gotta go find Rachel but umm, if you guys see her could you
please try to give her some really bad news so that mine doesn’t seem so bad?
(Exits.)"
78,Ross, Bye.
79,Phoebe," Hmm, something bad to tell Rachel… Bad news for Rachel, what could
that be?!"
80,Ross," Could ya just, could ya just lay off, please? All right? My life is an
embarrassment! I should go live under somebody’s stairs!"
81,Phoebe," Ross, it’s not that big a deal! So you’ll been divorced three
times, you’ll still have a life, you’ll go on dates…"
82,Ross," (interrupting) No! No, I won’t! I’ll be at the bottom of the
dating barrel now. The only guys below me will be Four Divorce Guy uh, Murderer Guy,
and-and, Geologists."
83,Phoebe," Ross, you’re being ridiculous! Okay? You are cute and smart and
sweet and that is much more important than three stupid divorces!"
84,Ross, Oh yeah? Have you ever dated anyone who has been divorced three times?
85,Phoebe," Y’know that’s really fair. Y’know? Most guys who have
been divorced three times are like 60. Ross, nobody cares about this except you! This-this
embarrassment thing is all in your head! Here, I’ll show you! Come here."
86,Ross, What?! Why?
88,Phoebe," (to the girls) Hi! Hi! Listen, my friend Ross is about to be divorced
for the third time, but wouldn’t you date him?"
89,Ross," And if you wait right here, I’ll go get Ross. (Phoebe grabs his arm
and prevents him from escaping.)"
91,Chandler, (entering) Hey!
92,Monica," Ugh, I thought you were Rachel!"
93,Chandler, (looking down) What gave me away?
94,Monica," I just tell her, I have to get it over with. I told Ross and Phoebe and
she’s the only one left!"
95,Chandler," Okay, so that’s it, everybody knows! It’s official,
we’re moving in together. No turning back. Are ya scared? Are ya?"
96,Monica, No.
97,Chandler, Wow that was my scariest voice! You’re very brave.
99,Rachel, Hey!
100,Chandler, Hey.
101,Rachel," Ugh, the worse day! Y’know, you think you’re making progress
at work and then your boss calls you Raquel."
102,Chandler," Hey listen, for the first four years of my work everybody called me
Sha-la-lap. (Awkward silence ensues.) Seriously."
103,Rachel," I believe you. So, it was right in the middle of a staff meeting so of
course no one else wants to correct her so everyone else is calling me Raquel! By the end
of the day, the mailroom guys were calling me Rocky!"
104,Chandler," Well, I-I still think you’re very-very nice and very pretty…"
105,Rachel, What?
106,Chandler, (To Monica) All yours babe. (Walks away.)
107,Monica," Have a seat. (They sit at the table.) Okay, listen umm, Chandler and I
are going to live together, here."
108,Rachel, Oh my God! That’s so great! I’m so happy for you guys! 
109,Monica, Really?!
110,Rachel," And that was so sweet of you to ask! Oh my God, the three of us are
gonna have such a good time living together!"
111,Monica," Yes, we are. (Chandler is frantically trying to get Monica to correct
her.)"
112,Rachel," And Chandler, you’re gonna have to watch those long showers you
take in the morning because you know Raquel can’t be late."
113,Chandler, Rach…
114,Monica," Yeah, he’s gonna work on that."
115,Rachel," Ohh! This is so exciting! Oh God… (Gasps and starts to sing)
Come and knock on my door…"
116,Monica, (singing) We’ll be waiting for you…
120,Ross," …once you know the stories, it’s not that bad. First marriage,
wife’s hidden sexuality, not my fault. Second marriage, said the wrong name at the
altar, a little my fault. Third marriage, well they really shouldn’t allow you to get
married when you’re that drunk and have writing all over your face, Nevada’s
fault."
121,Phoebe," Okay, so what do you think ladies? Who wouldn’t be interested? Who
wouldn’t want to date him?"
123,Phoebe," Okay, what about you? (Points to Karin) Wouldn’t you want a date?"
125,Phoebe, (interrupting) Whatever! What about you Meg?
127,Ross, What?!
128,Phoebe," (leaning to him) She said, ""He’s obviously still in love with
this Rachel girl."" (He glares at her.)"
129,Ross," This is crazy! I mean, yes-yes Rachel is my good friend and I-I have loved
her in the past, but now, she is just my wife! Phoebe, will you-will you help me
out here?"
130,Phoebe," Well, I thought you loved her when you-when you married her."
131,Ross," We were drunk! I would’ve married uh, Joey with that amount of
alcohol!"
132,Phoebe, Hey! You could do a lot worse than Joey Tribbiani!! 
133,Ross," (to the panel) Look, I’m sorry, but you guys are wrong. I just
don’t want to be divorced three times."
134,Phoebe," Yes, and now he’s using this three divorces reason because he wants
to stay married to her because he loves her. I must say, ""Well done!"" Bravo Meg."
135,Ross," (getting up) Okay! Fine! Fine! If-if this is what you think, forget about
the whole three divorce thing! Okay, I-I’ll go to my lawyer’s office right now
and get this marriage annulled! Okay?! Because she means nothing to me! Noth—(leans
down to Meg’s ear)—Nothing!!"
139,Chandler," Okay, when are we gonna tell Rachel what is actually gonna happen?"
140,Monica," Soon! I-I just couldn’t before. You saw how upset Joey got! I
couldn’t do that to her, she’s my best friend!"
141,Chandler," Well, Joey’s my best friend."
142,Monica, I’m not your best friend?
143,Chandler," You just said… Of course you’re my best friend. Would you
please tell Rachel though?"
144,Monica," All right, all right, at least I’m prepared."
145,Chandler," Okay. (She grabs a tin of freshly baked cookies) Oh yes. (He reaches
for one.)"
146,Monica, (slapping his hand) Hey!
147,Chandler, Hey-hey!
148,Monica, These aren’t for you! Are you upset?
149,Chandler, I am now!
150,Rachel, (entering) Hey roomie!
151,Chandler," Okay, bye! (Exits.)"
152,Monica," Rach, there’s something uh, important I have to tell you."
153,Rachel, (gasps) Are you pregnant?!
154,Monica," No! But, I’m throwing this shirt away! I think there was a little
misunderstanding before."
155,Rachel, Um-hmm.
156,Monica," Umm, when I said that uh, that Chandler and I wanted to umm, live
together we meant alone together."
157,Rachel," (laughs) Oh my God! Oh, that’s funny, I can’t believe I did
that."
158,Monica," Oh no sweetie, no! This is my fault, I wasn’t clear! I’m
really sorry. And listen, you take as much time as you need to move out okay? There’s
absolutely no rush."
159,Rachel, Okay. (Sits back and resumes her reading.)
160,Monica, Okay. Don’t you want a cookie?
161,Rachel, Sure? (Monica hands her one.) Thanks.
162,Monica," Maybe, do you need a tissue?"
164,Rachel," Monica, where did you get these?!"
165,Monica, I made them!
166,Rachel," Ooh, good God, they’re so yummy! (She re-ingests the previously
expelled cookie matter from the tissue.)"
168,Joey," God, it’s gonna so weird like when I come home and you’re not
here. Y’know? No more Joey and Chan’s. No more J and C’s. ""You wanna
go over to Joey and Chandler’s?"" ""Can’t, its not there."""
169,Chandler," Look, I’m just gonna be across the hall, we can still do all the
same stuff."
170,Joey," Yeah but we won’t be able to like get up in the middle of the night
and have those long talks about our feelings and the future."
171,Chandler, Not once did we do that.
172,Monica, (entering) Hi.
173,Chandler, Hey!
174,Joey, Hi.
175,Monica," So I, I told Rachel it was just gonna be the two of us."
176,Chandler," Oh yeah? Well, how’d she take it?"
177,Monica," Really well. Yeah. Surprisingly well. Yeah, she didn’t cry. She
wasn’t angry or sad. (Sits down, slightly disgusted.)"
178,Chandler," And you’re upset because you didn’t make your best friend
cry?"
179,Monica," I mean, all I’m asking for is just a little emotion! Is that too
much to ask after six years?! I mean what? Are-are-are Rachel and I not as close as you
guys?! I mean do we not have as much fun?! Don’t I deserve a few tears?!! I mean
we-we told Joey, he cried his eyes out!"
180,Joey," Hey! I did not cry my eyes out!! Come on! It’s like the end of an
era! No more J-man and Channie’s!! "
181,Chandler," Okay, I gotta ask, who calls us that?!"
184,Ross, Yes.
186,Ross," Yes, second in two years. Third overall."
188,Ross," Basically, Rachel and I were in Vegas and we got drunk…"
190,Ross," Yes-yes-yes! But, I-I do not love her."
192,Ross, This was just a drunken mistake and I need to get it annulled.
194,Ross, I think just the annulment for today.
196,Ross, Easy.
198,Ross, No problem.
200,Ross," Ooh! There’s no way to do this without her? ‘Cause I kinda all
ready told her uh, it was, it was already taken care of."
202,Ross," Uh-ha, what about someone who looks like Rachel? (Russell glares at him.)
I will think about the therapy."
204,Rachel, Hey!
205,Monica," Hey. So um, I was thinking that maybe we should start dividing up our
stuff."
206,Rachel, Okay!
207,Monica," Y’know, no point in dragging it out. Dragging out the long
process of you moving out and us not living together anymore."
208,Rachel, Okay.
209,Monica," Hey Rach, what about this? (She holds up a chrome 5-point star.) Huh?
Who-who gets this? See, I don’t know if I want it because it might be y’know,
too many memories!"
210,Rachel, (grabbing the star) What the hell is that?
211,Monica," I don’t know. (Picks up a big plate from the coffee table.) Hey,
Rachel, you want the big plate? I want you to have the big plate."
212,Rachel," Wow! Mon, thanks! I love this plate!"
213,Monica, Something to remember me by!
214,Rachel," Mon, honey you’re not dying. I’m just moving out. Y’know,
I mean we’re gonna see each other all the time."
215,Monica," But still, it’s a big change. The end of an era, you might say!"
216,Rachel, Are you okay? You’re not blinking.
217,Monica," I’m fine! I just, I’m thinking how much it’s an end of
era."
218,Rachel," Oh, all right. But y’know I gotta say, I don’t, I don’t
think six years counts as an era."
219,Monica," An era is defined as a significant period of time. Now, it was
significant to me, maybe it wasn’t significant to you!"
220,Rachel, What is the matter with you?!
221,Monica," What is the matter with you?!! Why aren’t you more upset?!
Aren’t you gonna be sad that we’re not gonna be living together anymore?! I mean
aren’t you gonna miss me at all?!"
222,Rachel," All right, fine, but don’t get mad at me. It’s-it’s just
a little hard to believe."
223,Monica, What’s hard to believe?
224,Rachel," Well y’know, it’s you guys. You-you do this kind of stuff!
Y’know? I mean, you-you were gonna get married in Vegas and then you backed out! I
guess I’m not upset because I don’t see you guys going through with it. I’m
sorry."
225,Monica," Rachel, it’s going to happen. Chandler is gonna move in here."
226,Rachel, But I…
227,Monica," No-no, wait! Just let me finish, okay? This isn’t something that we
just, we just impulsively decided in-in Vegas, this is something we both really want. And
it is going to happen."
228,Rachel, It is? Really?
229,Monica," Yeah, sweetie."
230,Rachel," (starting to lose her composure) I mean we’re not, we’re not
gonna live together anymore?"
231,Monica, No.
232,Rachel, What? Oh my God! I’m gonna miss you so much! (Starts to cry.)
233,Monica, I’m gonna miss you! (They hug.)
234,Rachel, I mean it’s the end of an era!
235,Monica, I know!
237,Phoebe," (to Joey and Chandler) Okay, bye!"
238,Ross, Oh no.
239,Phoebe, So? Did you get the annulment?
240,Ross, I couldn’t.
241,Phoebe, I knew it! Because you love Rachel.
242,Ross, It’s not that. Okay? Annulments are more complicated than I…
243,Phoebe," Yeah, complicated ‘cause of the love."
244,Ross," I… I do, I do not love Rachel. I’m gonna tell her right now
about the whole thing so we can get this marriage annulled as fast as possible. Okay?
Would I do that if I loved her?"
245,Phoebe, I’ve never been more convinced of your love for her.
246,Ross, I do not have feelings for Rachel! Okay?! (He goes into her apartment.)
248,Ross," Ohh, what’s wrong?!"
249,Rachel," Monica and Chandler are really moving in here and I have to move out and
everything is changing."
250,Ross," Oh my—Come here! Come here! (He hugs her.) It’s okay.
Everything’s gonna be okay."
251,Rachel, Thank you.
252,Ross, Of course.
256,Joey," So, Ross and Rachel got married, Monica and Chandler almost got married,
do you think you and I should hook up?"
257,Phoebe," Oh we do, but not just yet."
258,Joey," Really?! Well, when?"
259,Phoebe," Okay umm, well, first Chandler and Monica will get married and be filthy
rich by the way. Yeah. But it won’t work out."
260,Joey, Wow.
261,Phoebe," I know. Then, I’m gonna marry Chandler for the money and
you’ll marry Rachel and have the beautiful kids."
262,Joey, Great!
263,Phoebe," But then we ditch those two and that’s when we get married.
We’ll have Chandler’s money and Rachel’s kids and getting custody will be
easy because of Rachel’s drinking problem."
264,Joey," Oh-oh, what about Ross?"
265,Phoebe," I don’t want to go into the whole thing, but umm, we have words and
I kill him."
0,Chandler, (entering) Hey!
1,Phoebe," Hey! Check it out! This is unbelievable! Joey has been holding his
breath for almost four minutes! "
3,Joey, (To Chandler) Dude! What are yo—you trying to kill me?!
4,Rachel," (entering from her room) Pheebs, I wanna ask you something."
5,Phoebe," Uh-huh, what?"
6,Rachel," Well since I’m movin’ out and-and you’re so
beautiful…"
7,Phoebe, Oh!
8,Rachel, …how about I move in with you?
9,Phoebe," Well, that would be great but then what do we do about Denise?"
10,Monica, Who’s Denise?
11,Phoebe, My roommate.
12,Rachel, You have a roommate?!
13,Phoebe," Yes, Denise. Denise! "
14,Joey," Hey, what is with the secrecy Phoebe? Huh? And what about this Denise, is
she cute?"
15,Chandler," Pheebs, I don’t understand. How can you have a roommate that none
of us know anything about?"
16,Phoebe," Maybe because you never listen to anything that I say. I talk about her
all the time! DENISE!!!!!"
17,Joey," Hey Rach, listen I was thinkin’ uh, I’m gonna have an extra room
over at my place…"
18,Rachel," Oh, that’s true."
19,Joey," Yeah, why don’t you move in with me? It’ll be great! We could
stay up late, watch movies, and you know about Naked Thursday’s right?"
20,Rachel," Yeah, yeah I think I’m gonna find my own place."
21,Chandler, Hey-hey! I thought Naked Thursday’s was just our thing man!
24,Phoebe, Hey.
25,Ross, Hey!
26,Phoebe," So, what did Rachel say when you told her you were still married to her?"
27,Ross," Oh, that. Umm, she took it really well."
28,Phoebe, You didn’t tell her did you?
29,Ross, No. 
30,Phoebe," Of course not, because you’re in love with her."
31,Ross," I am not in love with her. She was very upset about having to move out so
I eh, didn’t tell her we were still married because she would only get more upset.
I-I just comforted her, as a friend."
32,Phoebe," What do you mean, comforted her?"
33,Ross," It’s nothing, I just gave her a hug."
34,Phoebe," Ah-ha! A classic sign of love, the hug!"
35,Ross, It’s also a sign of friendship.
36,Phoebe," Yeah, not in your case Lovey Loverson. (Tries to take a bite out of
Ross’s cookie.)"
37,Ross, (grabs back his cookie) It was a hug!
38,Phoebe," Okay, just tell me this, did you or did you not smell her hair?"
39,Ross, S-s-smell her hair? What if I did?
40,Phoebe," Ninety percent of a women’s pheromones come out the top of her
head! That’s why, that’s why women are shorter. So that men will fall in love
when they hug them! (Ross is staring at her dumbfounded.) Oh come on Ross, you’re a
scientist. "
41,Ross," I was hugging her as a friend. It’s not my fault her-her hair got in
my face, she’s got a lot of it and it smells all-all uh…coconutty. (Phoebe
raises her eyebrows.) What?! Oh, that doesn’t mean I have feelings for Rachel! Maybe
it means I have feelings for coconuts!"
42,Phoebe," (taking his coffee) Okay, whatever you say. But just be careful, all
right? Rachel’s not in the same place you are."
43,Ross," (grabbing back his coffee) If the place you are referring too is being in
love, then she is in the same place as me because I am not in that place!"
44,Phoebe," Okay, I didn’t understand that, but y’know, maybe that’s
‘cause you were speaking the secret language of love! "
47,Joey," Hey! (To Chandler) Dude, some guy just called for you."
48,Chandler, Who was it?
49,Joey," I don’t know! How about, ""Thanks for taking the message.""
Jeez! (Exits.)"
50,Monica," Okay listen, y’know when you move in Rachel’s room is gonna be
empty, you wanna talk about what we want to do with it?"
51,Chandler, Sure!
52,Monica," Okay, I was thinking we should have a beautiful guest room, right? With
a mahogany sleigh bed and bedside tables with flowers on them all the time! And we could
have a roll top desk with comment cards on them so people could say how much they loved
staying here!! Okay, whatever, I really haven’t thought about it that much."
53,Chandler," Well, I like that idea. Obviously! I was thinking maybe-maybe-maybe it
could be a game room, y’know? I mean you can buy old arcade games like uh, like Space
Invaders and Asteroids for $200, the real ones! The big-big ones!"
54,Monica, No.
55,Chandler," Okay so you mean no as in, ""Gee Chandler, what an interesting
idea. Let’s discuss it before we reject it completely."""
56,Monica," Oh, I’m sorry. Of course I mean that. Interesting idea, umm, talk
about it, but no."
57,Chandler," So, that’s it?"
58,Monica," I just don’t think arcade games go in the beautiful guest room. The
beautiful guest room is gonna be filled with antiques."
59,Chandler, Which is why Asteroids is perfect! It’s the oldest game!
60,Monica, What do you have against the beautiful guest room?
61,Chandler," I don’t have anything against the beautiful guest room,
especially since everybody we know lives about 30 seconds away!"
62,Monica, Are you mocking me?
63,Chandler," No, I’m not mocking you, (in a mocking voice) or you beautiful
guest room. (Exits.)"
65,Joey," Hey, what’s up?"
66,Chandler," Nothing, Monica and I had a stupid fight."
67,Joey," But you’re still moving in together, right? Because my ad came out
today. (Shows him the paper.)"
68,Chandler," (reading the ad) ""Wanted. Female roommate, non-smoker,
non-ugly."" Nice!"
69,Joey," Yeah? I just figured y’know, after living with you it’d be an
interesting change of pace to have a female roommate, y’know? Someone I can learn
from, someone-someone who’s different than me. And what’s more different than
me; a guy who’s not 19 than say a girl who is 19? Enh? (Points to his head.)
Not just a hat rack my friend!"
71,Rachel," Pheebs, I have to ask you…"
72,Phoebe, Shhhhhh! I’m swamped right now.
73,Rachel, You’re just staring into space.
74,Phoebe," Umm, I’m trying to move that pencil. (There’s a pencil lying
on the table.)"
75,Rachel, This one? (Picks it up.)
76,Phoebe, It worked!
77,Rachel," Pheebs, this whole apartment thing is just a nightmare! Every place I
can afford comes with a roommate who is a freak. I mean, look at this; (Points to one and
starts to read it.) ""Wanted. Female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly."" It’s
just, there is nothing! The city’s full!"
78,Phoebe," Wait, no, look at this! (Points to one.) (Reading) ""Two bedroom,
two bath, must be non-smoker, Satan worshipers okay…"" Oh, yeah, but it’s on
the ground floor."
79,Ross, (entering) Hey!
80,Rachel, Hey.
81,Ross," Rach, uh, you still looking for a place?"
82,Rachel, Yeah! Why?
83,Ross," Okay, there’s this guy, Warren, from the museum and he’s going
on a dig for like two years and he’s got this great place he needs to sublet. So uh,
you interested?"
84,Rachel," That sounds great! I’d love to live at Warren’s!! I love
Warren! Thank you!"
85,Ross," Don’t thank me! If you wanna thank something, thank the volcano that
erupted thousands of years ago, killing but perfectly preserving an entire civilization.
(Rachel just looks at him.) Here’s Warren’s number."
86,Rachel," Oh, this is great! I am gonna call him right now! (Jumps up.) Oh, thank
you! "
88,Ross," Okay, you go grab it!"
89,Phoebe, I saw it.
90,Ross, I don’t know what you’re talking about.
91,Phoebe," Umm, I’m talking about that which you already know but won’t
admit. You love her again; you re-love her!"
92,Ross," Look, I do not re-love her."
93,Phoebe," I can’t believe you won’t just admit it! (Pause) Okay, just
promise me that you won’t do anything stupid."
94,Ross," Look, we’re just friends now! Okay? Why would I do anything stupid?"
95,Rachel," (returning from calling Warren) Ugh!!! Well, the apartment is already
subletted! I mean, this is just hopeless. I’m never gonna find anything."
96,Ross, You can live with me.
97,Rachel, What?!
98,Phoebe, What?!
99,Ross, What?
102,Rachel, Oh my God! Are you serious?!
103,Ross, Uh-huh. (Phoebe grunts.)
104,Rachel," I would love to live with you Ross; that’s-that’s great! Thank
you!"
105,Ross," Well, I’m-I’m just glad I could, y’know, help you out."
106,Phoebe," Wow! I’m-I’m so happy for you guys. (To Ross) This is so-so,
not stupid."
107,Rachel," Ross-Ross, you have no idea what this means to me! I mean, I mean I was
gonna be homeless. You just saved me! You’re my hero!"
108,Ross," Hero, I uh, I don’t know—well, all right."
109,Rachel," Oh, I have to go tell Monica what a wonderful brother she has! (Kisses
him on the cheek and exits.) "
110,Ross," Oh please! (He sits down.) (To Phoebe) You’re gonna say things now,
aren’t ya?"
111,Phoebe," No. No, I won’t. But I should tell you this, this exact same thing
happened to my roommate Denise. She moved in with a guy who was secretly married to her
and he said he didn’t love her, but he really did, and it just blew up! And
that’s how she ended up living with me! (Ross looks at her.) (Pause) Okay,
that’s a lie."
113,Chandler, Hi.
114,Monica, Hi.
115,Chandler," Hi, listen, I’m sorry about before. I don’t need to have a
game room. I mean when I was a kid I only played those games because I couldn’t get
girls, and now I can ‘em—Now, I have you. (Monica glares at him.) Not-not
that I think that I have you or think of you as property in any sort of way, I see
women…"
116,Monica, Stop it Chandler. (Chandler is relieved) I’m sorry too.
117,Chandler, Really?
118,Monica, Yeah! Oh yes!
119,Chandler, Ohh.
120,Monica," Listen, we don’t have to make that a guest room, we can think of
something to do with the room together."
121,Chandler," That’s a great idea! We can easily think of a way for us
both to enjoy the room."
122,Monica, Totally!
124,Chandler, We don’t have to come up with this now.
125,Monica, Oh good.
126,Chandler," Hey, y’know what? Why don’t we think about changes we can
make in the living room?"
127,Monica, Changes?
128,Chandler," Yeah, I mean we’re gonna have to move around some furniture to
make room for my chair. (Kisses her and heads into the living room.)"
129,Monica," You’re-you’re-you’re gonna bring the Barca Lounger over
here?"
130,Chandler, Is that a problem?
131,Monica," Well, it’s a set and they should probably stay together."
132,Chandler," Oh, that’s cool. Then I’ll just bring them both over."
133,Monica, See now-now you’re taking them away from their home.
134,Chandler," Okay, I get it. So, I get nothing! Nothing here is mine! Everything
here is yours! I’ll get up in the morning put on your clothes, and head off to work!"
135,Monica," Yeah-yeah, y’know what? Yeah, that’s it-that’s it,
everything will be mine! Nothing will be yours! That’s-that’s what I said! Oh
come on, Chandler! I’m talking about the barca lounger! It just, it doesn’t
match! Where is it gonna go?!"
136,Chandler, In the game room!
137,Monica, Look it is not my fault that your chairs are incredibly ugly!
138,Chandler," All right! That’s fine! That’s fine! I won’t bring over
the chairs! I won’t bring anything over! I wouldn’t want to ruin the ambiance
over here at Grandma’s place!! (Storms out.)"
140,Joey," (exiting from Chandler’s room with the new roommate) Everything on
your application looks really good—Ohh! Just one last question umm, are you and your
friends gonna be over here all the time like partying and hanging out?"
142,Joey," Whoa!! Now look, don’t be just blurtin’ stuff out. I want you to
really think about your answers. Okay?"
143,Chandler," (entering) You can call off the roommate search! (To the potential
roommate) Hi! I’ll be living here. (Heads for the bathroom.)"
144,Joey," Oh don’t listen to him, he’s just some guy who really wants the
apartment, but I don’t think he’s gonna get it."
145,Chandler, Why did you take the shower curtain down?
146,Joey," That thing was a hazard! (To the potential roommate) I’m very safety
conscious."
148,Rachel, Hey!
149,Ross," Hey! Oh listen, I was just clearing some space for your stuff."
150,Rachel," Oh thanks, but listen, I was just at Monica’s and she and Chandler
had a big fight and they’re not moving in."
151,Ross," What do you mean, they’re not moving in? They-they’re still
moving in right?"
152,Rachel," No-no, they just had a big blowout over what to do with my room."
153,Ross, What?! Over a stupid room!
154,Rachel," Yeah, I feel kinda bad for them, but I’m also really psyched
‘cause I don’t have to move in here!"
155,Ross," Oh no, yeah no, that part’s great!"
157,Ross," What’s all this about you guys fighting?! Is this really over a
room?! I mean, that is so silly!"
158,Monica," Ross, we can handle this."
159,Ross," Well, apparently not, and I can’t just stand by and watch two people
I care about very much be hurt over something that is so silly. I mean, enough of the
silliness!"
160,Chandler," Well, why don’t you tell her to stop being silly! (Monica mocks
him and he joins in.)"
161,Ross," (stopping them) Okay-okay! Two very good points, look I’ve known you
both a long time, and I’ve never seen either of you one/millionth as happy as
you’ve been since you’ve got together. Do you really want to throw that all away
over a room? That is so silly. Now wh-what is more important, love or silliness?"
162,Chandler," Well, we are fond of the silliness, but we also have a soft spot for
the love."
163,Monica, Love is the best medicine.
164,Chandler, That’s laughter.
165,Monica, Why do you do it?
166,Chandler, I don’t know.
167,Ross," Okay! All right! Now, Chandler you-you wanna live with Monica, right?"
168,Chandler," Yeah, I do."
169,Ross," And Mon, you wanna live with Chandler, don’t ya?"
170,Monica, Yes.
171,Ross," (jumping up) Good! A verbal contract is binding in the state of New York!
(Storms out.)"
174,Rachel," No-no, I’m staying put."
176,Rachel," Why, where are you going?"
178,Ross, (entering) Hey Rach!
179,Rachel, Hi!
180,Ross," You’re never gonna believe it uh, Monica and Chandler are moving in
again. That’s great news right—I mean for them. Right?"
181,Rachel, Oh wow.
182,Ross," Yeah but, on the bright side, we get to be roommates again."
183,Rachel," Yeah. Y’know umm, uh, umm, about that, umm, Ross I really
appreciate your offer to let me move in and everything, but don’t you think it’s
gonna be weird?"
184,Ross," Wh-why?! Why-why-why would it, why would it be weird?"
185,Rachel," Well, because of us! Because of our history."
186,Ross, No!
187,Rachel, No?
188,Ross," No! No! It would be weird if we were still in that place, I mean are you
still in that place?"
189,Rachel, No! Not at all!
190,Ross," Good! Me neither! So it’s not a problem. We’re just two friends
who happen to be roommates."
191,Rachel," Okay, but Ross, eventually you and I are gonna be dating."
192,Ross, Really?! We are?
193,Rachel," Yeah! I’m gonna have a boyfriend, you’re gonna have a
girlfriend…"
194,Ross, Ohh! That would be great.
195,Rachel," But y’know what, if you think it’s gonna be okay we’ll
just work out a system. Y’know, it’ll be like college, I’ll hang a hanger
on the door and put a sign, ""Come back later, I’m gettin’ lucky.""
(Laughs.)"
196,Ross," (laughs as well, but for a different reason) Yeah, I didn’t think of
that."
198,Ross," So are you sure about this whole moving in thing?! I mean it’s a really
big step! And-and what’s the rush?!"
200,Monica, That’s very funny!
201,Chandler," He’s being silly, because he knows that we enjoy the silliness!"
202,Ross," No, I-I-I’m serious, okay? I mean, think about it. You move in, you
start fighting over stupid game rooms, next thing y’know you break up!"
203,Monica," Ross, you were right before, it was just a stupid fight about a room."
204,Ross," Okay, there are no stupid fights!! This isn’t about the room, this is
about what the room…represents! And unfortunately, this room (Points to Rachel’s
room) could destroy you!!"
205,Chandler," Yeah, I'm not so worried."
206,Monica," Yeah, no, me neither."
207,Ross," Fine! It’s your life! (Starts to storm out mad about his failed
attempt at the manipulation of his best friend and sister, but stops and tries one last
time.) I just don’t want to see you guys break up! Which you will do if you
move in together, (Monica and Chandler just stare at him.) but that’s what you want,
there’s nothing I can do. (Opens the door and tries one more time.) DON’T DO
IT!!!!! (Finally leaves.)"
208,Monica, You still want to move in together right?
209,Chandler, Of course!
210,Monica, Ross didn’t scare you?
211,Chandler, Scared me out of ever wanting to live with him.
212,Monica," Come here, I want to show you something!"
213,Chandler, Okay!
215,Chandler, Oh my God! Someone’s killed Square Man!
216,Monica," This is where I thought the barca lounger could go! You see you could
see the TV and it’s still walking distance to the kitchen."
217,Chandler, Oh that’s so sweet! I want to show you something too!
218,Monica, Okay!
219,Chandler," Y’know those big-big uh, road signs that say ""Merge?"""
220,Monica, Uh-hmm.
221,Chandler," Y’know? So I was thinking that we could get one of those signs
and hang it over our bed. Because, that’s you and I together! Merge!"
222,Monica, Oh my God! I love that!
223,Chandler, Really?!
224,Monica," Uh, no!!"
226,Phoebe," (singing) I found you in my bed! 
                         
How’d you whined up there? 
                         
You are a mystery!
                         
Little black curly hair!
                         
Little black curly hair!
                         
Little black, little black, little black, little black, little black curly
hair…………"
228,Phoebe," Now if you want to receive e-mails about my upcoming shows, then please
give me money so I can buy a computer."
229,Ross," (To Rachel) So umm, where are the other guys?"
230,Rachel," Umm, well let’s see Monica and Chandler are occupied."
231,Ross, Fighting?!
232,Rachel," No, the other thing. I really think it’s great they work things
out."
233,Ross," Yeah. There’s no breaking them up, is there?"
234,Rachel," Hey, can I borrow the key to your house so I can run across the street
and make a copy?"
235,Ross, Sure! Here. (Hands her his keys.)
236,Rachel," Thank you. (Gets up) Now are you sure? Because once I make a copy,
there’s no turning back."
237,Ross," Yeah, I’m-I’m sure. (Deadpan) Yeah, get out of here before I
change my mind. (She exits)"
238,Joey," Umm, listen, Ross do you really think this moving in with Rachel is a good
idea?"
239,Ross, I’ve been back and forth.
240,Joey," Yeah well, maybe you should go back! Okay? Rachel moves in, and before you
know it you’re right where you don’t want to be! Back together!"
241,Ross," Ehh, I don’t, I don’t think so. She’s already talked about
y’know, dating other guys."
242,Joey," That’s not gonna work out! Then she’s gonna come home all weepy
and you’ll be tellin’ her, ""Oh that’s okay. You’ll find
someone."" And then, bamn! She finds you!"
243,Ross," Yeah, well, m-maybe you’re right."
244,Joey," I am telling you Ross, she is definitely gonna fall in love with you
again! Now, is that what you want?"
245,Ross, Is that what I want?
246,Phoebe," (on the microphone, accidentally) Yes."
248,Joey," Here she comes. Hold on, I’m gonna make your life much easier."
249,Rachel," All right, well the place was closed. I’ll just copy it later."
250,Joey," Or not. Uh, Rach, why don’t you just move in with me? (Rachel sighs.)"
251,Ross," Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, Joey!"
252,Joey," No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no… It’s okay, I mean I—look Rach, I
know I scared you off with that whole Naked Thursday’s thing, but we don’t have
to do that!"
253,Rachel," Well, it would be easier to move just right across the hall. Wait a
minute, unless you’re thinking about Naked Wednesday’s."
254,Joey," Thursday’s clearly not good for ya, pick a day!"
257,Joey, (opening the door to The Potential Roommate) Hi!
259,Joey," Come in. Thanks for comin’ back, umm, okay there have been a lot of
people interested in the room, but I have narrowed it down and you are one of the
finalists!"
261,Joey," Okay now, before I make my final decision I uh, I just want to make sure
our personalities match. Okay, so I made up a little test. Now, I’m gonna say a word
and then you say the first thing that comes to mind."
263,Joey, Okay! Here we go. Pillow.
265,Joey, Very good! Okay. G.
267,Joey," Excellent! Okay umm, doggy."
269,Joey," Ooh, sorry! No-no-no, so close though, but—bye-bye! (He ushers her
out the door.)"
0,Rachel," So, which of this kitchen stuff is mine?"
1,Monica, This bottle opener. (She grabs it off of the freezer door.)
2,Rachel, And?
3,Monica, And it’s a magnet!
4,Rachel, Look at that!
5,Ross," How weird is that? Y’know? You’re moving in with me and have the
one thing I don’t have. It’s like uh, in a way you-you complete me
(Phoebe glares at him) kitchen."
6,Rachel, What?!
7,Ross," (in an Australian accent) You complete me kitchen, matey!"
8,Phoebe," Ross, I know what you’re thinking."
9,Ross, What?
10,Phoebe," That she’s gonna move in with you and maybe then she’ll fall
in love with you and then when she finds out you’re already married, she’ll just
be happy. Y’know? You’re just, you’re very sad."
11,Ross," Oh…my…God! I-I see what this is! You are in love with
Rachel!"
12,Phoebe, What?!!
13,Ross," Of course! It all adds up! I mean you you’re obsessed with her.
It’s always, ""Ross, what are you gonna do about Rachel?"" ""Ross,
why-why are you moving in with Rachel?"" ""When are you gonna confess your secret
marriage to Rachel?"" You want her!"
14,Phoebe, No! (Ross’s phone rings.)
15,Ross," (answering it) Uh-oh, saved by the bell. (On phone) Hello?"
17,Monica," Hey Rach, aren’t these candlesticks (holds up a pair) mine?"
18,Rachel," No-no, I bought those."
19,Monica," Ohh! Yeah, I forgot."
20,Rachel, Yeah. (Rachel walks away.)
21,Monica," (under her breath) That you’re a liar. (Hides the candlesticks in a
drawer.)"
22,Ross," (on phone) No-no-no, that’s great! I’ll be there Monday. And
thank you again! (Listens) Okay. (Hangs up) (To All) Umm, that was the head of the
Paleontology department at N uh, Y, uh U!"
23,Monica," Wow! Uh what, did he uh, say?"
24,Ross," Well remember that paper I had published last year on sediment flow rate,
huh? They loved it. "
25,Rachel," Well, who wouldn’t?!"
26,Ross," I know! Anyway, they asked me to be a guest lecturer! I mean it’s
temporary, but uh, if they like me it could lead to a full time job. How great would that
look great on a mailbox, huh? ""Professor Geller."""
27,Phoebe," Yeah, Professor and Mrs."
28,Rachel, And Mrs.?!
29,Phoebe," Oh! Yeah, y’know you and Ross are still married."
30,Rachel, What?!!
31,Phoebe, Just kidding!
32,Rachel, Ohh! Oh God! (Laughs her way into the living room.) 
33,Phoebe, (To Ross) Saved your ass.
36,Chandler, Hey!
37,Phoebe, Hi.
38,Monica, Hey!
39,Chandler," Oh, what’s the matter?"
40,Phoebe," Well, you know that psychic I see?"
41,Chandler, Yeah?
42,Phoebe," Well, she told me that I’m gonna die this week, so I’m kinda
bummed about that."
43,Chandler, What?!
44,Phoebe," Yeah, and I know you guys don’t know a lot about psychic readings,
but that one is pretty much the worse one you can get."
45,Monica, Phoebe that’s crazy!
46,Joey, I can’t believe she would say that too you.
47,Rachel, Yeah honey you don’t believe her do you?
48,Phoebe," I don’t—she said y’know that I’d have triplets! But
she also said one of them would be black."
49,Chandler, Just out of curiosity did she tell you how you’re gonna go?
50,Phoebe," No, ‘cause she didn’t tell me I was gonna die until the very
end of the session, and I was not gonna waste a whole another hour there! I mean I’ve
only got a week left, y’know? I’ve really gotta start living now! (So she
picks up the latest copy of Car and Driver (a U.S. auto magazine), leans back, and
starts reading.)"
51,Ross, (entering) Hey everyone!
52,Chandler, Oh hi!
53,Ross," Hey uh, well, today’s my first lecture and I kinda wanted to try it
out on you guys, do you, do you mind?"
56,Ross," (he starts reading directly from his cards word for word very quietly)
""There are three primary theories concerning sediment flow rate. Each of these
theories can be further subcategorized into two distinct…"""
57,Phoebe," Oh, this is it. This what’s gonna kill me."
58,Ross," (continuing) ""…subcategories. The first of these subcategories
is…"""
59,Joey," (interrupting him) Uh Ross! Are there uh, are there naked chicks on that
piece of paper?"
60,Ross, No! Why?
61,Joey," Well, I’ve just never seen a guy stare so hard at a piece of paper
that didn’t have naked chicks on it."
62,Ross," Ohh! Okay! Okay. (Resumes reading word for word from the card) ""There
are three (pauses and looks at Joey) primary theories concerning sediment flow rate.
(Pauses and darts his eyes between Chandler and Rachel.) (Rachel starts laughing) Each of
these theories (glances at Phoebe) can be further subcategorized (glances at Chandler)
into…"""
63,Chandler, Why don’t you open with a joke?
64,Ross," Open with a joke? It’s a university, not a comedy club!"
65,Chandler," Wait a minute, hold the phone! You’re not talking about
Chuckles University?!"
66,Ross, (gets up) Okay!
68,Rachel," Ross, hey you know what might make it less boring?"
69,Ross, Thank you!
70,Rachel," Some uh, some visual aides."
71,Joey, Oh-ooh-ooh! Y’know what’s a good visual aide?
72,Ross, Please don’t say naked chicks.
73,Joey, Why not?!
74,Ross," I-I-I don’t even know why I bother to talk to you guys about it.
Y’know what? I’m just gonna do it on my own with no naked chicks."
75,Chandler, That’s the way I did it ‘til I was 19.
77,Chandler, Hey.
78,Joey, Hey! Any good mail?
79,Chandler," Yes, you got something from the Screen Actor’s Guild."
80,Joey," Ooh, it’s probably a residual check, hey can you open it for me,
I’m kinda…."
81,Chandler," (opens and reads it) ""Benefits lapsed."""
82,Joey," Hmm that’s weird. I don’t remember being in a move called
benefits lapsed."
83,Chandler," Okay, it’s not a check. They’re saying your health insurance
expired because, you didn’t work enough last year."
84,Joey, Let me see that!
85,Chandler, All right.
86,Joey," (reads it) Oh, I can’t believe this! This sucks! When I had insurance
I could get hit by a bus or catch on fire, y’know? And it wouldn’t matter. Now I
gotta be careful?!"
87,Chandler," I’m sorry man, there’s never a good time to (pauses) stop
catching on fire."
88,Joey," All right well, I guess I gotta go get a job. I’m gonna go see my
agent."
89,Chandler," Okay, make sure you look both ways before you cross the street."
90,Joey," (mocks him, in a whiney voice) …look both ways before you cross the
street. (Turns and walks headlong into the closed door.)"
92,Phoebe, Hey!
93,Rachel," Hey Pheebs, you’re still alive! How are you doing?"
94,Phoebe," Ugh, it’s so exhausting waiting for death. Ohh, by the way,
do you think you could—(Groans, hacks, and then freezes with her eyes open and her
tongue hanging out.)"
95,Rachel," Pheebs, what-what are you doing?"
96,Phoebe," I was preparing you for my—didn’t you think I was dead? Did
that not come off?"
97,Rachel," Oh yeah, scared the hell out of me. I thought we’d lost you
forever. Pheebs, you lie down?"
98,Phoebe," Yeah, thanks. And listen, can you do me a favor? Could you just umm,
wake me up in a couple hours, y’know if you can."
100,Rachel, Monica!
101,Monica, Hmm? (Rachel holds up the candlesticks.)
102,Rachel, Did-did you take these back?
103,Monica," No-no, I-I just, I liked them so much that I went out and bought some
for myself."
104,Rachel," Oh yeah, they’re really great! Aren’t they?"
105,Monica, I loved them!
106,Rachel, Yeah. (Monica walks away) Nice try! (Rachel puts them in a box.)
107,Ross, (entering) Hello!
108,Monica, Hey!
109,Rachel, Hey!
110,Monica, How’d the lecture go?
111,Ross, It went great! And I didn’t need any jokes or naked chicks either!
112,Rachel," Wow, that’s great Ross, I’m sorry we weren’t more
supportive before."
113,Ross," I knew all I had to do was let the material speak for itself.
Everyone’s all, ""Ross you have to be funny and sexy."" Well, I proved them
wrong! And now, I’m gonna pass the news onto Joey and Chandler."
114,Monica, That you’re not funny or sexy?
115,Ross, That’s right!
117,Joey," (entering) Hey Estelle, listen…"
119,Joey," What are you talkin’ about? I never left you! You’ve always been
my agent!"
121,Joey, Yeah!
123,Joey," Estelle, you gotta get me some work. I-I lost my health insurance."
125,Joey, Why?
127,Joey, Bastard!
129,Chandler, Hey!
130,Joey," (in obvious pain) Hey! So Estelle lined up a bunch of auditions for me
tomorrow and I’ll have my health insurance back in no time."
131,Chandler," That’s great, but shouldn’t you be on the toilet right now?"
132,Joey, What?!
133,Chandler, What’s wrong with you?
134,Joey," Nothing! Well, I-I got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting
weights before, then I uh passed out and uh, haven’t been able to stand up since. But
um, I don’t think it’s anything serious."
135,Chandler, This sounds like a hernia. You have to—you-you go to the doctor!
136,Joey," No way! ‘Kay look, if I have to go to the doctor for anything
it’s gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach! (Rolls over and shows
Chandler.)"
137,Chandler, That’s a hernia.
138,Joey," Why did I have to start working out again? (Looks at the weights he was
using.) Damn you 15s!"
140,Rachel," Well, we’re a little early, the lecture doesn’t end for 15
minutes."
141,Monica," Yeah, but y’know we could sneak in and watch."
142,Rachel," Yeah, we could. Oh hey look! There’s some Kappa Kappa Deltas! I was
a Kappa. (to them) Hey sisters! (They ignore her.) (To Monica) Wow, we really are bitches."
144,Ross," (to the class) Right! So when Rigby got his samples back from the
laboratory he made a startling discovery! What he believed to be igneous, was in fact
sedimentary. Imagine his consternation when—(sees Monica and Rachel.) Oh bloody hell."
147,Monica, What the hell are you doing?!
148,Ross," Look, I was nervous! You guys had me all worried I was going to be boring!
I got up there and they were all like staring at me. I opened my mouth and this British
accent just came out."
149,Rachel," Yeah, and not a very good one."
150,Ross, Will you-will you please?
153,Ross, Oh.
155,Ross," (in his British accent) I’m sorry, I’ve got plans with my
sister."
156,Monica, (in an Irish accent) Monica Gellerrr. (She rolls her ‘R’)
157,Ross," (in accent) Right, will you excuse us for one moment? (Takes Monica
aside.) (In his normal voice.) What are you doing?"
158,Monica," (normal voice) Oh, you can have an accent and I can’t?! (To an
exiting student in accent.) Top ‘O the morning to ya laddies!"
159,Ross, Just please stop!
161,Rachel," (in an Indian accent) Yes, yes, Bombay is bery, bery nice time of year."
163,Chandler," Hey, will you grab me a cruller? (Joey starts to groan and get up.)
Sit down! Will you go to the hospital?!"
164,Joey," Dude! Hernia operations cost like, a lot probably. Besides it’s
getting darker and more painful, that means it’s healing."
165,Chandler," I will loan you the money. Just go to the hospital and let’s just
get that thing…pushed back in."
166,Joey," Thank you, but it would take me forever to pay you that money back and I
don’t want that hanging over my head. Okay? Besides, as soon as my insurance kicks in
I can get all the free operations I want! Yeah, I’m thinking I’ll probably start
with that laser eye surgery too."
168,Phoebe, Hey!
169,Chandler, Hey.
170,Joey, Hey!
171,Phoebe, What’s going on?
172,Chandler," Oh Joey’s got a really bad hernia, but that’s nothing a
little laser eye surgery won’t fix!"
173,Joey," Look, I’m telling you if I put my hand on my stomach right here (He
puts his hand down his pants, like Al Bundy on Married…With Children always
used to do.) it doesn’t hurt that bad."
174,Phoebe, Hey! Maybe you’ll die!
175,Joey," Sure, now I’m scared."
176,Phoebe," No, we can go together! Just don’t wait too long though, okay?
‘Cause I’m outta here sometime before Friday."
177,Joey," Yeah, but I don’t wanna die!"
178,Phoebe," No-no, it’ll be fun! We can come back and we can haunt these guys!"
180,Monica, Gimme ‘em!
181,Rachel, No! They are mine!
182,Monica, You stole them from me!
183,Rachel, You stole them from me!!
184,Monica, Gimme them!
186,Monica, You just wanna each take one?
187,Rachel, Yeah that seems fair. We never use them.
188,Ross," (entering) Look, I really need some help, okay? Why? Why did I have to
speak in a British accent?! What do I do?"
189,Rachel, Well…
190,Monica," Why don’t you phase it out? Yeah, fade the accent out and people
will think you’re, y’know, that you’re adjusting to life in America."
191,Rachel," Yeah, I mean, come on Ross, no one will even notice. I mean they’re
probably not even listening!"
192,Ross, They’re not listening too me?
193,Rachel, Of course they’re listening to you! Everybody listens to you.
194,Ross, Monica you really think I should try this phasing out thing?
195,Monica, I think you look fine.
198,Joey," (in a gravely, painful voice) Okay. ""Hey, Timmy, I’ve got a
surprise for you."""
200,Joey," Oh yeah, sure, no problem, I’ll just—hold on one second. (He
turns around and puts his hand in his pants and groans in relief.) (In a relaxed voice.)
""Hey Timmy, I’ve got a surprise for you!"""
204,Joey," So that’s why I feed my dog Purina One! Pick up a bag today!
(He turns, looks at the bag and realizes he won’t be able to pick it up.)"
206,Joey, Exactly.
208,Joey," Or, I could just point to it! Huh? Blah, blah, blah, Purina One,
point to a bag today. (She just looks at him.) I didn’t get it, did I?"
210,Joey," Yeah, okay. (Leaves)"
212,Joey, Hi. I’m Joey Tribbiani; I’m here to audition for (Groans) man.
214,Joey, Yes!
216,Monica," Okay, come on, do it one more time!"
217,Rachel, Really? Really?!
218,Monica, Yes!
219,Rachel," Okay! (Picks up the phone and starts dialing.) (In an Irish accent)
""Hello Ross, this is Dr. McNeeley from the Fake Accent University, we’d like you
to come on board with us full time! (Hangs up.)"
220,Phoebe, (entering) Hey!
221,Rachel, Hey!
222,Phoebe," Listen to this! My reading was wrong, I’m not going die!"
223,Rachel, Really?! How do you know?
224,Phoebe, Because my psychic is dead! She must’ve read the cards wrong!
225,Rachel," Oh, I’m sorry."
226,Phoebe," Eh, better her than me! Hey, let’s bake cookies!"
228,Chandler," Listen, I’m really glad you got the part."
229,Joey, (barely audible through the pain) Thank you.
230,Chandler, But are you sure you can do this?
231,Joey," Yeah! And hey, thanks for coming with me. And thanks again for helping me
take a shower."
233,Chandler," Now, is that never talking about it again?!"
234,Joey, (to the director) Hiya!
236,Joey," Hi Alex! (to the director) And uh, as you can see my hands are not in my
pants. (Holds them both up.)"
241,Joey," ""Take could care of your Momma son."" (Alex just looks at him and
the director motions for him to continue so he tries it again.) ""Take could care of
your Momma son."" (Alex does nothing.) ""Come on son! Your Momma’s good
people!"""
249,Joey," Ah, just one thing umm, is it all right with you if I, if I scream right
up until you say action?"
251,Joey, Okay. (Starts screaming.)
253,Joey," (he stops screaming at action) ""Take good care of your Momma
son."" (Again Alex does nothing.)"
256,Chandler," I’m sorry! Hey-hey Joe, why don’t you uh, lift up your
shirt? (He does.) Take a look at this kiddo. (Alex finally starts crying.) We
have a crying child! Roll the damn cameras!"
258,Rachel, (answering it) Hello? 
260,Rachel," Uh no, he’s not. Can I take a message?"
262,Rachel, Ross got married again—Nooooooo!!!!!!!!!
264,Ross," (in his head) All right, keep going. We are phasing the accent out,
phasing it out. So without out re-testing the results in the laboratory (pronounced
the British way) the team would never have identified (British) the initial errors in
their carbon dating analysis (British). Were there any questions at this point? (One
student raises his hand.) Yes. (Points to him.)"
266,Ross," (British) Come again? What’s-what’s this nonsense? (Giggles.)
(American.) All right, I’m-I’m not English. I’m from Long Island. I was
really nervous and the accent just uh, just came out. I’m sorry. So, if we could just
get back to the lecture. Umm, were there any questions? (Everyone raises their hands)
About paleontology. (They all put their hands down.) All right, look I was just trying to
make a good first impression. Obviously, I screwed up. But what you guys think of me is
really important because I’m-I’m hoping to get a permanent job here. So if you
just give me another chance to make a good impression…"
268,Rachel," Ross!! Are you crazy?! I am still your wife!! What, were you just
never gonna tell me?!! What the hell is wrong with you?!!!! Ugh, I could just kill you!!!!"
269,Ross," (in the accent again) Well, hello Rachel!"
272,Phoebe, Have you really done this before?
273,Joey," Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! You just take a big, big swing. Now, don’t hold
back. (He dons his protective helmet (Why, I have no clue.) and Phoebe picks up a wooden
baseball bat and starts to swing as Chandler and Monica enter.)"
274,Phoebe, Hey!
275,Joey, Hey-hey-hey!
276,Chandler, What are you doing?
277,Phoebe, We’re just celebrating that Joey got his health insurance back.
278,Chandler," Oh, all right."
0,Rachel," I cannot believe that you didn’t tell me that we are still
married!!"
1,Ross, Look I was going to tell you!
2,Rachel," When?! After the birth of our first secret child?! (To All) Ross
didn’t get the annulment; we are still married."
3,Chandler, What?
4,Monica, You’re kidding!
5,Phoebe, (overdoing it) Oh my God!!
6,Monica, Ross!
7,Ross," Okay, maybe it wasn’t my best decision. But I just couldn’t face
another failed marriage."
8,Chandler," Okay, let me just jump in and ask, at what point did you think this
was a successful marriage?"
9,Ross," Rach, come on, if you think about it, it’s actually kinda funny. (He
laughs, and he laughs alone.) Okay, maybe it’s best not to think about it."
10,Phoebe," Okay, this is inexcusable. I am shocked to my very core!"
11,Ross," Phoebe, I told her you already knew."
12,Phoebe, Another lie. You have a sickness!
13,Chandler," Ross, just for my own piece of mind, you’re not married to
anymore of us are ya?"
16,Joey," Oh! Hey, somebody left their keys. (Looks at them) Ooohh, to a Porsche!
{Transcriber’s note Oh come on! Who would leave the keys to their Porsche behind? If
I had a Porsche, I’d have the keys surgically attached to my hand!} Hey Gunther,
these yours?"
18,Joey, Na-uh! (To everyone there) Hey did anybody lose their keys?
19,Monica," Joey, why don’t you put them in the lost and found?"
20,Joey," There’s a lost and found? (Gunther sets the box up on the table.) My
shoe! (Grabs it out of the box.)"
21,Chandler, You left a shoe here?!
22,Joey," Well, I didn’t realize until I got home. I wasn’t gonna walk all
the way back down here with one shoe! Y’know what? I’m gonna go find that
guy’s car and leave a note on the windshield. (Goes to do so.)"
23,Chandler," Oh good, when he comes back for his keys, I’ll be sure to give
him your shoe."
24,Joey, Great! Thanks. (Exits.)
25,Phoebe," (coming in from the bathroom) Oh, good, good, you guys are here! Listen,
how would like to spend tomorrow taking care of three incredibly cute little puppies?!"
26,Monica," Oh my God, what a fun day! That sounds great!"
27,Chandler," (not enthused) Yeah, all right."
28,Phoebe," Okay, well I’ll bring them by tomorrow morning. Okay, and uh, by
the way, they’re not actually puppies, they’re Frank and Alice’s triplets.
Okay, see ya! (Exits.)"
29,Chandler, Whoa-whoa-whoa! What?
30,Phoebe," (stops) Please! Please! Please! Please! Oh please! Please! Please! Frank
and Alice asked me to baby sit the triplets and I’m nervous ‘cause I’ve
never done that before by myself!"
31,Monica," Don’t worry about it Phoebe, we’ll absolutely do it."
32,Chandler," Yeah, I’m gonna pass. ‘Cause I was kinda iffy when it was
puppies."
33,Monica," Come on Chandler, come on! It’ll give us great practice for
when—(realizes what she’s about to say and changes)—people with babies come
to visit."
36,Joey," Yeah, it’s not mine."
38,Joey," Yeah, it’s (looks up and sees the woman) mine."
40,Joey," Me too! Yeah. And comfortable. Do uh, do you like leather seats?"
42,Joey, (checks in the window to make sure it has them) It’s got ‘em!
44,Rachel," So, I still have boxes here. I still have boxes at Ross’s, and
I have nowhere to live! Wow. I could so easily freak out right now."
45,Phoebe," What about me? I just found out that Denise is leaving town for a while,
I don’t have a roommate."
46,Rachel," Well, maybe-maybe I could be your roommate Pheebs."
47,Phoebe, Maybe you could be my roommate!
48,Rachel, Well there’s an idea!!
49,Phoebe, Yeah!
50,Rachel," That would be great! Wait, how long is Denise gone for?"
51,Phoebe," Umm, she said she’d be back December 26th. "
52,Rachel," December 26th, huh maybe she’s Santa Clause."
54,Rachel," (deadpan) Oh look who it is, my husband. The apple of my eye."
55,Ross," Okay, I got us a court date for tomorrow at 200 and I picked up all the
forms. I’ll take care of everything."
56,Rachel," Well sure, if you say you’re gonna take care of everything I have
no reason to doubt you. Give me those forms! (Grabs them from him.) All right, now
I’m gonna do this my way and I don’t want to hear a peep out of you!"
57,Ross," Okay Rach, but…"
58,Rachel, Op! You’re peeping!
60,Rachel," Ross! Y’know what, I just got—why? Why did you do this?!"
61,Ross, Look I told you…
62,Rachel," I don’t wanna hear ""Three failed marriages!"""
63,Ross," Look, if you’d had two failed marriages, you’d understand!"
64,Rachel," Well, y’know what? Thanks to you I’m half way there! Ugh! Oh!
I am so mad! Ross, I don’t think I have ever been this angry!"
65,Ross, What about the time I said we were on a break?
66,Rachel, Ugh! (Stares at him.)
68,Monica," Pheebs, how’s it going?"
69,Phoebe," (rapidly) I’m doing okay. I think it’s going well. Do you
think they’re having fun? Am I talking to fast?"
70,Monica," Nope, sound like me. Pheebs, it’s going great. Look at Chandler
with little baby girl Chandler."
71,Chandler," Little baby girl Chandler, where I have heard that before? Oh right,
Coach Ruben. (Tries to get her to drink a little more from the bottle when he suddenly
smells something. It’s times like these I’m glad Smell-O-Vision hasn’t been
invented.) Do you know what Pheebs? When you’re done over there, we kinda have a
situation over here too. (Phoebe is changing hers.)"
72,Phoebe," Na-uh, no, we are all responsible for our own babies."
73,Chandler," See that’s where I think that you’re wrong. We’ve been
playing these babies man for man; we should really be playing a zone defense."
74,Monica, What do you mean?
75,Chandler," I just think that things would go a lot smoother if we each have our
own zone. Phoebe, you can be in charge of wiping. And y’know Mon, you can be in
charge of diapering and I can be in charge of looking how cute they are when they put
their hands around… (He degrades into baby talk, but he means when they grab his
finger.)"
76,Phoebe," That sounds really great, but maybe you should be in charge of wiping."
77,Chandler," Okay, I’m a rookie. I should not be in the end zone."
79,Monica," This is so great! This is exactly how we set the plates at the
restaurant."
80,Phoebe, Yeah? (Checking the final diaper) Well this is not what I ordered.
81,Joey, (entering) Hey guys!
82,Chandler, Hey!
83,Phoebe, Hey!
84,Joey," Hey babies! Oh, I’m having the best morning. That uh, that Porsche
I’ve got the keys too, still there!"
85,Chandler, Shocking! Since you still have the keys.
86,Joey," You should see the treatment I get when I’m with that car! People are
friendly; they-they wanna talk, and not just about the car! One guy gave me advice about
my equity investments."
87,Chandler, What equity investments?
88,Joey," The ones that got me the Porsche! Will you keep up! (Chandler wipes his
forehead with a baby wipe, that might have been used. He drops it disgustedly.) But I
figured, if-if people keep seeing me just standing there, they’re gonna start to
think that I don’t own it. So I figured I’ll wash it. Right? Monica, you got a
bucket and some soap I can borrow?"
89,Monica," Oh yeah, I got soap and sponges and rags and Carnuba wax and polishing
compound."
90,Chandler, You don’t even have a car!
91,Monica," I know. But umm, one time there was this really dirty car in front of
the building, so I washed it."
92,Chandler, And?
93,Monica, And six others.
94,Chandler, There you are.
96,Joey," Yeah, she tops out at 130."
98,Joey," And that’s just in the city. I get her up to 160 when I take her
upstate."
100,Joey, Sure!
102,Joey," Okay, take it easy."
104,Joey," Really? Oh uh, oh just give me five more minutes with it."
106,Joey," Oh I-I uh, found the keys and now I’m just polishing her up."
108,Joey," Yeah, but it’s my wax."
110,Joey," Sure. Here. (He hands them over.) I’ll uh, save your parking spot."
112,Joey, Why not?
114,Joey," Yeah, so did I."
117,Phoebe," I don’t know why I was so nervous about this. And I don’t know
why Frank and Alice are always complaining. This is so easy."
118,Monica," Yeah, two hours, a lifetime that’s the same."
119,Chandler," (entering) Check it out! Check it out! When the babies wake up, they
can meet Krog! (He holds up this Xena-like warrior action figure.)"
120,Monica," Chandler, what are you doing? That thing can put someone’s eye out!"
121,Chandler, He can do more than that! He can destroy the universe!
122,Phoebe," No Chandler, they can swallow one of those little parts! And also, look
at his smooth area, that’s just gonna mess them up."
123,Chandler," They’re not gonna swallow anything, you guys are being way over
protective. When I was a kid, my mom used to just throw me into a pile of broken glass!"
124,Phoebe, What?!
125,Chandler," Glass, sand, whatever. (Walks out as Monica and Phoebe turn to check
on the babies again.)"
126,Phoebe," Oh, look at little Leslie stretching in her sleep."
127,Monica," Oh it’s so cute. I wonder what age it is when you stop being able
to put both legs over your head."
128,Phoebe," Oh, I can still do that."
129,Monica, How are you still single?!
130,Chandler," (entering) All right. (Clears throat) I thought about it and maybe
you’re right. Maybe Krog is not a safe toy."
131,Monica, Good. What made you change your mind?
132,Chandler, I swallowed the sonic blaster gun.
133,Phoebe, How did that happen?!!
134,Chandler," Well, I was trying to prove that I was right. Y’know? And it
turns out I was wrong. And now it’s lodged in my throat. (Mimics a cat trying to
cough up a hairball.) (He does it again.)"
135,Monica," Damnit! Y’know this whole time we were concentrating on watching
the babies and, and no one was watching Chandler! (He does it again.)"
138,Rachel," Yes your honor, and here are, are forms, all filled out."
140,Ross," Fine, I’m mentally unstable."
142,Ross, What?!
143,Rachel," Uh yes, heroin and crack."
144,Ross, Crack isn’t even an intravenous drug!
145,Rachel," Well, you would know."
147,Ross," Oh, come on!"
148,Rachel," (starts to cry) Ross, please, I found the magazines!"
150,Ross," Okay, I’m sorry, this is insane! I-I-I’m not addicted to heroin,
I’m not gay, and there is no problem with my ability to consummate anything!
Look, I’ll consummate this marriage right here, right now!"
152,Ross, And when we were dating we consummated like bunnies!
153,Rachel, Ugh!
155,Rachel," Ross! Your honor, rest assured relationship ended like two years ago!
(To the stenographer) And could you strike ""Consummated like bunnies"" from the
record?"
157,Rachel," Well, yes, we got married in Vegas and uh, and the names I think."
159,Ross," (stands up) That’s great! Are you happy now? Look what you did with
your funny, funny form!"
160,Rachel," (stands up as well) What?! Me?! What about you and your consummated like
bunnies nonsense!"
161,Ross," And what—(notices the stenographer is still typing)—What are you
typing that for? Did you hear what she said? We don’t get the annulment. Don’t
type that! What?! Stop typing! (He goes over to where the stenographer is typing and in
the process pushes Rachel out of his way.) Hey! Stop typing! (He’s still typing.)
Stop typing! Stop typing!!"
162,Rachel," (to the judge) Okay, do you see, do you see what you’re keeping me
married too?!"
164,Rachel," All right look lady here is the deal, I came here for an annulment and I
am not leaving here until I get one!"
165,Ross, Yeah!
167,Rachel, And thank you for your time. (They both beat a hasty retreat.)
170,Joey," (entering wearing nothing but Porsche clothes) So the Porsche guy took his
car back."
171,Chandler, But you found the keys to his clothes?
172,Joey," No. No, I just uh, I just loved the way it feels when everybody thinks I
own a Porsche."
173,Monica," And people will think you own a Porsche because you’re wearing the
clothes?"
174,Joey," Of course! Only an idiot would wear this stuff if you didn’t have the
car! Right?"
175,Chandler, That is true.
176,Phoebe," Yeah, but only a genius would swallow a sonic blaster gun."
177,Joey," Oh, I’ve been there. Yeah, I am gonna go drive my Porsche. (Starts to
leave.)"
178,Monica," Joey, you know you don’t actually have one."
179,Joey," Come on! What are you doing?! I’m in character! Would you talk to
her! (Storms out.)"
180,Chandler," Ahh, I think it just moved. It’s really poking me."
181,Monica," All right, that’s it, we’re going to the emergency room."
182,Phoebe," What?! No, you can’t, you can’t leave me here with them!
We’re baby-sitting! "
183,Monica," The babies are asleep, I’m sure you’ll be okay on your own for
a while!"
184,Phoebe," But you-you can’t leave me with them! We-we’re a team!
We’re playing a zone! They’re gonna triple team me!"
185,Monica," He’s got something plastic lodged in his throat, we’ve got to
go to the hospital."
186,Phoebe," But no, because a doctor won’t be able to help him, it’s just
gonna y’know naturally pass through his system in like seven years."
187,Chandler, I think that’s gum.
188,Phoebe, I’m pretty sure it’s gun.
189,Chandler," Okay, listen this really hurts. Let’s go."
190,Phoebe," A real man wouldn’t just run to the hospital! (They don’t
stop.) No! What would, what would Krog do? (They ignore her and Phoebe is left alone.)"
192,Joey, Why isn’t that valet back with my Porsche?
194,Joey, (to women passing him) Porsche.
196,Rachel, This is totally your fault!
197,Ross, My fault?! You threatened the judge!
198,Rachel," Well, you ripped the paper out of the court reporter’s machine!!"
199,Ross, That was the only way I could get him to stop typing!
200,Joey, Hi! How are the Gellers? 
201,Rachel, Don’t call us that! (Storms away)
202,Ross," The judge wouldn’t let us get an annulment! Now we gotta get a
divorce!! Did a Porsch throw up on you? (Walks on.)"
203,Joey, Hey! It’s Porsche!! (He’s right y’know.)
205,Phoebe," Me taking care of you is no problem, huh? You guys feel safe. Right?
Okay, I’m gonna take that spit bubble as, ""Yeah, I do!"" Okay, after I get
rid of this dirty diaper Leslie, I’ll set you up with a clean one. (She throws it at
the garbage without looking, misses, and knocks over a vase and flowers, which fall to the
floor and break.) Okay, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to scare you. I just have to
clean that up. Okay? ‘Cause let’s face it, we’re at Monica’s. (She
crawls over, disposes of the diaper, picks up the flowers, and the vase.) I broke it. All
right. Well, that’s just the way that goes. (She throws out both the flowers and the
vase.) Okay, good. (She turns around and only counts two babies.) Why are there only two
of you? Where is Leslie? Well, you can’t answer. (She starts looking for her) Leslie?
Where are you Leslie? Leslie, now would be a good time for your first words! (She
turns around and finds that Leslie has managed to crawl into the bottom drawer of the TV
cabinet.) Well, look at you! Hey! You are a little bit mischievous! My gosh! (She picks
her up and notices a surprise is waiting in the drawer.) Oh, you’re a lot
mischievous! Well, it’ll dry. (Closes the drawer with her foot.) (To Leslie) Okay,
you sit with your brother and sister now—who aren’t there! (They both have
disappeared as well.)"
207,Chandler, (entering) Hey!
208,Phoebe, (exhausted) How do you feel?
209,Chandler," Well, let’s just say that Krog will be fully equipped to destroy
the universe again in twelve to fourteen hours."
210,Phoebe," Okay, so I totally took care of the babies all by myself! I fed
‘em, bathed ‘em, and put ‘em to bed."
211,Chandler, And protected them from a tornado?
213,Monica, Oh my God.
214,Phoebe," I know, the babies are asleep."
215,Monica," Phoebe, what, what happened here?!"
216,Phoebe, I did it! I took care of the babies all by myself!
217,Monica, But my apartment!
218,Chandler, Was the setting of Phoebe’s triumph.
219,Monica, But the mess!
220,Chandler," Is not as important as the fact that Phoebe took care of the babies
all by herself."
221,Monica," You’re right, you’re right I shouldn’t freak out.
‘Cause this is what will happen when you and I have babies! When will that be?!"
222,Chandler," (pause) Phoebe, would you take a look at this mess!!!!"
224,Rachel," (deadpan) Oh honey thank God you’re home, I was getting worried."
225,Ross," I picked up the divorce papers. Uh, I’ve already signed everything
and I put little ‘X’s where you need to sign."
226,Rachel," Oh, little ‘X’s! Great! That makes up for everything!"
227,Ross," Y’know, I-I—you’ve done a lot of stupid stuff too! Okay?"
228,Rachel," Oh, name one stupid thing that is as stupid as this one!"
229,Ross," Okay, how about you flew to London to stop my wedding! Ah, how about you
told me you loved me after I was already married!"
230,Rachel," Hey! Wait a minute! That was different! I did those things because I was
in love with you!"
231,Ross, Yeah! Right!
233,Ross," You’re right. That’s very different. So let’s, let’s
just sign the papers. All right? (Sits down and Rachel keeps standing there.) What?"
234,Rachel, Nothing. (Sits down.)
235,Ross," Okay, can we just sign please?"
236,Rachel," Uh-hmm. (Just as Rachel finishes signing her name, Ross yanks each page
out of the way.)"
237,Ross, Congratulations. (Gets up to leave.)
238,Rachel," Okay Ross, we’re—wait a minute. Umm, I uh, I kinda have a
little confession."
239,Ross, What?
240,Rachel," Well, y’know this whole marriage thing, kinda my idea."
241,Ross, Excuse me?
242,Rachel," Well, remember how we were too drunk to remember anything the night we
were married?"
243,Ross, Yeah?
244,Rachel," And uh, yeah, I didn’t really, I didn’t want to say anything,
but it kinda it just, it kinda kept coming back to me, and umm, remember we were in the
casino and for some reason thought it would be funny to eat a lot of grapes. And uh, and I
thought it would be funnier if we got married. So as a, as a compromise we decided first
to get married, and then (Ross joins in) to eat a lot of grapes. So umm, sorry I got us
into this mess."
245,Ross," So then if-if—I mean if you think about it, this is all (Pause.) your
fault."
246,Rachel," Yeah, don’t push it though."
247,Ross," I’ve got to say; I know I divorce a lot of women, never thought I
would be divorcing you."
248,Rachel," I know. I always thought if you and I got married, it would be the one
that stuck. And it wouldn’t be a secret, and we wouldn’t have our wedding dinner
at Pizza Hut. (They both laugh.)"
249,Ross," Did I, did I even treat?"
250,Rachel," No, it was on the house, it was, it was a newlywed special."
251,Ross," That may be the most depressing thing I’ve heard in my life. I should
probably get these to my lawyer’s office."
252,Rachel," Hey, thanks Ross, for taking care of all of this."
253,Ross," Eh, no problem."
255,Rachel, I’m gonna need a copy of those.
256,Ross, Totally. (Exits.)
259,Joey, Hey! Hey! Be careful around my Porsche! 
261,Joey, Hey! How you doin’?
263,Joey," I’d love to show ya, but I just tucked her in. She’s sleeping.
(The women both laugh) Hey uh, would you two girls like to go for a drink? (Just then the
same guy with the football dives to make a catch, lands on the car cover, and collapses
it. It turns out that Joey set up a bunch of boxes to make it look like a Porsche.)"
0,Chandler," (watches Joey for a moment) Okay! (Joey quickly moves the hockey stick
so that he’s scratching his back with it.) Listen, I’m gonna be moving out so you
will be in charge of paying the rent."
1,Joey, Right! And when is that due?
2,Chandler, First of the month.
3,Joey, And that’s every month?
4,Chandler," No, just the months you actually want to live here."
5,Joey, Ahhh.
6,Chandler," Okay, here is the phone bill. (Hands it to Joey.)"
7,Joey, (looking at it) Oh my God!!
8,Chandler," That’s our phone number. Now look, I know I kinda sprung this
whole me moving out on thing, so why don’t I just—why don’t I just cover
you for a while?"
9,Joey, No-no! No way! Joey Tribbiani does not take charity…anymore.
10,Chandler," It’s not charity, Joe…"
11,Joey," No! Forget it! Okay—I mean thanks, but I’m done taking money
from you. All right, I can take of myself. Now, what’s next? Come on."
12,Chandler," Okay uh, here’s the electric bill. (Hands it to him.)"
13,Joey, This is how much we pay for electric?!!!
14,Chandler," Uh, yeah."
16,Chandler," So, we’ll do the rest of the bills later then?"
19,Phoebe, So is Joey going to have to give up the apartment?
20,Chandler," No, I hope not! I tried to offer him some money, but he wouldn’t
take it."
21,Phoebe," Well, how much do you think he needs?"
22,Chandler," I figure that $1,500 would cover him for a few months, y’know?
But I have to trick him into taking it so I won’t hurt his pride."
23,Phoebe," Why don’t you hire him as an actor? You could have him dress up and
put on little skits. Whatever you want."
24,Chandler, Well that would help the pride thing.
25,Monica, (entering from her room) Hey!
26,Chandler, Hey! Wow! You look great! Wanna move in with me tomorrow?
27,Monica, (thinks) Okay.
28,Chandler," Okay! (They kiss) So, what do you girls have planned for tonight?"
29,Monica," Well, instead of being sad that tonight is my last night together with
Rachel we thought we’d go out to dinner and celebrate the fact that Rachel is moving
in with Phoebe."
30,Phoebe," And also, my birthday."
31,Monica, It’s not your birthday.
32,Phoebe," What a mean thing to say! I would never tell you it’s not
your birthday!"
34,Joey, Hey!
35,Ross, Hey!
36,Chandler, Hey!
37,Phoebe, Hey! So you guys have anything planned for the big last night?
38,Chandler," Well, instead of just hanging out, we figure we’d do nothing."
39,Ross," Whoa-whoa-whoa, Knicks season opener tonight. I thought maybe you guys
would come over and watch it."
40,Joey," I don’t know Ross, not if you’re gonna talk about how you gave
up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist."
41,Ross, I did give up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist!
42,Rachel," (entering from her room) Pheebs, I was wondering…"
43,Monica," You’re not dressed yet?! We’re supposed to start having fun in
15 minutes!"
44,Rachel, Well and clearly not a minute sooner.
45,Monica," Rachel, you are packed though right, I mean please tell me that
you’re packed. "
46,Rachel," Of course I packed! Monica relax! I just wanted to ask Phoebe her
opinion on what I should wear tonight."
47,Phoebe," My God, I can’t get a minute of peace around this place."
49,Phoebe, Oh my God! Monica’s just gonna kill you.
50,Rachel," Yeah, yeah, I know."
51,Phoebe," Well, what you’re wearing is fine for that."
52,Monica," (entering) Rachel, I need to borrow—You’re not packed!!!!
You’re not packed even a little bit!"
53,Rachel, Surprise!!
54,Monica, What?
55,Rachel," No, no don’t get mad because look—this is what happened. So
I-I started packing, then I realized, ""What am I doing? I am lousy at packing!""
Right? But you love packing! So, as a gift to you, on our last night, ta-da!
"
56,Monica," (grabs a bag of those Styrofoam peanuts) I’ll be coordinator! Oh my
God! I’m so sorry, I didn’t get you anything! Okay, look everybody has to help!
Okay? You can help, can’t you Phoebe?"
57,Phoebe, I have plans.
58,Monica, You’re plans were with us.
59,Phoebe, That’s right.
60,Monica," All right, Chandler can make boxes, Ross can wrap, and Joey can lift
things. Now Phoebe, go tell the guys they have to help out!"
61,Phoebe, Okay.
62,Monica," Okay! (To Rachel) Oh my God, thank you!!"
64,Phoebe," Hurry! Monica’s gonna make you pack! She’s got jobs for
everyone! Now, it’s too late for me, but save your selves! (The guys scramble for the
door.)"
65,Monica," (entering and interrupting the guy’s escape attempt) Okay! The
movers will be here in 11 hours. Rachel has not packed. Now, everybody has to help!
Chandler, we’re gonna start with…"
66,Chandler," Oh nope, I-I have plans with Joey."
67,Monica, I thought you said you were going to do nothing.
68,Chandler," Yes, but for the last time."
69,Monica," Okay fine, now Ross…"
70,Ross," Oh, but-but I can’t do it."
71,Monica, Why not?
72,Joey, (quietly) I’ve got Ben.
73,Ross," Because, because I’ve got Ben."
74,Monica," It’s almost 8 o’clock, it’s almost past his bedtime.
Where-where is he?"
75,Chandler, He’s at a dinner party.
76,Monica, Is he really coming? Because I can see right into your apartment!
77,Ross," Of course he is! What, do you think I’d just use my son as-as an
excuse? What kind of father do you think I am?"
78,Monica," All right, sorry. (Goes back to Rachel’s room.)"
79,Ross, (to the guys) I gotta go make a fake Ben.
81,Joey, Here it is! Our last pizzas together as roommates.
82,Chandler," Oh, I wish I’d know you were going to do that, I ordered Chinese."
83,Joey," Oh that’s okay. Hey, actually in a way it’s kinda nice. Me,
bringing the food of my ancestors, you, the food of yours!"
85,Chandler," Say, Joe, I had a strange idea of what we could do for our last night.
What do you say we play a little uh, foosball for money?"
86,Joey," What, are you crazy? You haven’t beaten me once since my injury
plagued ’97 season. It would be easier if you just give me your money."
87,Chandler, Yes it would. What do you say to $50?
88,Joey," Okay, you’re on."
89,Chandler," Okay, let’s play! The big game, Italy vs. China, apparently."
92,Rachel," Ohhhhhh, look it’s the roller blades."
93,Monica, (starting to cry) Oh God!
94,Rachel, You remember when we got these?
95,Monica, No.
96,Rachel, I guess you weren’t there. (They hug.)
97,Phoebe," You guys, we said we were gonna have fun! Come on, hey, remember the
time… (She starts laughing hysterically.) You don’t remember?"
98,Rachel," I’m sorry Pheebs, I guess I’m just really said that I’m
leaving."
99,Monica, I’m gonna miss you so much.
100,Phoebe," Well, this doesn’t have to be so sad though. Y’know? Maybe
instead of just thinking about how much you’re gonna miss each other, you should like
think of the things you’re not gonna miss."
101,Monica, I don’t think there’s anything.
102,Phoebe," Come on, there’s gotta be something."
103,Monica," Nope, she’s perfect."
104,Rachel, I have one.
105,Phoebe, Good! Great! You can go first.
106,Rachel," Uh well, I guess I’m not gonna miss the fact that you’re never
allowed to move the phone pen. (Laughs. Monica lags behind the laugh a little bit.)"
107,Phoebe," Good that’s a good one. Okay, Monica, anything? Y’know? Does
Rachel move the phone pen?"
108,Monica," Aw, sometimes. Always, actually."
109,Phoebe," Okay, good. There you go. Doesn’t anyone feel better?"
110,Monica, Not just the phone pen. I never get my messages.
111,Rachel, You get your messages!
112,Monica," Yeah, well I don’t think it really counts if you have to read them
off the back of your hand after you fall asleep on the couch."
113,Rachel," So-so, you missed a message from who? Chandler or your mom? Or Chandler?
Or your mom?"
114,Phoebe, Great! It worked! No one’s sad.
116,Joey," (scores) Yes! I win again! Ha-ha! That’s like 500 bucks you owe me!
Whoo-ho-hoo! (Goes over to the fridge and starts opening and closing the door rapidly.)
$500 that is a loooot of electricity! (By the way, there’s nothing in the fridge.)
Whoo-ho-ho! (Notices the sparseness of the fridge.) I gotta buy some food."
117,Chandler," Okay, give me a chance to win my money back. Okay? Sudden death, one
goal, $1,000."
118,Joey, You serious?
119,Chandler, Oh yes!
120,Joey," Okay, get ready to owe me!"
121,Chandler, Okay.
122,Joey," Okay, here we go. Ready?"
124,Chandler, No! No! No! No—(Joey looks at him)—one can beat me.
126,Chandler," See? Now, that’s why only the little fake men are supposed to do
all the kicking."
128,Monica," Hello? (Listens) Oh, hi Ross! (To Rachel) See? Other people call me!"
129,Rachel," Ooh, your brother. Score!"
130,Monica, (on phone) What’s up?
131,Ross," Oh, I’m just over here with Ben. I thought we’d say hi."
132,Monica," Oh, put him on!"
133,Ross," Ben, say hi to Aunt Monica. (He holds the phone to the fake Ben he has
created out of a pumpkin.) Oh, I guess he doesn’t feel like talking right now.
He’s smiling though! Okay, talk to you later."
135,Phoebe," Yeah, I think it was better when you guys were sad. Hey, uh, remember
the roller blades?"
136,Rachel," You know what else I’m not gonna miss? ""I’m Monica. I
wash the toilet 17 times a day. Even if people are on it!"""
137,Monica," ""Hi I’m Rachel, is my sweater too tight? No? Oh, I’d
better wash it and shrink it!"""
138,Rachel," ""I’m Monica, I don’t get phone messages from interesting
people. Ever!"""
139,Phoebe, Hey! I call her!
140,Monica," ""Oh my God, I love Ross! I hate Ross! I love Ross! I hate
Ross!"""
141,Rachel," ""Oh my God, I can’t find a boyfriend! So I guess I’ll
just stumble across the hall and sleep with the first guy I find in there!"""
143,Phoebe," Yeah, we should get a move on if we wanna make those dinner
reservations. (Phoebe dumps a drawer full of makeup into a box.)"
146,Chandler, Still broken?
147,Joey," This sucks man! The last night you’re here and I lose the two most
important things in my life, the foosball table and $500."
148,Chandler," Well, there are other ways of winning back your money, how about a
little uh, a little Blackjack? (Holds up a deck of cards.)"
149,Joey," Nah, not my game."
150,Chandler," Okay, uh, how about, how about—y’know what? We could play a
new game. A new game, it’s fun."
151,Joey," Well, what’s it called?"
152,Chandler, Cups.
153,Joey, I don’t know how to play Cups.
154,Chandler," I’ll teach ya! Come on, come on, it’s really easy and
really, really fun."
155,Joey, All right.
156,Chandler," Okay, here you go. (He deals out two cards each.) I have two queens,
what do you have?"
157,Joey, A two and a five.
158,Chandler," Ho-ho, you win! 50 dollars!"
159,Joey, Really?!
160,Chandler," Oh yeah! Okay, let’s play again. (He deals out two cards each
again.) What do you got?"
161,Joey, A four and a nine.
162,Chandler, You’re kidding right?
163,Joey, No. Why?
164,Chandler, Well that’s a full cup! (Pays him again.)
165,Joey, Damn! I am good at Cups!
167,Monica, I’m not talking to her!
168,Phoebe," Well, one of you has to take the first step! And it should be you,
because she’s the one who’s leaving. It’s harder for her!"
169,Monica," Well, maybe you’re right—She made fun of my phone pen!"
170,Phoebe," I know, I took it hard too."
172,Monica," Listen Rachel, I feel really bad about—What are you doing? (She
sees that Rachel is unpacking.)"
173,Rachel, I’m unpacking!
174,Monica, What?!
175,Rachel," I’m not moving! (She re-hangs a picture, crookedly.) Is that
picture straight?"
176,Monica, It needs to go about 20 blocks to the left!
177,Rachel," Hey, y’know what? You’re the one who wants to make this big
change and move in with Chandler! You should be the one to go! Why should I have to
leave?!"
178,Monica, Because it’s my apartment!
179,Rachel, Well it’s mine too! What else you got?!
180,Monica," How about, you’re moving!! (Grabs a bunch of clothes and throws
them into a box. What follows is a brief sequence of Rachel unpacking and Monica packing
the same stuff over and over again as Rachel chants ""No."" and Monica chants
""Yes."")"
181,Rachel," Look! This is ridiculous. We should be packing you!! (She knocks over
Monica, grabs a box, and runs into the kitchen.)"
182,Phoebe," Hey, how are you guys doing?"
183,Rachel, Great! Monica’s moving!
184,Monica, (entering) I am not!
185,Rachel," Oh really?! Then how come all your stuff is in this box?! (Monica starts
chasing Rachel around the table.)"
186,Phoebe," Okay, you guys. You guys I think I know what’s going on here. Okay,
you guys… STOP!! (They stop.) I know that, I know that you’re
acting mad because you think that it’ll make it easier to leave. But deep down
you’re still really sad. Deep-deep down."
187,Monica, No Phoebe I am mad!
188,Phoebe," Well, deep-deep-deep down!"
189,Rachel," Yeah, I’m just mad!"
190,Phoebe, Then keep running. (They resume the chase.)
192,Chandler, You win.
193,Joey," Well, what did you have?"
194,Chandler," It doesn’t matter because nothing beats a three and a six. That
my friend is D-Cup. Okay, now much have you won so far?"
195,Joey," Uh, (counts the money) wow, 700."
196,Chandler, Not 700 exactly?
197,Joey, Yeah.
198,Chandler, Double it! (He does.)
199,Joey, What?
200,Chandler," Well you see in Cups, once you get $700, you have to double it."
201,Joey, Really?
202,Chandler," Hey, I didn’t make up the rules. Now, after you receive the
doubling bonus, you get uh, one card. Now that one card could be worth $100 bringing your
total to 1,500. (Joey gets excited.) Don’t get to excited because that’s not
gonna happen unless you get—No way! (He takes the top card, which is the two of
clubs. Of course, any card would’ve won. Chandler pays him.)"
204,Monica," Well, this is the last box of your clothes. I’m just gonna label
it, ""What were you thinking?"""
205,Rachel," Funny, because I was just gonna go across the hall and write that on
Chandler."
206,Phoebe," Hey you guys, I don’t mean to make things worse, but umm, I
don’t want to live with Rachel anymore."
208,Phoebe," You’re just so mean to each other! And I don’t want to end up
like that with Rachel. I still like you!"
209,Rachel," Well, Phoebe that’s fine because I’m not moving."
210,Monica," Whoa-whoa-whoa, Phoebe you gotta take her! Y’know I-I-I said some
really bad stuff about her, but y’know Rachel has some good qualities that
make her a good roommate."
211,Rachel, Oh really? Like what Monica?
212,Monica," Y’know she has 147,000 pairs of boots…"
213,Rachel," Oh yeah, good start Mon."
214,Monica, She lets you borrow them.
215,Rachel, Yeah and you stretch ‘em out with your big old clown feet.
216,Monica," Do you wanna live outside?! Because it’s gettin’ cold! (To
Phoebe) She gets tons of catalogs and umm, she’ll fold down the pages of the things
she thinks that I’d like."
217,Phoebe, What else?
218,Monica," When I take a shower, she leaves me little notes on the mirror."
219,Rachel," Yeah, I do. I-I do, do that."
220,Phoebe, That’s nice. I like having things to read in the bathroom.
221,Monica," When I fall asleep on the couch after reading, she covers me over with a
blanket."
222,Rachel," Well y’know, I don’t want you to be cold."
223,Monica," And when I told her that I was gonna be moving in with Chandler, she was
really supportive. (To Rachel) (Starts to cry) You were so great. You made it so easy. And
now you have to leave. And I have to live with a boy!! (They both break down in tears.)"
224,Rachel," Oh, it’s gonna be fine."
225,Phoebe," Okay Rachel, I can’t wait to live with you! And you know
what we should do? Bring Monica and then we could all live there together! We’ll have
so much fun!!"
226,Rachel," But honey, I think she’s moving in with Chandler."
227,Phoebe, Oh that’s right. You’re still set on that?
228,Monica," Kinda. (She hugs Phoebe and looks out the window. She moves closer to it
to get a better look.) Oh my God!"
230,Ross," (answering the phone) Hello? (Listens) Hey Mon, how’s the packing
going? (Listens) Ben? He’s fine. Yeah, he’s right—Oh my God! (He looks over
at the fake Ben and notices that the head has fallen off.) Get your head of your shirt
there son! (He tries to push the pumpkin through the neck hole.) What? (Listens) Yeah,
it’s a pumpkin. I’ll come pack."
232,Joey, Hey!
233,Chandler, What’s wrong?
234,Joey," Ross and I were helping the girls pack, took a little break, I lost $1,500
to him in Cups!"
235,Chandler, Wh-How did you lose at Cups?!
236,Joey," The same way you lost. I started out with a King and a Queen, bamn! Ross
gets a 2 and a 3. Then I get a Jack and a King, boom! Ross gets a 4 and a 5! Ross was
getting the Cup card, the D-Cup, the Sittin’ Down Bonus! Meanwhile, I didn’t
even get half a cup! Nothin’!!"
237,Chandler, Oh man!!
238,Joey," And he never played before either! Y’know what I think? I think
beginner’s luck, very important in Cups."
239,Chandler," All right, let’s play one more hand! One more!"
240,Joey," No, no, no more! I cannot lose another dime! I’m serious this time!
In-in fact, look, there’s a—I wanna give you something. And let me give it too
you know before I pawn it for Cups money. (He rolls the big white dog over) Now, I want
you to have the big white dog as a kinda of a, y’know, thank you for being such a
great roommate."
241,Chandler, I can’t take the big white dog! You love it!
242,Joey," It’s him, not it!"
243,Chandler," No, but wait—what if I bought it from you, y’know? And your
nice gesture would be giving it to me at a reasonable price, say (Gets choked up) $1,500?"
244,Joey," Wait a second, I see what you’re trying to do here! You-you’re
trying to give me money again!"
245,Chandler, When did I try to give you money?
246,Joey," Over there! (Points to the couch) Before, with the bills! You tried to
give some charity, I said ""No,"" you dropped it. Okay? Then we had a nice last
night together, we had some fun, we gambled, nobody tried to give anybody any money! Now
out of the blue, you start with the charity thing again!"
247,Chandler," I’m just trying to help you out! Okay? I wanna make sure that
you’re okay."
248,Joey," I will be okay! Look Chandler, you gotta get it out of your head
that I can’t take care of myself. Okay? Look, I’m not gonna miss you helping me
out with money. The only thing that I’m gonna miss…is you. And now the dog."
250,Monica, Hey. Call me when you get there. Okay?
251,Rachel, Okay.
252,Monica, I’m really gonna miss you.
254,Rachel, Oh! I have your key. Here you go. (Hands it to Monica.)
255,Monica, Thanks.
256,Rachel, Yeah.
258,Rachel," Oh God! This is silly, I’m gonna see you in a couple of hours!
(They hug again.) "
259,Monica, Yeah.
260,Rachel, Bye house!
262,Rachel, Bye Mon.
263,Monica, Bye.
265,Chandler, (entering) Hey.
266,Monica, She really left.
267,Chandler, I know. (He kisses her.)
268,Monica, Thank you.
269,Chandler, No problem roomie. (She turns around and hugs him.)
270,Monica, Can I ask you a question?
271,Chandler, Sure!
272,Monica," What the hell is that dog doing here?! (She notices the dog
sitting in the living room.)"
276,Chandler, I invented the game of Cups as a way to give Joey money.
277,Ross, And now you want that money back.
278,Chandler, Exactly.
279,Ross," Chandler, what kind of an idiot do you take me for? (As he picks up the
fake Ben.)"
280,Chandler, It’s not a real game! I made it up!
281,Ross," I’m sorry you lost your money, but I won it fair and square."
282,Chandler, At a fake game!!
283,Ross," Now, if you wanna try to make some of it back, I’d be glad to play
you for it. But I should warn you, I am very good at Cups."
284,Chandler, Okay! Now I assume the Saucer card came up when you played last.
285,Ross, No.
286,Chandler," Hmm, let’s see if it comes up this time. (He looks at his cards
and shrugs.)"
0,Phoebe, Ready?
1,Rachel, Yeah.
2,Phoebe, Okay.
3,Rachel, Hi...
4,Phoebe, it's...
5,Rachel, Rachel...
6,Phoebe, and…
7,Rachel, Phoebe’s...
8,Phoebe, please...
9,Rachel, leave...
10,Phoebe, leave…
11,Rachel," Wait, I-I just said ""leave."" "
12,Phoebe," Yeah, I know because you have all the good words. What do I get? I get
""it’s,"" ""and"" oh I'm sorry, I have ""A."" Forget it."
13,Rachel," Phoebe, come on that's silly."
14,Phoebe," All right, so let's switch."
15,Rachel," No, I have all of the good words. OK, fine, fine, we can switch."
16,Phoebe, Okay.
17,Rachel, Okay.
18,Phoebe, Hi…
19,Rachel, Everybody…
20,Phoebe, It's…
21,Rachel, Rachel…
22,Phoebe, and…
23,Rachel, Phoebe’s…
24,Phoebe," Please...wait, how did you do that?"
25,Rachel, What?
26,Phoebe," Oh, you're no ordinary roommate are you?"
27,Rachel," Phoebe, come on can we finish this later? Cause I wanna go running
before it gets dark. Oh! Why don't you come with me?!"
28,Phoebe, Really?
29,Rachel," Yeah, it'll be fun. We'll run in the park. It'll be like our first
y’know roommate bonding thing."
30,Phoebe," Okay, let's go running!"
31,Rachel, Yeah and there's really cute guys there.
32,Phoebe, Let's run towards them!
33,Rachel, OK!
34,Phoebe," All right, wait just one more second. Hi, it's Phoebe and Rachel's.
Please leave a message, thanks! "
35,Rachel, Now wait a minute. You just took all the words!
36,Phoebe, Uh-huh. You've met your match Rachel Green.
39,Ross," So, I just finished this fascinating book. By the year 2030, there'll be
computers that can carry out the same amount of functions as an actual human brain. So
theoretically you could download your thoughts and memories into this computer and-and-and
live forever as a machine."
40,Chandler, (not amused) And I just realized I can sleep with my eyes open.
42,Monica, Hey!
44,Monica," (jumps over a box) Honey, that's a great idea nailing the boxes to the
floor!"
45,Chandler, I didn't nail the boxes to the floor.
46,Monica," Oh, So you can move them!"
47,Chandler," Yes, and while I'm doing that, Ross has a great computer story for
you. "
49,Joey," Hey everybody! Uh, I'd like you to meet Janine. She's-she's gonna be my
new roommate!"
51,Ross, Hi! (Rushes over to shake her hand instantly.)
53,Joey," Yeah, she's gonna live with me!"
54,Monica, It's nice to meet you. Janine...?
56,Joey," I didn't know that! Well, what a pretty last name!"
57,Chandler," So, uh, wh-where ya from?"
59,Joey, (shocked) From the land down under? I didn't know that either!
60,Ross," So uh, wha-uh, what do you do?"
62,Joey, You're a dancer? She-she's a dancer!
64,Joey," Oh, hey let me. (Opens the door for Janine and after he closes the door
behind her gasps ecstatically.)"
65,Monica," Joey, did you even interview this woman before you asked her to move in?"
66,Joey, Of course I did.
67,Monica," Uh-huh, what exactly did you ask her?"
68,Joey," ""When can you move in?"""
69,Ross, Thank you for bringing her into our lives.
70,Chandler, Unbelievable
71,Monica," Oh, so you like her too Chandler?"
72,Chandler," Hey, look at all the boxes!"
73,Joey," Ugh, I cannot wait to ask her out!"
74,Monica," Wait a minute...Joey. Joey you can't ask her out, she's your roommate.
It-it'll be way too complicated. "
75,Ross," Yeah, yeah man don't do it. I mean if you date her, then-then-then I can't
date her."
76,Chandler," All right, think about it. Now remember when you were going out with
that girl Donna and you guys broke up. Remember how horrible it was when you guys bumped
into each other at the supermarket?"
77,Joey," Oh God, yeah."
78,Chandler, Now imagine you live at the supermarket.
79,Joey, (happily) Okay!
80,Chandler, No-no
81,Joey," Oh, Oh, you're right! I don't want that. I can't date her!"
82,Monica," Yeah and you better watch the flirting too, cause you know, in such
close quarters, it could be trouble."
83,Joey," Well, that's gonna be tough Mon. I mean it's hard for me to be around an
attractive woman and not flirt."
84,Monica," (chuckles) Hmm, well you're around me all the time and you don't flirt."
85,Joey, You a little sad about that sweetheart?
87,Phoebe," I have to tie my shoe, so you go ahead, I'll catch up."
88,Rachel, Okay. (Runs off.)
89,Phoebe," Okay. (Starts running crazily with her arms flapping and her legs far
apart) Come on! That's not running! Let's go! (Rachel pauses, then follows, embarrassed.)"
91,Rachel," You guys, I'm telling you, when she runs, she looks like a cross between
Kermit The Frog and The Six Million Dollar Man."
92,Ross," Monica had such a crush on him. Yeah, she used to kiss his poster every
night before she went to bed."
93,Rachel, Oh! I used to do that too!
94,Monica," Did you also have his album, It's Not Easy Being Green?"
95,Rachel," Aw, Mon...(Kisses her on the cheek)"
96,Monica," So, Phoebe runs weird huh?"
97,Rachel," Yeah, yeah and you know what, I know she's gonna wanna run again, I just
don't know how to get out of it, I mean, I live with her."
98,Monica, Why don't you just be straight with her? Tell her the truth.
99,Ross, Yeah.
100,Rachel," You're right, you're right. I should just tell her the truth."
102,Phoebe, Hey!
103,Ross, Hey!
104,Rachel," Pheebs, Monica tripped me, I don't think I can ever run again, ever!"
105,Phoebe, Why? Why would you do that?
106,Monica, I don't know. Rachel I'm-I'm sorry that I hurt your ankles.
107,Rachel, Ankle.
108,Monica, We'll see.
110,Chandler," OK, I'm officially unpacked. Thanks for helping me man. (Turns around
and sees that Joey isn't there.) Joe? (Hears giggling coming from a box) Well, I guess
Joey went home. Oh and look, there's still one box that I have to unpack. (Hears the
giggling again)"
111,Joey, (jumps out of the box) I Gotcha!!
112,Chandler, (pretending) Oh my God! You-almost-gave-me-a-heart-attack.
113,Joey," Boy, it was so hard not to laugh, I tell ya. Hey, hey, the place looks
great!"
114,Chandler," Yeah, not bad right? You know what, Monica’s gonna be working
late, so I'm gonna make this place spotless. You know what else I'm gonna do, know what
else I'm gonna do? I'm gonna go downstairs, I'm gonna get her some flowers. Now who
wouldn't wanna live with me?"
115,Joey," (raises his hand) I don't! No, I wanna live with the super-hot Australian
dancer."
116,Chandler," Yeah, now how's that going though? Are you okay with the not-flirting
thing?"
117,Joey," Yeah. Well, so far yeah. But it's tough you know? I got all this built up
flirting energy and I don't know how to get rid of it. (Gives Chandler the
""Joey-love,"" look.) How you doin?"
119,Joey, (voice cracking) Ohhhh man
121,Joey," No-no-no-no-no, it's-it's uh, you just uh, uh reminded me that uh, I need
to do my stretches too. (Starts to stretch, groans painfully)"
123,Joey, (jumps up and yells) 
125,Joey," Uh-uh nothing. I-I-I-I didn't want you to touch me cause I'm -I'm all
sweaty from the workout. I better hit the shower. (Goes into the bathroom and comes back
out quickly) Oh my God!"
129,Phoebe," (jumps in front of Rachel) Hi! Oh yeah, uh-huh, it's me. I saw you grab
your running shoes this morning and sneak out. You lied so you could run by yourself."
130,Rachel," No, no Phoebe no, I was...no. You know what, I was, I was actually just
checking to, see, if I could run. And I can!"
131,Phoebe," Please Rachel, I am not an idiot. (Runs off)"
132,Rachel," No, wait Phoebe."
134,Ross," (enters) Wow, couples who live together do start to look alike. So,
Mondler...uh, what uh, what ‘cha doin?"
135,Chandler, What does it look like I'm doing? I am cleaning!
136,Ross, Did you get Monica's authorization to move all of her stuff?
137,Chandler, Authorization? I don't need that. I'm gonna put everything back.
138,Ross, Put it back exactly where you found it?
139,Chandler," Yes I'm gonna put it back (Mocking Ross) exactly where I found
it."
140,Ross," ‘Kay, first of all, this attitude is not helping."
141,Chandler, She's not gonna care if I put her stuff back in the same stupid place.
142,Ross," Whoa, hello, did you just meet Monica?"
143,Chandler," She is gonna recognize that I did a nice thing and-and, appreciate it."
144,Ross," Hmm -you know, actually this'll work out well. Cause when you have to move
back in with Joey, Joey's hot new roommate can come and live with me."
145,Chandler," I see, I see, y-y-you're trying to freak me out."
146,Ross," Look Chandler, Monica is really weird about this kind stuff all right.
Believe me, I lived with her for 16 years. She is going to freak…out. Oh my God,
she's going to sit on you."
147,Chandler," No, she's not okay? And I'll prove it to you. I'm gonna call her right
now. (Picks up the phone and wipes it off) Phone's done ehh."
148,Monica, (on phone) Hi!
149,Chandler," Hey Mon, how's it going?"
150,Monica," Terrible. If-if I want something done right, I have to do it myself.
Other people just wreck stuff. I really think I might kill someone tonight. "
151,Chandler," Oh come on, come on, it can't be that bad."
152,Monica," It's worse. The only thing that's getting me through is knowing that I'm
gonna be seeing you soon. I think I may even try to get out of here early."
153,Chandler, No! No-no-no-no-no-no. It sounds like they really need you down there.
154,Monica,"  Well, are you just hanging out with Ross?"
155,Chandler," It's, all good! Okay bye-bye Mon! (To Ross) She's-she's gonna kill me."
156,Ross," Yeah, the phone was facing the other way. (Chandler fixes it and a picture
frame off the table.) And that goes back up there."
159,Chandler," We should start with the big stuff. Y’know? That'll be the
easiest. Uh, let's start with the couch. (He picks up one end and Ross doesn't help) I got
it. (He moves it back to where he thinks it goes.)"
160,Ross," Yeah that-that, doesn't look right."
161,Chandler," What are you talking about? The couch is perfectly in line with the
carpet. And then I can just walk over here and casually just put my feet right up on
the...(Tries to rest his feet on the coffee table but they won't reach) OK, OK, here's
what we do, we just uh, move the couch closer to the coffee table."
162,Ross," Whoa, whoa, but then the back of the couch won't line up with he back of
the carpet."
163,Chandler," OK well here, we'll just move the coffee table closer to the couch."
164,Ross," Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, but then the coffee table won't be centered in the
seating area."
165,Chandler," Yes, but the coffee table doesn't match
the...blahebdmsdlkhdyslkd;btyds...Rooosss!!!!"
166,Joey," (entering) Look, what am I gonna do? I'm not flirting but still, I'm
drawing her to me like - like a moth to a flame! (Tries to put his feet on the coffee
table...they won't reach and looks around.) What the hell's going on over here?!?!?
(Points to Chandler) Monica's gonna kill you! Look I need your help, I have to do
something to-to repel this woman! Wait a minute, wait a minute, you guys repel women all
the time. "
167,Ross," Hey, I've been married 3 times"
169,Joey," No-no-no I've seen it happen, you-you get a rapport going with a woman but
somehow you manage to kill it. What's your secret?"
170,Ross," Look, we do not repel women OK? That is completely untrue."
171,Chandler," Oh no, yes we do my man. Remember when we were back in college and we
went to that spring dance and you walked right up to that girl you liked and you could not
stop talking about the Irish potato famine?"
172,Ross," Yeah, well what about you? You weren't you know, so hot in college either.
After everything he said, he'd go ""ba dum bum chessh"" "
173,Chandler," Yeah, Monica doesn't like that either, Maybe I should stop doing that.
"
174,Ross," Oh y'know what, girls don't like it when I start talking about science."
175,Chandler, That's not specific to girls.
176,Joey," This is great, this is great, what else, what else?"
177,Ross," Uh, they don't like it when you correct their grammar."
178,Chandler, And they don't like it when you explain why your jokes are funny.
179,Ross, They don't like it when you keep asking them if they like you.
180,Chandler," Man, I'm so lucky I have Monica."
181,Ross, (nonchalantly) I'm never gonna find love again.
183,Rachel," Hey Phoebe, can I talk to you for a second?"
184,Phoebe, Sure 
185,Rachel," Okay, um, I...(Phoebe walks into her room.) All right Phoebe look, I
just wanted to say that I'm sorry. OK? I handled the situation horribly and I should not
have lied to you. "
186,Phoebe," So, what should you have done?"
187,Rachel," Well, I-I should've told you the truth."
188,Phoebe," Uh-Huh, Which is...?"
189,Rachel," Well, y'know, the reason I didn't wanna go running with you is because
um, well y'know the way that you run is a little...(Starts flapping her arms)"
190,Phoebe, So?
191,Rachel," Well, it's embarrassing. People were looking at us like we were crazy."
192,Phoebe, Why do you care?
193,Rachel, Because they're people.
194,Phoebe, But people that you don't know and will never see again.
195,Rachel," Yes, but still. They're people…with eyes."
196,Phoebe," Well, I didn't get embarrassed running next to Miss (panting). But no,
okay. No, no, I can see why running with me would be embarrassing to you. Yeah, okay.
You're uptight."
197,Rachel," I-I am not uptight—Hey-hey-hey-oh-oh! Listen, I am not uptight,
man."
198,Phoebe," That's okay Rachel. I'm not judging you; that's just who you are. Me.
I'm more free y'know? I run like I did when I was a kid, cause that's the only way it's
fun. Y'know, I mean didn’t you ever run so fast you thought your legs were gonna fall
off? Y'know, like when you were like running towards the swings or running away from
Satan? (Rachel looks confused) The neighbor's dog."
200,Chandler," Okay, is this lamp in the same place?"
201,Ross, Who cares? I repel women.
203,Chandler," (blocks the door) No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no!!! You can't come in here!
R-r-r-r-Ross is naked."
204,Monica, What?!
205,Ross, (whispers) What?!
206,Chandler," (to Ross) I couldn't say that I was naked because she's allowed too
see me naked."
207,Ross, Why does anyone have to be naked?
208,Monica, Why is Ross naked?
209,Ross, I-I had to show Chandler something?
210,Monica, Naked?
211,Ross," Yeah-yeah I uh, I have a uh, a guy problem."
212,Monica, Is it the same thing that Chandler had?
213,Chandler," Look, uh, just come later, we'll get everything squared away and you
can come back later."
214,Monica," Okay, listen, there's still some of Chandler's medicine under the sink
in the bathroom. Bye!"
215,Chandler, Bye! Thank God
216,Ross," Dude, what'd you have?"
217,Chandler," Look, we have no time okay? We must focus. We gotta get everything
back into its original place."
218,Ross," (realizes something) The photo album! There were millions of pictures of
the apartment in the photo album. We just go through it and match everything to the
pictures."
219,Chandler," That's perfect! That's brilliant! (Starts going through the photo
album)"
220,Ross," So really, what'd ya have?"
223,Joey," Uh, don't you mean ""for whom?"""
225,Joey," Pizza, heh, its not like I never had that before...ba dum bum cheshhh."
227,Joey," All right, All right, let's just get this out in the open okay? You're
hot. I'm lovable. Clearly there's a vibe going on between us. But, we're roommates and
it's a huge mistake for us to continue down this road."
229,Joey," No, no, no, I'm telling ya. Imagine yourself living in a supermarket and
you will understand okay? So the question is, what do we do?"
231,Joey, Oh!
233,Joey," Oh! I see what happened. It's because I was trying to repel you. Right?
Believe me, you'd feel a lot different if I turned it on."
235,Joey," Oh, I do. (Gives her the Joey-love look.) How you doin?"
237,Joey, What?!?!
239,Joey, Oh dear God!
241,Rachel, (Runs into Phoebe.) Hey!
242,Phoebe, Hey!
243,Rachel," Oh honey, I'm so sorry, you were right, this feels great!"
244,Phoebe," See? And you don't care if people are staring, it's just for a second
cause then you're gone!"
245,Rachel," Gone! I mean its amazing Pheebs. I feel so free and so graceful. (Turns
and bumps into a mounted policeman and falls) Hey! Look out for the horse! Sorry! (Runs
off.)"
247,Monica, Is it okay for me to come in now?
248,Chandler, Uh-huh
249,Monica, Why is everything different?
250,Ross, Bye! (Runs out)
251,Chandler," No, I don't see anything different other than the fact that the room
got so much brighter when you came into it. (Forced laughter)"
252,Monica," Well, the end table is wrong, The couch looks bizarre and don't even get
me started on the refrigerator magnets."
253,Chandler," Okay look, don't...don't be mad okay? But after I unpacked the boxes I
wanted to do something nice for you, so, I-I-I cleaned the apartment. So I moved
everything around and then I forgot where it, where it went back and I'm sorry, I'm very
sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry."
254,Monica," It's okay. Chandler, are you afraid of me or something? "
255,Chandler, Do you want me to be afraid of you?
256,Monica," Of course not. I mean gosh, Chandler what you did, it's, it's a
wonderful thing and I really appreciate it. I know I have this weird thing where I want
everything to be in the perfect place, but I'd never expect you to worry about that."
257,Chandler, Really?
258,Monica, Of course!
259,Chandler, Oh well you're the best. You come here to me.
260,Monica," All right, hold on okay? First thing's first. (Gets her cleaning gloves
on) Okay, now did Ross sit anywhere while he was naked?"
263,Ross," So it said that by the year 2030, there'll be computers that can carry out
the same number of functions as an actual human brain. So theoretically we could download
our thoughts and our memories into this computer..."
265,Ross," That's so Janine, you-you-you know what, do you know we're doing right
now? You and I, we're interfacing."
267,Chandler, Ba dum bumb cheshhh!

guess who’s coming to Thanksgiving dinner?"
1,Chandler, Sydney Portier? Hehheh.
3,Monica," (not amused by Chandler’s joke) I miss Rachel. (To Chandler) No, my
parents."
4,Chandler," Oh! That’s great, they haven’t seen the place since I moved
in!"
6,Monica," Yeah, and y’know, if you could not mention to them that we live
together, that would be great! (Quickly trying to change subjects), I was thinking we
would eat around four."
8,Chandler," (shocked at the news) Why can’t I tell them that we live
together?"
9,Monica," Because they don’t know we’re dating. (Again, trying to
quickly change subjects.) Do you think we should eat in the kitchen? (Goes to the sink and
the stove to cook.)"
10,Chandler, Why haven’t you told them?!
11,Monica," Um, well, I was going to, I-I-I really was. But um, then somewhere, just
out of nowhere, I didn’t."
12,Chandler, Why haven’t you told them?! Wouldn’t they be happy?!
13,Monica," (trying to change subjects, excitedly) So! Dinner in the kitchen around
four! I’ll see you then. (Pats Chandler on the shoulder and goes into the living
room.)"
14,Chandler, Why wouldn’t they be happy?
15,Monica," Well, um, because mainly, um, they don’t like you. I’m sorry."
16,Chandler, What? What? Why?!
17,Monica," Maybe because you used to be aloof, or that you’re really
sarcastic, or that, y’know, you joke around all the time. Or that you take off your
clothes and throw them on the couch."
18,Chandler, Is this why they don’t like me or why you don’t like me?
19,Monica," Look, I know that I should’ve told them. I know I shouldn’t
care what they think. I’m sorry. "
20,Chandler," Y’know, it’ll be okay. It’ll be okay. Because when they
come over, I will be all charming, I will make them fall in love with me, and then
we’ll tell ‘em."
21,Monica, You really think that’ll work?
22,Chandler," Hey, I can be pretty charming, babe, I won YOU over, didn’t I?"
23,Monica," (hugging Chandler) I don’t think you’ll ever get my parents
that drunk! "
26,Chandler," Hey! (Sees Ross is there) Oh, good, Ross! You’re parents like me,
right?"
28,Ross," (only half-paying attention) Yes, of course they like you!"
29,Chandler, Well Monica just told me that they don’t.
30,Ross," (not paying attention) Yeah, they don’t like you."
31,Chandler, (annoyed) Do you know why?
32,Ross," I dunno, maybe it’s because you’re really sarcastic. Or maybe
it’s cause you uh-"
33,Chandler, (angry) Well if people don’t know they shouldn’t just guess!
35,Chandler," This is great, another Thanksgiving with nothing to give thanks for."
36,Joey," Maybe I could give thanks for you shuttin’ up, eh?"
37,Chandler," Maybe I could give thanks by taking my Playstation over to my
new apartment."
38,Joey, Well maybe I love ya’.
39,Chandler, [mocks that last comment].
42,Chandler, Hey.
46,Ross," (trying to act manly in front of Janine) No I don’t want to
play video games, Joey!"
48,Joey," Yeah! Yeah, why? What’s up?"
50,Ross, For real?
52,Joey," Ye-ye, we go to yours!"
53,Ross," Yeah, see, we-we-we have to stop across the hall, because it’s my
sister. But, uh, uh y’know actually, growing up with a sister was nice because it
really helped me understand women. Yeah, you-you should tell your friends that."
57,Joey," How you got three women to marry you, I’ll never know."
59,Phoebe, Hey!
61,Rachel," Hey! Hey, Pheebs, check it out. Yeah, for my desert, I have chosen to
make a traditional English truffle!"
62,Phoebe," Wow, that sounds great! And what are you making Monica, in case
Rachel’s dessert is...[about to say “bad”] so good that I eat all of it.
There’s none left for anybody else!"
64,Monica, Nothing.
65,Rachel, (worried) Nothing?
66,Monica," No, sweetie, I-I trust you."
67,Rachel," So, if-if I mess this up, there’s nothing else for dessert?"
68,Monica, You’re not gonna mess it up.
69,Rachel," Wow, Monica, I love that, you really have faith in me. Thank you.
Technical question, how do you know when uh, the butter’s done?"
70,Monica," Well, it’s done about two minutes before it looks like that."
74,Joey," Oh, ooh the food smells great, Mon!"
75,Ross, And the place looks so nice!
76,Joey," Yeah, hey hey, Happy Thanksgiving everybody!"
77,Ross, Happy Thanksgiving!
79,Joey," Well, this has been great!"
80,Ross, See ya!
82,Monica, Whoa whoa whoa! Where’re you goin’?
83,Ross," Oh, oh, we did say we’d stop by this little thing Joey’s
roommate is having."
84,Monica," Oh, Janine, the really hot dancer girl?"
85,Ross," Some would say she’s attractive, yes."
86,Phoebe, And who else is going to be there?
87,Joey," Uh, some of her friends, yeah."
88,Rachel, Her dancer friends?
89,Joey," (frustrated) Yes, all right? All of her hot dancer friends are gonna be
there and they’re gonna be, be drinkin’ and dancin, and we really wanna go!"
90,Ross," (to Joey) Dude, we were good!"
91,Monica," You’re not gonna go anywhere, you said you were gonna eat here, and
you’re gonna eat here!"
92,Phoebe," Yeah, and-and leaving us to go see hot dancer girls is not very
Thanksgivingy."
93,Ross," Oh, but-but it is, uh, it’s just like the first Thanksgiving, when
the Indians and the Pilgrims uh, sat down to dinner."
94,Joey," Yeah, yeah, and the Indians taught the Pilgrims what it meant to be hot in
the new world!"
100,Monica," Dad [kisses Jack], Mom [kisses Judy]. Look! Look who it is it’s
Chandler!"
102,Chandler," Mr. and Mrs. Geller, you look wonderful, it is great to have you hear,
let us take off your coats!"
104,Chandler," Whoa, snowing out there?"
111,Monica," Dad, Chandler was just laughing at your joke."
114,Phoebe," Rach, Rach, I just remembered. I had a dream about Mr. Geller last
night."
115,Rachel, Really?!
116,Phoebe," Yeah, I dreamt that he saved me from a burning building and he was so
brave and so strong! And it’s making me look at him totally differently. Y’know,
I mean he used to be just, y’know “Jack Geller Monica and Ross’s dad”
and now he’s he’s “Jack Geller, dream hunk."""
118,Rachel," I dunno. Y’know to me he’ll always be “Jack Geller, walks
in while you’re changing.”"
120,Monica," Y’know dad, Chandler is one of Ross’s very best friends!"
121,Chandler," Yeah, Ross sure is a great guy, y’know I’ve always felt that
how a young man turns out is a reflection on his father."
124,Chandler, (worried) He’s the headliner of a gay burlesque show.
126,Joey," Rach, you’re killin’ us here, will ya serve the dessert already?
Those drunken dancers are waiting! "
127,Rachel," (looking at her truffle) Look at it, isn’t it beautiful?"
128,Ross," Yeah, yeah, what is it?"
129,Rachel," It’s a truffle. It’s got all of these layers. First
there’s a layer of ladyfingers, then a layer of jam, then custard, which I made from
scratch, [Joey and Ross make impressed faces] then raspberries, more ladyfingers, then
beef sauteed with peas and onions, [Joey and Ross look like something’s wrong.] then
a little more custard, and then bananas, and then I just put some whipped cream on top!"
131,Ross, W-What was the one right before bananas?
132,Rachel," The beef? Yeah, that was weird to me, too. But then, y’know, I
thought “well, there’s mincemeat pie,” I mean that’s an English
dessert, these people just put very strange things in their food, y’know. [To Joey]
Oh! by the way, can I borrow some Rum from your place?"
133,Joey, Y-sure!
134,Rachel," (teasingly) And while I’m gone don’t you boys sneak
a taste."
137,Ross," Beef in a dessert?! I- no no no, there is no way!"
139,Joey," I know, and only one layer of jam?! What is up with that?"
141,Ross," Oh my God, the pages are stuck together!"
142,Joey, (turning to Chandler in a scolding tone) Chandler!
143,Ross," Oh My God, she-she made half a English Trifle, and half a...Sheperd’s
Pie!"
144,Joey," (sad) Oh man! Now she’s gonna start all over! We’re never gonna
get to introduce the hot girls to the new world!"
145,Ross," No, no, we will. We just won’t tell her she messed up."
146,Joey, Just let her serve the beef-custard thing?
147,Ross," Yeah, it’ll be like a funny Thanksgiving story!"
148,Joey," (shrugging his shoulders to go along with it) Vomiting stories are
funny..."
150,Rachel," Joey, God, your apartment is like a hundred degrees!"
151,Joey, Did-did it make you wanna walk around in your underwear?
152,Rachel, No!
153,Joey, (frustrated) Still not hot enough!
156,Phoebe, Rachel?
157,Rachel, Yeah?
158,Phoebe," Okay, look at him. Look at those strong hands. Oh what I wouldn’t
give to be that can of (looks closer to see what Jack is drinking) condensed milk."
161,Monica," Mom, uh, Chandler was just saying how beautiful your sweater is."
163,Chandler," Oh, yes. Well it’s very beautiful. It’s cream-colored and
tight [Realizes what he just said and looks worried. Monica and Ross also looked shocked.
Judy and Jack give Chandler a very dirty look.] I don’t mean tight, I mean it’s
not too tight, not that I was looking at-[giving up all hope, he puts his head into his
hands.]"
166,Chandler, (shocked) What?
167,Monica, (shocked) What?
168,Ross," (worried) Dude, I need to talk to you a sec."
171,Ross," Okay, I think I might know why my parents don’t like you."
172,Chandler, You do? Why?
173,Ross," Okay, remember, we were young. Hey, Spring break, sophomore year, I got
high in my bedroom and my parents walked in and smelled it and so I told them that you had
gotten stoned and jumped out the window."
174,Chandler, What?! Why did you do that?
175,Ross," I don’t know, aheh, your’s was the first name that-that popped
into my head, I’m I’m sorry. I-I didn’t think it would matter."
176,Chandler, How could it not matter?!
177,Ross," How was I supposed to know we’d end up being friends after college,
let alone you-you would be living with my sister?"
178,Chandler, What about all that “friends forever” stuff?
179,Ross," I don’t know, I-I was all high. "
182,Monica," Mom and dad just sent me in here to find out if you (points to Chandler)
were trying to get Ross stoned!"
183,Chandler," Your parents caught Ross smoking pot in college and he blamed it on
me!"
184,Monica," Ross, I can’t believe you’d do that!"
185,Chandler," The reason we haven’t told them we’re together is because
they hate me, okay? So will you fix this?"
186,Ross," Okay, okay, I’ll tell ‘em it wasn’t Chandler who got high.
Now who should I say it was?"
187,Monica," You! It’s not like it’s a big deal! You-you don’t still
do it or anything!"
188,Ross," Alright, alright, now-now who should I say tricked me into doing it?"
190,Monica," Dad, please don’t pick your teeth out here! Alright, and if
you’re gonna put your feet up, why don’t you sit on the-"
191,Phoebe," Monica, leave him alone!"
193,Joey," (to Rachel) Will you hurry up? Did you not hear me before when I told you
that all of Janine’s friends are dancers?! And that they’re going to be drinking
alot!?"
194,Rachel," (sarcastically) No, I did, but tell me again, because it’s so
romantic."
195,Joey, Well you’re whippin’ so slow! Can’t you do it any faster?
196,Rachel," Joey! Come on! I don’t wanna make any mistakes, alright? This is
the only dessert and if I screw it up everybody's gonna be like “Oh, remember that
Thanksgiving when Rachel screwed up the trifle?”"
198,Rachel," So why don’t you just let me worry about making the trifle and you
just worry about eating it, alright?"
199,Joey, Oh I am!
201,Monica," Ross, if you don’t tell them, then I will!"
202,Ross," Okay, fine!"
205,Joey, Ross! Can I talk to you for a second?
206,Ross," Oh, uh, can it wait a second Joey? I have to tell my parents something. No
it can’t? Okay."
209,Joey," Okay, look, I think we have to tell Rachel she messed up her dessert."
210,Ross," What?! What is with everybody? It’s Thanksgiving, not...Truth-Day!"
211,Joey," Look, when everyone eats that...that...Banana-Meat thing, they’re all
gonna’ make fun of her, do you want that?"
212,Ross," Okay, okay, we’ll just get everyone to act like they like it.
That-that way noone makes fun of her and we still get to go to Sweet Potatoe Pie!
(Referring to the dancers.)"
213,Joey," (scolding) Dude, they’re not objects."
215,Joey," Just kiddin,’ I’ll talk to them, you distract Rach."
217,Ross," Hey Rach, can I talk to you outside for a second?"
218,Rachel, Okay...
220,Rachel," What’s up, Ross?"
221,Ross," So um...Thanksgiving. The holiday season is upon us, hm? "
222,Rachel, Yeah!
223,Ross, And um...You look nice today.
224,Rachel," Oh no. No Ross, don’t do this."
225,Ross, What?
226,Rachel, I just- I don’t think us getting back together is a good idea.
227,Ross, (shocked) Eh?
228,Rachel," I thought this might happen today. Ross, I know the holidays can be
rough. Y’know? And it’s probably really hard for you to be alone right now."
229,Ross, (cutting her off) You’re alone.
230,Rachel," No, I-I live with Phoebe. I mean you’re [pity-tone] alone,
alone. And I just-it’s just not the time for us. I’m sorry."
231,Ross," (just trying to get out of the conversation) Ah well, can’t blame a
guy for trying!"
233,Joey," Oh and (Ross begins to open the door and Joey says some gibberish word to
indicate to Ross that he’s not done yet. Ross closes the door again.) Okay, and uh if
anyone needs help pretending to like it, I learned something in acting class, try uh,
rubbing your stomach (Rubs his stomach) or uh, or saying “mmm” and uh, oh oh!
And smiling (Smiles while pretending to stir a bowl), okay?"
234,Chandler," Yeah, I’m not gonna pay for those acting classes anymore."
236,Joey," Rachel, there you are! Come on, let’s serve that dessert already!"
237,Rachel," Joey, you’re gonna have to stop rushing me, you know what? You
don’t get any dessert."
238,Joey, (happily) Really?
239,Rachel," No, I’m just kidding I would never do that to you! Okay, everybody,
it’s trifle time!"
240,Phoebe," So, now, Rach, this is a traditional English trifle, isn’t it?"
241,Rachel, It sure is.
242,Phoebe, Wow. So then did you make it with beef or Eggplant?
243,Rachel, Beef.
244,Phoebe," I can’t have any. You know I don’t eat meat. (Faking
dissapointment.) Ohhh no."
246,Rachel," Alright, Monica, I want you to have the first taste."
247,Monica, Really?
249,Rachel," Oh oh oh, wait! You only got whipped cream in there! Ya gotta take a
bite with all the layers!"
250,Monica, Okay.
252,Rachel," Op! Wait, you dropped a pea."
254,Rachel, Well?
255,Monica," (faking joy. Rubbing her stomach and smiling at the same time, like Joey
said) Mmmm! It’s good!"
256,Rachel, Really? How good? 
257,Monica," It’s so good, that I feel really selfish about being the only one
who’s eating it, that I think we should have everyone taste how good it is.
Especially Ross."
261,Chandler," (clearly lying and hating the dessert) Yeah, this is so good, that
I’m gonna go enjoy it on the balcony so that I can enjoy the view whilst I enjoy my
dessert."
266,Monica," (again, lying) I’m gonna go into the bathroom so I can look at it
in the mirror, as I eat it."
268,Rachel," Okay, now what was that all about? Is it-does it not taste good? Let me
try it."
270,Ross," Wha? No no! Ah! (Ross scarfs all of his trifle down in about a second. He
looks like he’s going to throw up.) (Lying) All gone! So good! Maybe Chandler has
some left."
272,Ross, It tastes like feet!
273,Joey, I like it.
274,Ross, Are you kidding?
275,Joey, What’s not to like? Custard? Good. Jam? Good. Meat? Gooooood.
277,Rachel," ...So a bird just grabbed it, and then tried to fly away with it and,
and then just dropped it on the street?"
279,Chandler," (lying) Yes, but if it’s any consolation, before the bird dropped
it, he seemed to enjoy it."
281,Phoebe," Rachel, come here. (Rachel walks over to Phoebe. Chandler sits down on
the lounge-chair.) Okay, I was just starting to take my Thanksgiving nap, and I had
another dream about Jack."
282,Rachel," Oh, Phoebe, do I wanna hear this?"
283,Phoebe," I dunno, let’s see! So, okay, I dreamt that we were gonna get
married, and he left, becuz he had to go fight a fire. And, um, so okay, I went to a night
club, and I saw him making out with a girl."
284,Rachel," (humoring Phoebe) Oh my God, he dream-cheated on you!"
285,Phoebe," Yeah, but then Jacques Cousteau came and he kicked his ass for betraying
me! It was soo cool! Then, he took me diving and he introduced me to his pet seahorse,
who, by the way, was totally coming on to me, and please, that is not gonna happen."
288,Phoebe," Five minutes ago, a line like that would’ve floored me. Now
nothing. Well, not nothing, I am still a woman."
290,Monica, Ross? Let’s go.
291,Ross," Oh yeah, about telling Mom and Dad, I was thinking about maybe writing a
letter."
292,Monica," Alright, you know what? That’s it. You’ve had your chance."
293,Ross, Wha-what?
294,Monica," (out loud, to her parents) Mom! Dad! Ross smoked pot in college!"
296,Ross," (in a 5 year old’s tone) (To Monica) You are such a tattletale! Mom,
Dad, you remember that-that time you walked in my room and smelled marijuana?"
298,Ross," Well I told you it was Chandler who was smoking the pot but it was me.
I’m sorry."
300,Monica," And Dad, y’know that mailman that you got fired? He didn’t
steal your Playboys! Ross did!"
302,Ross," Yeah, well, Hurricane Gloria didn’t break the porch swing, Monica
did!"
305,Monica, Ross hasn’t worked at the museum for a year!
307,Ross, Monica and Chandler are living together!
310,Monica, Ross married Rachel in Vegas! And got divorced! Again!!!!
312,Phoebe, (joining in) I love Jacques Cousteau!
313,Rachel," (reading the recipe magazine, finally figuring out that...) I
wasn’t supposed to put beef in the trifle!"
314,Joey, (pounding the table) I wanna gooooooo!
319,Ross," I-I uh, I got tricked into all those things!"
322,Chandler, Thank you!
324,Chandler, (In a parent-like tone) I’ll talk to them! 
327,Rachel," You guys! It was bananas, cream, and beef! I-I just cannot believe that
you ate that so that I wouldn’t feel bad!"
328,Monica," Well actually, I-I didn’t eat mine. It’s still in the
bathroom."
329,Joey," No it isn’t, I ate that."
331,Joey," Nope, got it and I got yours (Pointing to Jack) too. "
0,Chandler," Let me ask you, why is everybody using these tiny lights nowadays? I
remember when people used to use big lights."
1,Rachel," That’s a good story, Grandpa."
3,Ross, Hey
5,Ross," Wow, Monica’s letting other people help decorate her tree! Did
someone get her drunk again or?"
6,Monica," Having a perfectly decorated tree is not what Christmas is about.
It’s about being with the people that you love."
7,Phoebe, That is nice and we’re done. TADA!
9,Chandler," I dunno what it is, it just doesn’t quite feel like Christmas to
me."
10,Monica," Oh, here."
12,Chandler, See now it feels like Christmas!
15,Ross," … and that’s the story of the dreidle. Now, some people
trace the Christmas tree back to the Egyptians, who used to bring green palm branches into
their huts on the shortest day of the year, symbolising life’s triumph over death.
And that was like 4000 years ago."
16,Rachel," So, pretty much around the same time that you started telling this
story."
18,Joey, Hey you guys.
19,Chandler, Hey Joe what’s up?
20,Joey," I had to get out of the apartment. Janine is like stretching all over the
place. Y’know, everywhere I look she’s like… (He imitates her stretching)"
21,Chandler, I can see why that’s hard to resist.
22,Joey, I like her so much!
23,Monica," Aw, I’m sorry sweetie that she doesn’t feel the same way."
24,Joey," I know. And she’s so sweet. I just wanna feed her grapes and brush
her hair."
25,Chandler," You are aware that she’s not a monkey, right?"
26,Ross," I am so over Janine. I mean, yeah, at first I thought she was hot,
but now she’s like OLD NEWS!"
29,Ross, Hi Janine!
31,Monica," Hold it! Are you talking about Dick Clark’s New Year’s
Rocking Eve?"
33,Monica," Oh my God! We love that show! I mean Ross and I have been watching it
since I can remember!"
34,Chandler," Ah, you’re still just a little fat girl inside aren’t you?
(He kisses her on the cheek)"
36,Ross, You’re gonna be a party person! Those guys rock the most!
38,Joey, Totally! I would love to spend New Year’s with you.
40,Ross," Oh, well you see how it works is, the part with Dick Clark in Times
Square is actually live, but they tape some of the party stuff ahead of time. Yeah, not a
lot of people know that."
42,Ross, Are you serious?
43,Monica, We are there!
45,Chandler," What, what are you laughing at?"
46,Rachel," Well, I used to date him, but you’re still going out with her!"
51,Ross, Bye Janine!
52,Joey, Did she just ask me out on a date?
53,Chandler, I don’t think so.
54,Monica," What are you talking about? She just invited him to the biggest party of
the millennium!"
55,Rachel," Yeah, but she also invited you and Ross. Yeah, honey, I’m sorry,
but I don’t think that was a romantic thing."
56,Joey," Oh. Maybe. But hey I know how I can find out. We’re going to a New
Year’s Eve party, right? So at midnight, I can kiss her. And if she kisses me back,
great! Y’know? But if she says ‘Dude, what the hell are you doing?’ I can
say ‘It wasn’t me, it was New Years!’"
57,Rachel," Well, that’s a lot better than Ross trying to kiss me in High
School, and saying that he did it because he needed chapstick."
58,Ross, It was a dry day.
59,Monica, We are going to Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rocking Eve!
60,Ross, Oh my God!
61,Monica, Oh my God!
62,Chandler, (To Rachel) Oh my God!
64,Joey," OK, listen I’ve been on sets before, so let me give you a little
advice, alright? It’s a show, but we’re just dancing, OK? It’s no big deal.
The important thing to remember – stay cool."
65,Ross, Got it!
67,Ross, Oh my God it’s just like I dreamed it!
72,Ross," Yeah, I have a question. When is this gonna air?"
75,Joey, Ross! So when is it gonna air?
77,Rachel," Okay, you look in the kitchen, I will look in the back closet."
78,Chandler," I can save you time ladies, I’m right here."
79,Phoebe," Yeah, Chandler why don’t you take a walk? This doesn’t concern
you."
80,Rachel, We are looking for our Christmas presents from Monica.
81,Chandler, What? That’s terrible!
82,Phoebe," No-no, we do it every year!"
83,Chandler," Oh well, that makes it not terrible."
84,Phoebe," No, yeah, we never find them! She’s always best at us that wily
minx."
85,Rachel," Don’t worry, we’re just gonna search here for an hour, them
we’re gonna go over to Joey’s and search, OK?"
86,Chandler," No not okay, you can’t look for Monica’s presents!"
87,Phoebe, But we have to!
88,Chandler," No, you don’t have to, and you can’t because I live here
too."
89,Phoebe," Well then, you should look with us."
90,Chandler, Why?
91,Rachel," Chandler, aren’t you worried about what to get Monica for
Christmas?"
92,Chandler," No, I have a great idea for a present for her."
93,Phoebe," Oh, that’s it? (Mimics Chandler) A great idea!"
94,Rachel," Chandler, that’s not enough. I mean what if she gets you a great
present, two medium presents, and a bunch of little presents? And you’ve just gotten
her one great present? I mean that’s just gonna make her feel bad. Why would you do
that to her Chandler? Why? Why?"
95,Chandler," If I help, we can find ‘em faster!"
96,Rachel, That’s right!
98,Phoebe," Ooh ooh, we have a live one!"
99,Rachel," Oh, it’s a Macy’s bag!"
101,Phoebe," Ooh, who’s it for?"
102,Rachel," (Reading) Dear losers, do you really think I’d hide
presents under the couch? P.S. Chandler, I knew they’d break you."
103,Phoebe, Uh-oh. She may be onto us.
104,Rachel, We are so gonna find them this year.
105,Chandler," Y’know when you guys said you were gonna go across the hall and
look, you don’t, you don’t do that every year do you?"
106,Rachel, Yeah.
107,Chandler," You don’t, like go into the back of my closet, and look under my
gym bag or anything?"
110,Chandler," Because that’s where Joey gave me some stuff to store that
I’ve never seen before in my life! Okay, that did not just happen! (He does a weird
clicky motion with his fingers, that kinda hard to describe.)"
112,Monica," Okay, here comes another camera."
113,Ross, Right. No biggie. Stay loose.
115,Ross, Why do they keep doing that?
116,Monica," If we wanna get on camera, I think we have to get up on one of those
platforms. They’ve been taping those people up there all day."
117,Ross, Right.
119,Ross," Hey, what’d you guys do to get up on there?"
121,Monica," Oh yeah? Well when you learned how to dance did you forget how to put on
underpants?"
122,Ross, Yeah!
125,Joey, Really?
127,Joey, What do you mean?
131,Joey, Uh-huh.
133,Joey, No-no-no-no-no we came together!
135,Joey," No-no hey buddy, please let me dance with that girl, I really like her and
I think I have a shot."
140,Chandler," I couldn't find anything at Joey--Hey-hey, oh hey!"
141,Rachel," Yeah, we found them. There were in the guest room closet behind some
coats."
142,Phoebe," Yeah, and you have nothing to worry about 'cos they're all crap!"
143,Chandler," Those are my gifts, I got them for you."
144,Phoebe, Ohhh. Thanks Chandler they're great!
145,Rachel," Well Chandler, what is this very weird, metal A Z thing?"
146,Chandler, Those are book ends! That's a great gift!
147,Phoebe," Oh, okay, I'm sorry, thank you for my azzz. "
148,Rachel, Ha!
149,Chandler," Make sure you put all that stuff back in the closet, okay?"
150,Rachel," Yes, okay, oh, by the way, I just gotta say, I think it's really nice of
you that even after you've moved, you still keep storing that stuff for Joey!"
153,Joey," Hey-hey dancer girl! Can I go to the bathroom? I just.. (The girl starts
dancing really close to him, so he picks her up, twirls her round, and puts her against a
platform) Here we go. (He walks away to find Monica and Ross doing a really out of place
dance) Looking good Gellers!"
154,Ross, We know!
155,Monica," Hey, see that snippy guy over there? He’s the one who decides who
gets up on the platform. We should go dance by him."
156,Ross, Okay.
161,Monica," Excuse me, sir, would it help if I weren’t wearing underpants?"
162,Ross, Monica! (Pause) Would it?
165,Joey," Hey! Tall guy! Hey, listen, I wanted to talk to you about that girl that
you’re dancing with."
167,Joey," Yeah, yeah, okay. Uh, look buddy, I came with that girl, and I had this
plan to kiss her at the new years countdown – I’m trying to win her over, so I
was wondering if.."
169,Joey," Oh come on man, you can dance with my partner, she’s real, uh,
mellow!"
171,Joey," Well, I was hoping after tonight that maybe I could you know…"
173,Joey," Alright, alright, hey y’know fair is fair, (he pretends to wash his
hands) if you’re right, you’re right, what can I say, but hey oh no! (He throws
water on the guy’s pants)"
175,Joey," Hey, now you’re the one who wet his pants. (He throws another handful
on him and runs out)"
177,Monica," Man, this sucks! Y’know if Mom and Dad don’t see us on TV
after we made them so jealous, I mean, who’s gonna be the losers then?"
178,Ross," Hey, I know what’ll get us up on a platform!"
179,Monica, What?
180,Ross, The routine!
181,Monica," Ross, we haven’t done the routine since middle school."
182,Ross," Hey, when the snippy guy sees the routine, he’ll wanna build
us our own platform!"
183,Monica, Was it really that good?
184,Ross," We got honourable mention in the brother/sister dance category!
Look, it’s almost fake midnight, do we really have any other choice?"
185,Monica," Okay, let’s do it. Mom and Dad are gonna be so faced!"
187,Monica, 5 6 7 8!
190,Ross," So, do we really have to ask who’s going up on the platform
next?"
192,Monica, Yes! (They run over to a platform)
197,Joey," Uh, take a look at the guy’s pants! I mean, I know you told us to
show excitement, but don’t you think he went a little overboard?"
199,Joey," Yeah, take a hike wetpants!"
202,Ross," Can you believe this? We’re gonna be on the platform for the
Millennium moment!"
203,Monica," I know! Hey, you haven’t been practising the routine, have you?"
204,Ross, No!
205,Monica, Me too!
206,Ross," Hey, when the music starts up again, I was thinking of maybe goind
into the robot, y’know? (He mimics a robot)"
207,Monica," Ross, I think we should stick to the routine, we don’t wanna look
stupid!"
212,Joey, No! Year! Happy No Year!
215,Phoebe, Hey! Look who I found!
216,Chandler," Oh, hey guys!"
217,Phoebe," Y’know, birds have a very good sense of direction, and I thought
maybe they could help us find where the presents are hidden."
218,Chandler," Yes, if the presents are hidden south for the winter."
219,Phoebe," Or we could just follow your clever jokes – any ideas? No!
Didn’t think so! Okay, c’mon guys, show us where the presents are!"
220,Chandler," Oh, the duck seems to think that Monica got me garbage! Hmm, I wonder
what I could get Monica that’s as good as garbage?"
221,Phoebe," Hmm, how about my azzz?"
223,Rachel," Hey, this is hollow."
224,Phoebe, What?
225,Rachel," This bench, it’s hollow! I can’t believe I never knew that!
(She pushes all the pillows off it and opens it up) Oh, the presents!!!"
226,Phoebe," No, don’t look directly at them!"
227,Chandler, What?
228,Phoebe," Alright, no, we could look at them!"
229,Rachel," Oh, this one’s for me!"
230,Phoebe," Oh, this one’s for Chandler. Here."
231,Chandler, Oh great!
232,Phoebe, And the big one’s for me!
233,Rachel," Ooh, let’s open them!"
234,Chandler, Okay! Okay! Okay!
235,Phoebe, Hee hee!
236,Chandler," Wait, we can’t do this."
238,Chandler," I don’t wanna know what Monica got me. Y’know? I mean, look,
I’m sure she worked really hard at getting you a present, and wanting to surprise me,
and you guys are gonna ruin that, and I, look we have to put these back, this is not what
Christmas is about."
239,Rachel," Whatever Linus, I’m opening mine."
240,Chandler," Nobody is opening anything ok? Look, I don’t know about you guys,
but I wanna see the look on Monica’s face when I give her my present, and I’m
sure she wants to see the look on my face when I get mine. So please, please, can we just,
can we put them back?"
241,Phoebe, Will you get us better gifts?
242,Chandler, Fine!
244,Monica," Hey guys! You found the presents? Chandler, you let them find the
presents? Great! Do you know how long it took me to find you that water purifier?"
245,Chandler, That’s what you got me?
246,Phoebe," Oh yes, I see what you mean. That look is priceless."
249,Joey," Home sweet home, huh? Nice to, uh, get back to reality. Plus we know how
the New Year’s gonna go off. I guess there’s no reason for all that Y2K panic,
y’know? Anyway, g’night!"
251,Joey, Yeah?
253,Joey," Oh, yoii. What was that for?"
255,Joey," Really? In the moment, I really wanted to kiss you too. In the moment."
257,Joey, But only in the moment. So do ya wanna kiss again?
259,Joey, No.
261,Joey," 3, 2, "
263,Joey," Uh, yeah, okay. Except I sorta felt like I needed a couple of seconds to
get ready."
267,Monica," We were on the platform, ready to dance the world into the new
Millennium, and the guy yelled ‘CUT!’"
268,Rachel," Uh, wait, so you guys are telling me you actually did the routine from
eighth grade?"
269,Monica," Yeah. But of course we had to update it a little bit. (To Ross) Hey, by
the way, great thinking about catching me!"
270,Rachel," ‘Cos I was gonna say there’s no way you could’ve done the
end the way you guys did it back then!"
271,Monica, What? We could do it!
272,Ross," I don’t know, I mean you were a lot bigger, I mean, stronger
back then."
273,Monica," I can do it, okay? Come on, let’s go. (She and Ross get up)"
275,Monica, I can’t do it! (Ross falls into Monica’s room)
276,Chandler," Now you do that, you’re on TV."
0,Joey, Hey!
1,Ross, Hey!
2,Joey," Listen, do you guys think I have a chance with Janine?"
3,Monica," Honey, we have been through this before!"
4,Rachel, Yeah. Don’t do this to yourself.
5,Phoebe," She’s made it pretty clear, it is not going to happen."
6,Joey," Well all right then, I guess I shouldn’t get to excited about the
fact (excitedly) that I just kissed her!"
7,Monica, You serious?!
8,Chandler, That’s great!
9,Monica, Really?!
10,Phoebe," Yeah well, we’ll see."
11,Ross, You kissed her.
12,Joey, Oh we kissed it up real nice.
13,Chandler," So you kissed her, so what happened after that?"
14,Joey, I came over here to tell you guys.
15,Chandler, So she’s just waiting over there for ya?
20,Joey, Okay. (They kiss.)
22,Joey, Okay. (They kiss.)
24,Joey," Okay, I’m all right, okay, but hey, could you just leave your lips?
(She kisses him on the cheek and starts to leave.)"
26,Monica, Bye. (Janine exits.)
27,Joey," Have you kissed her yet? It’s awesome! I could do it forever!
Y’know what? She-she kisses better than my mom cooks!"
28,Monica, I am so glad you said cooks.
29,Rachel, I know.
30,Chandler," (entering) Oh hey Rachel, sweetheart? You have got to tell the
post office that you have moved. Okay? We are still getting all your bills and stuff.
(Hands her all of her bills and stuff.)"
31,Rachel," Oh-oh, Pottery Barn! (Grabs the aforementioned catalog and holds
the rest back out to Chandler.) You can throw the rest away."
32,Chandler, I’m not your garbage man. I’m your mailman.
33,Rachel," Monica look! Look-look-look! Here is that table that I ordered. (Shows
her the picture.)"
34,Monica, You got it from Pottery Barn?!
35,Rachel," Yeah! It’s an apothecary table. Does anyone even know what an
apothecary is?"
36,Chandler, A pharmacist. (Rachel mocks him.)
37,Monica," Rach, Phoebe hates Pottery Barn."
38,Joey," I hate Pottery Barn too. They kicked me out of there just because I
sat on a bed!"
39,Chandler, You took off your pants and climbed under the sheets!
40,Joey, (indignant) I was tired!
41,Rachel, Phoebe hates Pottery Barn?!
42,Monica," Yeah, she hates all mass produced stuff. She thinks her furniture should
have a history, a story behind it."
43,Rachel," Well this has story behind it! I mean they had to ship it all the way
from the White Plains store."
44,Monica," It’s gotta be one of a kind. Y’know like umm, y’know uh,
what’s that God awful ceramic fruit bowl she has on her counter?"
45,Joey, Hey! I made that for her!
46,Chandler, You made pottery?
47,Joey, Yeah! I made it of this fruit bowl I found in the garbage.
48,Monica," I’m telling—If you put that in her apartment you’ll never
hear the end of it."
49,Rachel," Okay fine! I’ll-I’ll just tell her it’s an antique
apothecary table, she doesn’t have to know where it came from. Oh! Look at this
little drawers! Oh look-look it says that it holds 300 CDs."
50,Chandler," Ahh, just like the apothecary tables of yore…"
52,Chandler," …so then the farmer says, ""That’s not a cow and
you’re not milking it."" (Everyone laughs.) "
53,Monica," I am so glad you guys got together, Chandler and I are always looking
for a couple to go out with and now we have one!"
54,Chandler," Look at us, we’re a couple of couples!"
56,Monica, Yeah.
57,Joey," And Chandler I can’t believe I let you pay for this one. (They hug
and he whispers in his ear.) Thanks man."
58,Monica," So do you guys gonna come over tomorrow? I’ll make that pasta thing
I was telling you about."
60,Joey," Oh, but hey look, at least let us bring the wine."
61,Monica," Joey, you don’t have too!"
62,Joey," Nope-op! I insist! (He hugs Chandler again and whispers to him.) You get
the wine right?"
63,Chandler," Yeah all right. (They part.) Okay, good night guys."
64,Joey, See ya tomorrow!
65,Monica, Tomorrow!
69,Joey, What?
71,Joey, What-what’s wrong with Monica and Chandler?
73,Joey, Blah?!
75,Joey," Uh, they’re like my best friends. Are you saying we can’t hang
out with them? ‘Cause that would kinda be a problem."
77,Joey, I guess.
79,Joey," If you want, I’ll sell my friends and use the money to buy you
presents."
81,Phoebe, Hey!
82,Rachel, Hey!
83,Phoebe," (sees the table) Ooh, what a great table! Where-where did you get it?"
84,Rachel, Guess!
85,Phoebe," Umm, a flea market?"
86,Rachel," Ha! See, I knew, I knew you’d get it on the first guess. Isn’t
it cool! It’s an apothecary table."
87,Phoebe," Wow! Oh you can just imagine that this is where (She’s opening and
closing the drawers) they kept all the stuff to make their potions."
88,Rachel," Ohh, yes."
89,Phoebe," Y’know? Ooh, you can almost smell the opium."
90,Rachel, Almost.
91,Phoebe, How much was it?
92,Rachel, It was only 500 bucks.
93,Phoebe, 500 bucks at a flea market?!
94,Rachel," Oh, okay see I thought, I thought you meant how much was it when it was
new, y’know like back then."
95,Phoebe, Oh no.
96,Rachel," Yeah no, I mean it was at a flea market, so it was y’know, it was
like a dollar."
97,Phoebe, A dollar?
98,Rachel, And fifty. So it was like one and fifty dollars.
99,Phoebe," Ohh, okay, they gave you the old time pricing."
100,Rachel, Yeah.
101,Phoebe," Well, what period is it from?"
102,Rachel," Uh, it’s from yore. Like the days of yore. Y’know?"
103,Phoebe," Yes, yes I do. God, oh it’s just perfect! Wow! I bet it has a great
story behind it too. Did they tell you anything? Like y’know where it was from
or…"
104,Rachel," Yes! That I know, this is from White Plains."
105,Phoebe," (gasps) White Plains. Oh, it sounds like such a magical place."
107,Rachel, Hey! We’re here!
108,Ross, Hey!
109,Rachel, (seeing his new table) Ohh! Oh my God!
110,Ross, You like it? 
111,Rachel, Oh no!
112,Ross, It’s my new apothecary table!
113,Rachel," Ross! Phoebe’s gonna be here any second, she cannot see this!"
114,Ross," Well why not?! She’ll-she’ll love it! It’s the real thing!
I got it at Pottery Barn."
115,Rachel," I know you did! I bought the same one! And if she sees your table
she’s gonna know that I lied to her. I told her ours was an original."
116,Ross, Why did you do that?
117,Rachel, Because she hates Pottery Barn.
118,Ross, She hates Pottery Barn?!!
119,Rachel," I know! I know, she says it’s all mass-produced, nothing is
authentic, and everyone winds up having the same stuff. (Ross looks at his table.) So come
on, she’s gonna be here any second! Can we please just cover this up with something?!
Please?"
120,Ross," What? No! No! I am not gonna hide it from Phoebe—Ooh, although I did
get some great Pottery Barn sheets! (Gets them.)"
121,Rachel," Ooo! Oh, I forgot they made sheets!"
122,Ross," Uh, yeah! I still can’t believe she hates Pottery Barn!"
123,Rachel," Ross, get over it! It’s not like she hates you."
124,Ross," Yeah but Pottery Barn! Y’know what I think? It’s just
she-she’s weird. Y’know it’s because she’s a twin. Twins are weird."
125,Rachel," Ross, she’s not weird, she just wants her stuff to be one of a
kind."
126,Ross, Huh. Y’know what’s not one of a kind? A twin!
127,Phoebe, (entering) Hey!
128,Rachel, Hey!
129,Ross, Hey!
130,Rachel," Ooh, Phoebe’s here! Okay, let’s turn out all the lights and
we’ll just watch the movie!"
131,Phoebe," Okay. Hey—Ooh, cool sheets! (Notices the sheet over the table.) "
132,Ross," Oh, you like it? You wanna know where I got it? "
133,Phoebe, Sure!
134,Rachel, He got it a flea market!
135,Phoebe," You bought your sheets at a flea market? Ross come on, you gotta loosen
the purse strings a little."
137,Monica, Hey!
138,Joey, Hi!
139,Monica, The dinner will be ready in twenty minutes. This is so exciting.
140,Chandler," And here is the bottle of wine for you to bring over tonight. (Hands
it to him.) You were also going to buy Monica flowers but you couldn’t afford it,
because you paid dinner last night."
141,Joey," Thanks. Thanks, but uh actually it’s just gonna be me again tonight."
142,Monica, What happened to Janine?
143,Joey," Oh, she’s uh-uh really sick."
144,Chandler, Oh that’s too bad.
145,Joey," Yeah, she’s been in there all day (Points to her room), uh high
fever, a nose problem… Phlegm! Phlegm! Phlegm-phlegm-phlegm!"
147,Joey, ‘Kay!
149,Chandler," That’s funny, I saw no phlegm."
152,Joey," No-no, she really is sick!"
153,Chandler, Then why-why is she going to a play?!
154,Joey," Uh, y’know, starve a fever, go to a play for a cold."
155,Monica, Joey! Why is Janine not coming over for dinner?!
156,Joey," Well uh, she didn’t want to hang out with you guys two nights in a
row. I’m so sorry."
157,Chandler," Well, why does she not want to hang out with us?!"
158,Joey," Because she uh, she-she thinks that you are blah and that you, Monica, are
too loud."
159,Monica, (loudly) What?!! (Quietly) What?
160,Chandler," So she was just pretending to have a good time last night? She was
lying to our faces?!"
161,Monica," Ugh, I can not believe this! I mean, who is she to judge us? We could
not have been nicer to her!"
162,Chandler," And I am not blah, I am a hoot!"
163,Joey," I know! I know! Come on, please-please you guys, don’t-don’t be
mad. I’m sure she just, she just said that stuff because she was nervous and you guys
are like my best friends! Y’know? And it was our first date! Plus, she’s really
sick!"
164,Chandler," No, you sh—No you said you made that up!!"
165,Joey," I know, but don’t you think the sick thing is way better than the
play thing?"
166,Chandler," Eh, they’re both good. I generally just go with, Monica’s
drunk again. (Monica glares at him.) "
167,Joey," Come on you guys, come on please-please just give her another chance, huh?
She’ll come around I promise."
168,Monica," Of course we will, come on we gotta make dinner."
169,Chandler, Okay.
171,Monica, (from the hallway) I do not like that woman!
172,Joey, (shouting) I can hear you!
173,Monica, I am loud!
176,Rachel, That’s funny. (Phoebe puts her feet up on Ross’s table.)
177,Ross," Hey Pheebs, could you please not put your feet up on my new…(On
Rachel’s glare)…old sheet?"
178,Phoebe," Oh sure! (She goes to take her feet off, but drags the sheet with her
which spills the wine.) Noo!"
179,Rachel, Ohh!!
180,Ross, My apothecary table!!!
181,Phoebe, What?!
182,Rachel," Noooooo!! (Phoebe lifts up the sheet to discover the exact same
apothecary table they have.) "
183,Phoebe," Ross, where did you get this?!"
184,Ross, I got it at Pottery Barn!! Okay?!
185,Rachel," Oh my God, Phoebe, Pottery Barn has ripped off the design of our
antique!"
186,Phoebe," Wow! Oh my God, well if they’ve ripped off our table ours must be
much more than one and fifty dollars!"
187,Rachel, Oh yes.
188,Phoebe, Well this doesn’t even smell like opium.
189,Ross," Of course not, it smells like wine, which you spilled! And thanks for
wrecking my sheet by the way."
190,Phoebe," Oh Ross, calm down, I’ll give you the 80 cents. (Ross glares at
Rachel)"
192,Chandler," Okay, one more time."
193,Monica," Chandler, would you like some more orange juice?"
194,Chandler, Perfect decibel.
195,Monica, (loudly) I know!!!
196,Joey, (entering) Hey!
197,Chandler, Hey.
198,Joey," So uh, what are you guys doing?"
199,Chandler," Oh nothing, we’re just talking. Y’know, blah-blah-blah."
200,Joey," Look, come on you guys, you said you were gonna try! All right look, I
came over here to invite you guys to a movie with me and Janine."
201,Monica," Well, I’d like to but, (extremely quietly) I’m not sure we
have time to go."
202,Joey," Ha-ha, very funny—Look! I don’t know what to do! I really want
you guys to get along. Just please come to the movie with us. I mean you owe me!"
203,Monica, We owe you?!
204,Joey," That’s right! I helped you guys out a lot in the start of your
relationship. Huh? I helped you guys sneak around for like six months, and I looked like
an idiot! And I was humiliated. And I only made 200 dollars!"
205,Monica," We didn’t give you any money! (Chandler is motioning,
""No!"")"
206,Joey, You don’t think I know that!
208,Rachel," …see I can’t decide whether it would go better next to the new
wicker dining chair, the Sahara desk, or the Parker console table."
209,Ross, Wow! I didn’t know that there was a Pottery Barn up here.
210,Rachel," I know, I know. I went a little crazy."
211,Ross," A little? Your place looks like page 72 of the catalogue. Oh look at that!
The ornamental bird cage! Large!"
212,Phoebe, (entering) Hey!
213,Rachel, Hey.
214,Phoebe," (sees Ross) Oh Ross no. Be careful, that is very old! Okay? Early
Colonial bird merchants used to bring their birds to market in that."
215,Ross, (glaring at Rachel) Fascinating.
216,Phoebe, (gasps) Another amazing find! Wow! Oh I bet this has a great story too!
217,Rachel," Oh it does, it does! It is a room separating apparatus from Colonial
times."
218,Phoebe, Ah!
219,Ross," Hmm, a lot of this stuff is from Colonial times. Hey, what are some other
time periods Rachel? (She glares at him.)"
220,Rachel," Well there’s yore. And uh, y’know, yesteryear."
221,Phoebe," Yeah no, I’m telling you Rachel has such a great eye for this
stuff. Ross, y’know if you ever decide you need to redecorate—And I think that
you should. You should, you should ask Rachel to help."
222,Rachel, Oh honey he doesn’t need my help.
223,Phoebe," Oh, come on! I think he’s ready to get rid of, what did you call
it? The cheap knock-offs and dinosaur junk."
224,Ross," Really?! (To Rachel) Hey, y’know what? Since you have such a great
sense of what I need, uh ooh, here’s-here’s 60 bucks, why don’t you take
Phoebe down to that Colonial flea market of yours and get me some stuff."
225,Rachel," (not sure of what to do) Y’know what? I don’t, I don’t
think Phoebe really wants to come."
226,Phoebe, No! I do want to!
227,Rachel," Oh, she does want to."
228,Ross, She does want to.
229,Phoebe, Yeah!
231,Rachel," Pheebs, I don’t know what to say. I guess the flea market was just
better last time."
232,Phoebe, Well at least I got these sheets for Ross.
233,Rachel, Yeah.
235,Phoebe," Uck, look at this! Pottery Barn, yuck!"
236,Rachel," Yeah, y’know what? Don’t look at it. (Realizes the display is
their living room) Seriously, don’t look at it. (Tries to pull Phoebe away.)"
237,Phoebe, No! Look-look! There’s the coffee table they stole from us!
238,Rachel," Ugh, those bastards! Let’s go."
239,Phoebe," That fan kinda looks like ours. And the birdcage and the…wait a
sec! This is our exact living room!"
240,Rachel," No! No! No! No it’s not! No it’s not! Come on! Phoebe, ours is
totally different! I mean we don’t have the… (Looks desperately for something
different.) We don’t have the…that lamp! And-and that screen is y’know, on
the other side."
241,Phoebe," Oh my God. This is where you got all our stuff, Pottery Barn! Oh
my God!"
242,Rachel," Okay! Okay-okay look—no I did, I just wanted this stuff and I know
how you feel about Pottery Barn. Just… Come on don’t be mad."
243,Phoebe," No-no-no, but I am mad! I am mad! Because this stuff is everything that
is wrong with the world! And it’s all sitting up in my living room and all I can
think about is how I don’t have that lamp!"
244,Rachel," Well then honey, buy the lamp! Hey, we have that 60 bucks from Ross."
245,Phoebe," I can’t! I can’t! Unless… Well are you saying that-that
you would move out if-if I didn’t buy that lamp?"
246,Rachel, What?! No! I’m not gonna move out!
247,Phoebe," But are you saying that you would move out if I didn’t buy that
lamp?"
248,Rachel, (gets it) Oh. Yes! I would so move out!
249,Phoebe, Okay then I don’t have a choice! I have to buy that lamp!
250,Rachel, That’s right!
252,Phoebe, But at least the apothecary table is real.
254,Joey," Well, this-this-this was great. Didn’t everybody have a great time?"
256,Chandler, That’s totally understandable.
257,Monica, Don’t worry about it.
259,Chandler, Oh yeah!
260,Monica, Absolutely!
262,Joey," Oh well then, good night!"
263,Monica, Good night! (They go into their respective apartments.)
265,Joey," See? Eh, wasn’t that fun?"
267,Monica," (bursting in) I knew it!! Y’know, you’re not so quiet
yourself, missy!"
268,Chandler," And I’m blah? Listen, the only thing more boring than watching
modern dance is having to listen to you talk about it, (Imitating her) ""Oh Chandler,
I just lost myself in the moment."""
270,Monica," (steps up and points at her) All right! You and me! Let’s go! Right
now!"
271,Joey," All right! All right! Enough! Enough! Enough!! Enough! (To Chandler and
Monica) You two go home! I-I-I gotta talk to Janine! (They start to leave.)"
272,Chandler, (To Monica) Y’know I think you can take her.
273,Monica," (to Janine) You’d better hope I don’t see you in the hallway!!
(They exit.)"
274,Joey," All right, uh, we’ve got a little bit of a problem here. These people
are my friends; you can’t treat them that way."
276,Joey," I know! I know! And I’m going to talk to them about it. They mean so
much to me. They… They’re like my family. If you guys are gonna be fighting all
the time, I-I… I don’t think we can be together. It just, it just can’t
work. It can’t. (Starts to break up) I’m very upset."
278,Joey," Yeah! Yeah! That would be very helpful! Yeah. (He opens the door for her
and she exits into the hallway.)"
280,Monica, What did I tell you about the hall?!
282,Monica," Well, I know that would make Joey happy, so, I would like that too."
284,Monica," Now come on. (They hug like men.) Well, I’m glad we worked things
out."
286,Monica, Okay.
288,Monica, Bye. (Leaves to resume her garbage removal task.)
290,Monica," (hearing that) That’s it big girl! (Hits Janine in the butt with
the garbage bag) Come on!"
292,Monica, (chasing her) You’d better run! 
294,Chandler, Did you hear that?
295,Joey," Yeah uh, what am I gonna do?"
296,Chandler," Yeah, I’m sorry man. (Pause) You wanna go watch?"
297,Joey, Yeah! (They head downstairs.)
300,Ross, Hey!
301,Joey, How ya doin’?
302,Chandler," Hey so, did uh, did she move out?"
303,Joey," Pretty much, yeah."
304,Monica, I cannot believe you broke up with her just like that.
305,Joey," Well, when it’s not right, you know it."
306,Chandler, You okay?
307,Joey, Yeah! Yeah. I’ll be all right.
308,Ross, Y’know what would cheer you up?
309,Joey, What?
310,Ross," I’m giving this lecture on erosion theories tomorrow night, I think
you should come."
311,Joey, (laughing hysterically) You’re right! That did cheer me up!
0,Ross," Hey, you’re not going to believe this. I made up a joke and sent it
in to Playboy. They printed it!"
1,Phoebe, I didn’t know Playboy prints jokes.
2,Ross," Yeah, they print jokes, interviews, hard-hitting journalism. It’s not
just about the pictures."
3,Monica," That didn’t work on mom, it’s not going to work on us."
4,Ross," (showing them the page) Here, check it out. It’s the first
one, too."
6,Chandler, That is funny. It was also funny when I made it up.
7,Ross, What?
8,Chandler, I made that joke up.
9,Ross," Uh, oh-oh, no you didn’t. I did."
10,Chandler," Yes, I did. I told it to Dan at work, and he said it was the funniest
joke he’d ever heard."
11,Ross," Hey, tell Dan, ‘Thanks.’"
13,Ross, What?
14,Rachel," I’m sorry, I was just reading the joke below it. Man, that one is
funny. (Ross grabs the magazine away from her.)"
15,Chandler," Monica, you remember me telling you that joke, right?"
16,Monica, No.
17,Chandler, Seriously?
18,Monica," Well, you tell a lot of jokes!"
19,Ross," Look, Chandler, it’s my joke. But, hey, if it makes you feel any
better they don’t print the name, so it doesn’t really matter who gets credit,
right?"
20,Chandler," Yeah, I guess."
21,Joey, (entering) Hey guys.
22,Chandler," (jumping up from his chair) Hey, Joey, Playboy
printed my joke."
23,Ross," No, it’s my joke, it’s mine. You can call them, they’ll
tell you."
24,Chandler, It’s my joke.
25,Ross, It’s my joke.
26,Joey," Whoa-whoa-whoa. Jokes? You guys know they have naked chicks in there,
right?"
29,Chandler," Dude, you have got to turn on Behind the Music. The band Heart
is having a really tough time, and I think they may break up."
30,Joey, Let’s go watch it at your place.
31,Chandler," Nah, Monica’s watching some cooking show. Come on, I don’t
want to miss when they were skinny."
32,Joey," Chandler, Chandler, y’know what we should do? You and I should go out
and get some new sunglasses."
33,Chandler," What? No, I want to watch this. (He turns on the television and the
screen is completely covered in snow). Did your cable go out?"
34,Joey," No, that’s VH-1. I gotta tell you, the music these kids listen
to today . . . It’s like a lotta noise to me. I don’t know…"
35,Chandler," Joey, why is your cable out?"
36,Joey," I uh, oh! Because, uh, I haven’t really paid the bill"
37,Chandler," If you need money, will you please-please just let me loan you some
money?"
38,Joey," No, Chandler. Look, forget about it, okay? Look, I know things have been a
little tight since Janine moved out. Oh, was she hot. "
39,Chandler, Whoa ho.
40,Joey," I know! Yeah, but, look I can handle it. All right? Look, I can listen to
the radio, huh? And Ross gave me this great book (holds up the Playboy magazine)."
41,Chandler," (picks up the phone) All right, you want to see if the joke stealer
will let us watch the show at his place?"
42,Joey, Sure.
43,Chandler," (with phone to ear, obviously hearing no dial tone) Paid your phone
bill?"
44,Joey, Not so much.
46,Phoebe, (entering) Hey.
47,Monica, (relieved) It’s only you.
48,Phoebe, Wh-wh-what are you doing?
49,Rachel, We are looking at a Playboy.
50,Phoebe," Oh, I want to look too! (She runs over and sits down and checks out a
picture). Yikes!"
51,Monica," So do you think that these pictures—Are, are they trying to tell a
story?"
52,Rachel," Oh, yeah, sure. I mean, like in the case of this young woman, she has
lost her clothes, so she rides naked on the horse, she’s crying out, ‘Where are
they, where are they?’"
53,Monica," Well, she’s not going to find them lying in the grass like that."
55,Phoebe," Oh, yeah. Aw, remember the days when you used to go out to the barn,
lift up your shirt, and bend over?"
57,Rachel," You see, now, I would date this girl. She’s cute, she’s
outdoorsy, you know, and she knows how to build a fire. I mean, that’s got to come in
handy"
58,Monica," Okay, I’ve got a question. If you had to pick one of us to date,
who would it be?"
59,Rachel, (thinks) I don’t know.
60,Monica, Me neither.
61,Phoebe, Rachel.
62,Monica, What?!
63,Phoebe, I don’t know. (Pause) Me neither.
65,Joey, You forget how many great songs Heart had.
66,Chandler, Yeah.
67,Ross," You know, Barracuda was the first song I learned to play on the keyboard."
68,Chandler," So, you heard it, you repeated it, so that must mean you wrote it."
69,Joey," Oh, you guys, with this joke. I gotta say, I know I cracked up, but
I’m not even sure I got it."
70,Ross," What, you didn’t get it? The doctor is a monkey."
72,Chandler, And monkeys can’t write out prescriptions.
74,Chandler," (stops laughing, to Ross) You are not allowed to laugh at my joke."
75,Ross," Your joke? Well, I think ‘the Hef’ would disagree, which is why
he sent me a check for one hundred ah-dollars."
76,Chandler," So, you stole my joke, and you stole my money."
77,Ross," Well, I was going to stick it in the ATM, but now I think I’ll show
the sexy teller that I am a published writer."
78,Chandler," Well, she is going to know that you stole the joke."
79,Ross," Oh, what are you going to do, follow me down there?"
80,Chandler, Yeah!
81,Ross," Well, I’m not going to go now anyway (he goes to sit down)."
82,Chandler, Okay (he goes to sit down).
85,Joey," Ah, Gunther, I can’t pay for this right now because I’m not
working, so I’ve had to cut down on some luxuries like uh, payin’ for stuff."
87,Joey," Uh, I don’t know. Ya see, it’s just, see I was a regular on a
soap opera y’know? And to go from that to this, I just… Plus, I’d have to
wait on all my friends."
89,Joey, What?!
91,Joey, Maybe I could be a waiter. Could I use the phone?
93,Monica," (visibly upset) She picked Rachel. I mean, she tried to back out of it,
but it was obvious. She picked Rachel."
94,Chandler," (visibly upset) He took my joke, he took it. "
95,Monica, It’s wrong. You know what else is wrong? Phoebe picking Rachel.
96,Chandler," You know who else picked Rachel? Ross, and you know what else Ross
did? He stole my joke. You know what? I’m going to get a joke journal. Y’know?
And document the date and time of every single one of my jokes."
97,Monica, That’s a good idea. 
98,Chandler, Yeah!
99,Monica, Do you know what’s a bad idea?
100,Chandler, Picking Rachel.
101,Monica," That’s right. (A noise comes from the living room.) Did you hear
something?"
102,Chandler," Maybe it’s the sound of Ross climbing into my brain and stealing
my thoughts."
103,Monica, It’s coming from the living room.
105,Joey," (sheepishly) I finished my book. (Chandler and Monica slowly retreat back
to bed.)"
107,Monica," (entering) Hey, you guys."
109,Monica," (laughing) Oh, don’t you guys look cute. You guys make
such a cute couple."
110,Rachel," Monica, what are you doing?"
111,Monica," (laughing harder) Nothing, I’m just trying to recreate
some of the fun that we had at my place the other day. (To Phoebe) Remember, when you
picked Rachel over me? That was funny."
112,Phoebe, I guess it was kinda funny.
113,Monica," (angrily) It wasn’t funny at all! Why would you do that?
Why didn’t you pick me?"
114,Phoebe," Fine. The reason that I was leaning a little bit more toward Rachel than
you is just that you’re … just … kinda high maintenance—Okay
let’s go to lunch!"
115,Monica," That is completely untrue. You think I’m high maintenance? Okay,
prove it. I want you to make a list and we’re going to go through it point by point!"
116,Phoebe," No, okay, you’re right. You’re easy-going. You’re just
not as easy-going as Rachel. She’s just more flexible and-and mellow. That’s
all."
117,Rachel," (To Monica) Well, people are different."
118,Phoebe," Ya, you know, Rachel … she’ll do whatever you want.
Y’know, you can just walk all over her."
119,Rachel," What? Wait a minute. What are you saying, that I’m a pushover?
I’m not a pushover."
120,Phoebe," Oh, okay, (laughing) you’re not a pushover."
121,Rachel," Oh my … you think I’m a pushover. Well wait, watch this, you
know what? You’re not invited to lunch. What do you think of that? I think
that’s pretty strong, that’s what I think. Come on, Monica, let’s go to
lunch. (She leaves)"
122,Monica," (to Phoebe) You start working on that list. (She grabs her
coat and leaves, too.)"
124,Rachel, I cannot believe her.
125,Monica, I know. Where do you wanna go eat?
126,Rachel," Oh, oh, I love that Japanese place."
127,Monica, I’m sick of Japanese. We’re not going there.
128,Rachel," All right, wherever you wanna go is cool."
129,Monica, All right.
131,Ross," (showing the Playboy magazine to Gunther) Oh, hey, Gunther, check this
out."
135,Joey," Hey Ross, listen, you want anything to drink, ‘cause I’m heading
up there."
136,Ross," Uh, yeah, I’ll take a coffee. Thanks, man."
137,Joey, Sure. (To Monica and Rachel) Coffee? ‘Cause I’m going up there. 
138,Rachel, No.
139,Monica," No, thank you."
140,Joey," (to a table of strangers) You guys need anything, ‘cause I’m
heading up there. "
142,Joey, You got it.
143,Monica," Joey, what are you doing?"
144,Joey," Just being friendly. (He gives Monica a ‘what’s wrong with
you?’ look and proceeds to walk behind the counter.)"
145,Rachel," Joey, honey, I don’t think you’re supposed to go back there."
146,Joey," Nah, it’s okay. Right, Gunther? (Winks at him as if they’re in
on a secret together.)"
148,Joey," Okay, but I don’t see you asking any other paying customers to put on
aprons. "
149,Monica," Joey, do you work here?"
150,Joey, No.
152,Joey, Yeah?
155,Monica," Joey, what’s going on. What didn’t you tell us you work here?"
156,Joey," It’s kind of embarrassing, y’know. I mean, I was an actor and
now I’m a waiter. It’s supposed to go in the other direction."
157,Chandler, So is your apron. You’re wearing it like a cape.
158,Joey," I mean, the job’s easy and the money’s good, you know? I guess
I’m going to be hanging out here anyway. I might as well get paid for it, right? I
just feel kind of weird serving you guys."
159,Rachel," Come on, Joey, I did it and it was fine."
160,Ross," Yeah, why would it be weird? Hey, Joey, can I get some coffee?"
161,Joey," Okay, I guess it doesn’t seem that weird."
162,Ross," Seriously, I-I asked you before and you still haven’t gotten it."
163,Joey," See, now it’s weird again."
164,Chandler," I think it’s great that you work here. You’re going to make
a lot of money, and here’s your first tip Don’t eat yellow snow. (He laughs,
then picks up a pen, glares at Ross, and writes in his journal). Ah ha ha, 215,
coffeehouse."
165,Rachel," Well, you know what? This is great. Finally, I have someone I can pass
on my wisdom too. Let me tell you about a couple of things I learned while working at the
coffeehouse. First of all, the customer is always right. (Joey nods.) A smile goes a long
way. (Joey smiles) And if anyone is ever rude to you? Sneeze muffin."
166,Joey," Thanks, Rach. Look, you guys are just terrific. Y’know? Now, how
about clearing out of here so I can get some new customers. It’s all about turnover."
167,Ross," Joey, seriously, can I get my coffee?"
168,Joey," Oh, I’m sorry, Ross. I’ll get it for you right now. And since I
made you wait, I’ll toss in a free muffin."
171,Rachel, Phoebe. We would like to talk to you for a second.
172,Phoebe, Okay.
173,Monica," So, maybe I am a little high maintenance. And maybe Rachel is a little
bit of a pushover. But you know what we decided you are?"
174,Rachel," Yes, we are very sorry to tell you this, but you, Phoebe, are flaky."
175,Monica, Hah!
176,Phoebe," That true, I am flaky."
177,Rachel," So, what, you’re just, you’re just okay with being flaky?"
178,Phoebe," Yeah, totally."
179,Monica," Well, then, I’m okay with being high maintenance."
180,Rachel," Yeah, and I am okay with being a pushover."
181,Phoebe, That’s great. Good for you guys.
182,Monica, I am not high maintenance!
183,Rachel, I am not a pushover!
184,Phoebe, Who said you were?
186,Phoebe," Oh, I’m flaky. I’ll say anything."
188,Joey," Hey, Gunther. Can you uh, can you cover for me? I just got an audition."
190,Joey," Really?! I like your natural color. Come on man, it’s a great part.
Look, check it out. I’m the lead guy’s best friend and I wait for him in this
bar and save his seat. Listen-listen. ‘I’m sorry, that seat’s saved.’"
192,Joey,
194,Joey," Oh, man, I could totally get that part. ‘I’m sorry, that seat is
taken.’"
196,Joey," No, no, I didn’t mean you. But, you believed me, huh?"
198,Joey," So, you’d hire me, right?"
200,Joey," Exactly! All right, everybody, listen up. The coffeehouse is going to be
closed for about an hour. "
202,Joey," Yeah, it’s for the kids. To keep the kids off drugs. It’s a very
important issue in this month’s Playboy. I’m sure you all read about it."
204,Ross, It’s my joke.
205,Chandler, It’s my joke.
207,Ross," Y’know, I don’t think we’re going to settle this."
208,Chandler, Let’s have Monica decide.
209,Ross, Yeah!
210,Chandler, Yeah!
211,Ross, Hey Mon.
212,Chandler," Mon, get out here!"
213,Ross," Monica! (She appears, not sure why she was summoned.)"
214,Chandler," Okay, okay. You have to help us decide whose joke this is."
215,Monica, Why do I have to decide?
216,Chandler, Because you’re the only one that can be fair.
217,Ross, Yeah.
218,Monica, I can’t be fair. You’re my boyfriend.
219,Ross," Yeah, but I’m your brother. We’re family. That’s the most
important thing in the world."
220,Chandler," (to Ross) Don’t try to sway her. (To Monica) (Softly) I’m
your only chance to have a baby. Okay, let’s go."
221,Ross," We’ll each tell you how we came up with the joke and then you decide
which one of us is telling the truth—me. "
222,Monica," Okay, Chandler, you go first."
223,Chandler," Okay, I thought of the joke two months ago at lunch with Steve."
224,Monica," Oh, wait, is he the guy I met at Christmas?"
225,Chandler, Can I finish my story?!
226,Monica, Do you want me to pick you?!
227,Ross," See, I would never snap at you like that."
229,Monica, Continue.
230,Chandler," So Steve said he had to go to the doctor. And Steve’s
doctor’s name is Doctor Muppy. So I said, ‘Doctor Monkey?’ And that is how
the whole Doctor Monkey thing came up. (He slams his feet up on the table to emphasize his
point.)"
231,Ross," Are you kidding? Okay, look. I-I studied evolution. Remember, evolution?
Monkey into man? Plus, I’m a doctor, and I had a monkey. I’m Doctor Monkey!"
232,Chandler, I’m not arguing with that.
233,Monica," All right, I’ve heard enough. I’ve made my decision."
235,Monica," You are both idiots. The joke is not funny, and it’s offensive to
women, and doctors, and monkeys! You shouldn’t be arguing over who gets credit, you
should be arguing over who gets blamed for inflicting this horrible joke upon the world!
Now let it go! The joke sucks! "
237,Ross, It’s your joke.
238,Chandler, Is not.
240,Monica," Hi, Chandler. There you are."
241,Chandler," Hi, oh hi."
242,Monica," Hey, it’s Phoebe and Rachel. Um, why don’t you tell them what
you were telling me earlier about me not being high maintenance?"
244,Chandler," (starts to recite a rehearsed speech) Monica is a self-sufficient,
together lady. (Pause.) Being with her has been like being on a vacation. And what may be
perceived as high maintenance is merely attention to detail and—(He falters and
Monica prompts him.)—generosity of spirit."
245,Rachel," Wow, you know what? That is the best fake speech I think I’ve ever
heard."
246,Phoebe, Really? I’ve heard better.
247,Monica," Wait, wait, he came up with that himself. Tell them, Chandler."
248,Chandler," (To Chandler) I’m out of words. Should I just say the whole thing
again?"
249,Monica," Look, I am not high maintenance. I am not. Chandler!"
250,Chandler," (pauses as he struggles with what he has to say) You’re a little
high maintenance."
251,Monica, Ahhh! You are on my list.
252,Chandler," I’m sorry. You’re not easy-going, but you’re
passionate, and that’s good. And when you get upset about the little things, I think
that I’m pretty good about making you feel better about that. And that’s good
too. So, they can say that you’re high maintenance, but it’s okay, because I
like … maintaining you."
253,Monica," (embarrassed) (To Phoebe and Rachel) I didn’t even tell him to say
that. (They hug). All right you’re off my list. "
254,Chandler, (happily) I’m off the list. (Sits on the couch.) 
255,Monica," (sits next to him) Phoebe, it’s okay that you don’t want me to
be your girlfriend because I have the best boyfriend."
256,Phoebe," (to Monica) Y’know, suddenly I find you very attractive."
258,Chandler," Hey, buddy boy, how’d the audition go?"
259,Joey," Not good, no. I didn’t get the part, and I lost my job here, so
…"
260,Phoebe, Wow! That is a bad audition.
261,Rachel, How-how did you lose your job here?
262,Joey," Well, I had the audition but Gunther said I had to stay here and be in
charge so he could go get his hair dyed. So, I went anyway, and then he fired me."
263,Rachel," He left work in the middle of the day to do a personal errand and left
you in charge when you’ve been working here two days? That’s not, that’s
not right."
264,Joey," Yeah, what are ya gonna do?"
265,Rachel," Joey, you can’t let him get away with that. Ya know what, I’m
not going to let him get away with that. I’m going to say something to him—No, I
really shouldn’t say anything—No, I should say something to him. (Goes to the
counter) Gunther, I want you to give Joey his job back. That is really not fair that you
have to fire him…"
267,Rachel, What?
269,Rachel," That’s right, he can have his job back. I’m glad we got that
all straightened out. There you go, Joey, you got your job back."
270,Joey, That’s great. Thanks Rach.
271,Rachel," Yeah, pretty nice, huh? Now who’s a pushover?"
272,Phoebe," (returning from the bathroom) Rach, you’re in my seat."
273,Rachel," Oh, I’m sorry. (Gets up and moves.)"
276,Phoebe," Hey, I never got to hear who you guys would pick to be your girlfriend."
277,Monica," I pick you, Phoebe."
278,Rachel," Oh, yeah. Definitely you, Pheebs."
279,Phoebe," Yeah, well, I kinda thought."
282,Chandler, Hey.
283,Rachel," Hey. Oh, I have a question. If-if-if one of you had to pick one of the
other two guys to go out with, who would you pick?"
284,Ross, No way. 
285,Joey, I’m not answering that.
286,Chandler," Joey! (Pause as they all stare at him.) No way. I’m not answering
that. "
0,Joey," Okay Rach, that muffin and espresso, $4.50. Ross, double latte, $2.75.
Chandler, coffee and a scone, $4.25. And Pheebs, herbal tea, $1.25. So, all together
that’s (pauses to figure the total) $12.75."
1,Chandler," This coming from the man who couldn’t split our 80 dollar phone
bill in half."
4,Joey, Hi!
6,Joey, Oh that’s on the house courtesy of Joey Tribbiani.
8,Joey," Well, he’s not used to women being so forward with him; but uh, I
good check with him—He says it’s okay. (She hands him her card.) Great! Thanks!
Bye-bye!"
9,Ross," Hey Joey, how come our stuff isn’t free?"
10,Joey," It will be when you look like that in a tight skirt! This is great!
I’m getting more dates than ever!"
11,Rachel," Wait a minute, you’re only giving free stuff away to the pretty
girls?"
12,Phoebe, Yeah Joey that is so gross!
13,Joey, How about a scone on the house baby?
14,Phoebe, (giggles) I’m pretty.
17,Ross, Hey does anyone have any gum?
18,Phoebe," Oh I do! (She grabs her huge purse and starts rummaging through it and
taking out various items in a futile search for the gum.) Oh, y’know what? No.
(Pause) Wait a second. (She removes a bag filled with water that has a goldfish swimming
in it.) I know it’s in here somewhere."
19,Ross, Y’know what? I’m good! I’m good!
20,Monica, (entering) Hey!
21,Ross, Hey!
22,Chandler," Hey, what are you doing here? Shouldn’t you be at work?"
23,Monica," (congested) Ugh, they sent me home. They said I can’t work if
I’m sick."
25,Chandler, I’m so sorry you’re sick.
26,Monica," I’m not sick!! I don’t get sick! Getting sick is for weaklings
and for pansies! "
27,Rachel," Honey, no one thinks you’re a pansy, but we do think you need a
tissue. (She notices something hanging from Monica’s nose, as does Joey.)"
28,Monica, (wiping her nose) I have not been sick in over three years! (Sneezes.) 
29,Chandler, I’m gonna grab you some tissue.
30,Monica, I don’t need a tissue! I’m fine-d! 
31,Ross," When you put a ‘D’ at the end of ‘Fine’ you’re
not fine."
32,Monica," I’m fine-d. I’m fine-d! Y’know, it’s a really hard
word to say."
34,Chandler, Yes?
37,Rachel," Oh my God, Jill!"
40,Chandler," Oh my God, introduce us!"
41,Rachel, This is Chandler. (Points at him.)
43,Rachel, And you know Monica and Ross!
44,Ross, Hi Jill.
45,Rachel," And that’s Phoebe (points), and that’s Joey."
46,Joey," Hey, (in the Joey voice) how you doin’?"
47,Rachel," Don’t!! (Joey backs away frightened.) (To Jill) Honey, what are you
doing here?!"
48,Phoebe," (To Ross) Which-which sister is this? Is this the spoiled one or
that’s bitter?"
50,Phoebe," Never mind, I got it."
52,Rachel, Wow! What did he say?
54,Rachel," Oh! Did you hear that?! My dad’s proud of me! My dad’s proud
of me."
55,Monica, Rach? (Points to Jill.)
56,Rachel," Oh yeah, sorry. Wait honey, so what did you do that made dad cut you
off?"
58,Monica, You bought a boat?
60,Chandler," Boy did we make friends with the wrong sister! (Rachel glares
at him.)"
61,Rachel," Jill, honey, I think this is the best thing that could’ve ever
happened to you. I mean you needed to get out on your own anyway! And you know when I did
it, I-I-I at first I was scared, and look at me now! I’m the only daughter dad is
proud of! Okay, well this is, this is what you’re gonna do. You’re gonna get a
job, you’re gonna get an apartment, and then I’ll help you and you can stay with
us. Right Pheebs, she can stay with us?"
62,Phoebe," Of course, yeah!"
64,Phoebe," Ooh, I like cards."
66,Joey, (to a customer) Are you all finished here?
68,Joey, Great! (Joey takes his cookie and finishes it.)
70,Joey, What?!
72,Joey," Well if it’s free food, how come you’re charging me for it?"
74,Joey," Well, what if they came in third in a modeling contest?"
76,Joey," (to a woman who came in third in a modeling contest) Sorry! (He grabs her
muffin away and returns it to the serving tray.)"
78,Ross," Jill, how did you pay for all this? I thought your dad took away your
credit card."
80,Ross," I don’t think charging new clothes too your dad qualifies as making
it on your own."
82,Phoebe," Seriously, I don’t Rachel’s gonna think it’s a good idea."
84,Phoebe, I would love that job!
85,Rachel, (entering) Hey! What’s goin’ on?
87,Rachel, (notices Jill’s bags) Jill! Did you shop?!
90,Rachel," You went shopping?! What, and then you just came in here and paraded it
right under Jill’s nose when you know she’s trying to quit. Wow, you guys are
terrible!"
91,Phoebe, Sorry Jill.
92,Ross, Sorry-sorry Jill.
93,Rachel, What’d you get?
94,Phoebe," Oh well, all right, I got (Ross hands her a bag) (To Ross) thank you, I
got uh, this y’know ""I want a job sweater."" (Holds up the same sweater.)"
95,Rachel, Oh.
96,Phoebe," And, and then I got uh, these are apartment pants."
97,Rachel, Apartment pants?
98,Phoebe," Yeah, you never heard of them?"
99,Rachel," No, of course, of course I’ve heard of them! Ross, what did you
get?"
100,Ross," Huh? Oh, I got this—(Holds up this pink frilly thing)—this!"
101,Rachel, A pajmena?
102,Ross," Yeah! Oh, I-I love this babies!"
103,Rachel, Really?
104,Ross," Ross, wants a pajmena?"
105,Ross, It’s a rug. (Jill winces.)
106,Rachel, Jill?
108,Rachel," Oh, come on! You think that’s gonna work on me?! I invented that!"
110,Rachel," All right, it’s okay. One little setback is okay, just don’t
let it happen again, all right? Now since daddy paid for all this stuff, I should
take it all away. But I’m just gonna take the-the pajmena. (Ross hands it to her.)
And the uh, and the uh pants. Y’know what, I’m just gonna take it all away,
‘cause that way you’ll just really learn the lesson. Okay? All righty, I’m
gonna run a couple of errands and I will see you at dinner. (Leaves with all of
Jill’s stuff.)"
112,Ross," Yeah. Everything but, the little blue one. (Holds it up for her.)"
114,Ross, Well. Hey…
116,Ross," Oh yeah, how about you and the, (mimics her fake cry) ""I’m
sorry!"""
118,Phoebe," What about, what about when I said y’know about the apartment
pants, how dumb was I?"
121,Ross, Oh stop.
123,Ross," No, you stop!"
125,Phoebe," (gets up and sits between them) Okay-okay, why don’t I sit here and
you’ll both stop it!"
127,Monica," Okay, so what do you, what do you want to do? Let’s do something
crazy!"
128,Chandler," I know, let’s rest and drink lots of fluids. (Holds up a glass of
orange juice.)"
129,Monica," Okay, I’ll rest. But y’know if I’m going to bed, then
you’re coming with me."
130,Chandler," That would be impossible to resist if you weren’t all drippy
here. (Points to his nose.)"
131,Monica," (wiping her nose) Are you saying that you don’t wanna get with
this? (Tries to do a little sexy body rub, but it doesn’t work all that well with the
big robe.)"
132,Chandler," Yeah, I don’t you should say that even when you’re healthy."
133,Monica, (in a sexy voice) Come on. (Coughs loudly.)
134,Chandler," Don’t take this personally okay? It’s just that I just
can’t have sex with a sick person."
135,Monica," I’m with you Chandler! I mean I can’t have sex with a sick
person either, that’s disgusting! But I’m not sick! Let me prove it to you. We
are two healthy people in the pribe of libe."
136,Chandler," That’s the thing, see I would like to stay in the pribe of
mwha-ah-libe."
138,Rachel, Hey!
139,Phoebe, Hey.
140,Rachel, What’s up?!
141,Phoebe," Umm, I think there’s something you should maybe know."
142,Rachel," Well, it’d better not be about the apartment pants, because I just
pitched the idea to my boss at Ralph Lauren and she loved it."
143,Phoebe," No. No. It’s just I was umm, I was with Ross and Jill after you
left and umm, I’m pretty sure I saw a little spark between them."
144,Rachel, What?!
145,Phoebe," Yeah I mean it’s probably nothing, but I just wanted to warn you
that there might be something there."
146,Rachel, With Ross and Jill?
147,Phoebe, Yeah!
148,Rachel, With Ross and my sister?
149,Phoebe, Yeah.
150,Rachel, With my sister Jill and my ex-boyfriend Ross?
151,Phoebe, Yeah.
152,Rachel, Oh there is no way.
153,Phoebe, Okay then.
154,Rachel," Oh my God! I can not believe that! I mean I don’t really like it
when Ross goes out with anyone, but my sister isn’t that like incest or something?!
Oh my God, and they’re gonna have sex! Oh! Oh no what if he marries her too?! Oh this
is just terrible, this is just terrible. And I can’t stop it! I can’t—I
don’t own Ross! Y’know? And Jill, she should be able to do whatever it is that
she wants to do! And oh my God, I can’t believe Ross is marrying my little sister,
this terrible. Oh my God, this is just the worst thing that could have ever happened to
me."
155,Phoebe," But great news about the apartment pants, huh?"
157,Joey, That’ll be $3.85.
159,Joey," It’s just I can’t because my manager said I… (Gets an idea)
(Starts singing) ""Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you. Happy birthday dear
Annie…"
161,Joey," (still singing) ""…Amy! Happy birthday to you!"""
163,Joey," Yeah, not it here it isn’t."
165,Rachel," (on the couch) Oh hi! Y’know, I just wanted to see if there were
any leads on the old job front."
167,Rachel," That is great. Hey, y’know who doesn’t have to job hunt? Ross.
He works at the university. "
169,Rachel," Oh so you know that, you guys talked about that, so you get along, so
you think you’re gonna go out?"
171,Rachel," I just, Phoebe, said y’know thought she saw something between you
guys."
173,Rachel, Yeah.
175,Rachel," Oh not-not so much. Umm, what-what do you, what do you mean is there
something wrong with Ross?"
177,Rachel, Are-are you saying he’s a geek?
179,Rachel," No! No I, no Ross is not a geek!"
181,Rachel," What handsome is not your type? Smart? Kind? Good kisser? What those
things aren’t on your list? Ross is a great guy! You would be lucky to be with him!"
183,Rachel," Oh no-no-no, no-no-no, that’s not what I meant."
185,Rachel," Yeah but, he’s not your type."
187,Rachel," Yeah but, you don’t, you don’t, you don’t want to try to
much too fast. Y’know? I mean, you do remember what happened to the little girl that
tried to much too fast don’t you?"
189,Rachel, She-she died Jill.
192,Monica, (still sick) Chandler!
193,Chandler," Oh what is it honey, you need some tea? Some soup? (He gets up from
the couch and goes into the bedroom to find Monica, still in the robe, lying seductively
on the bed. Or at least she’s trying too and as he enters the room, she takes the
robe off on of her legs.) Oh-ohhhh!"
194,Monica," (trying to be seductive) Calling Dr. Big, Dr. Big to the bed."
195,Chandler," Oh Jeez honey, I thought, I thought you were asleep."
196,Monica, How could I be asleep knowing that you were in the next room.
197,Chandler," I was asleep. (She takes off her robe and starts to shiver) Oh no!
No-no honey! Y’know what’s sexy? Layers. Layers are sexy. And blankets are sexy.
And oh! Hot water bottles are sexy."
198,Monica," Come on, get into bed! I want to prove to you that I’m not sick! I
wanna make you feel, as good as I feel. (Sneezes.) "
199,Chandler, Would you please get some rest!
200,Monica," I’m fine. (She goes into one of those half sneezing, half-coughing
fits that you get with a bad cold or flu.)"
202,Joey," (singing) ""Happy birthday to you!"""
204,Joey, What? No-no it’s her birthday!
206,Joey, But it really…
208,Joey, Damnit! (Storms off.)
209,Ross, (entering) Rach? Hi!
210,Rachel, Hi!
211,Ross, Did you tell your sister to ask me out?
212,Rachel, Well yeah…
213,Ross," Oh wow! I mean, wow! I mean, I-I-I think she’s cute but I-I would
never have thought of going out with her, never!"
214,Rachel, Really?!
215,Ross," Yeah but after you said it was okay, I figured, ""Why not?!"""
216,Rachel, Oh so-so not really never.
217,Ross," I have to say you are a much bigger person than I am. I mean after all
we’ve been through, I just—y’know I wish I had a brother to reciprocate.
Hey, if you ever want to go out with Monica, you have my blessing."
218,Joey," (overhearing them) Oh-ho, and mine!"
220,Monica," (entering) Chandler, I think I’m sick."
221,Chandler, Really? Struck down in the pribe of libe!
222,Monica," Okay, fine I admit it! I feel terrible! Would you please rub this on my
chest? (She hands him some of that Vicks Vap-O-Rub to put on.)"
223,Chandler," No-no-no-no-no-no-no, you are not getting me this way."
224,Monica, Come on! I really need your help!
225,Chandler, No-no-no-no-no!
226,Monica," Fine, I’ll rub it on myself."
227,Chandler, Okay.
229,Chandler," So you’re just, kinda rubbing it on yourself?"
230,Monica, Yeah?
231,Chandler, It’s nice.
232,Monica, Are you kidding me?! Is this; is this turning you on?
233,Chandler, Yes! (Hangs his head in shame.)
234,Monica, I can’t believe it! What is it? Is it the rubbing or the smell?
235,Chandler," It’s all very, very good. (She covers up and sits down.) So you
wanna go uh, mix it up?"
236,Monica," Not now, I’m sick!"
237,Chandler, Oh come on you big faker!
238,Monica, What happened to your rule about never sleeping with sick people?
239,Chandler, Well that was before all the vaporizing action.
240,Monica," Okay, if you really wanna have sex…"
241,Chandler, Okay! (Runs into the bedroom.)
242,Monica, Worked like a charm.
245,Rachel, Hi! Wh-what are you doing here?
247,Rachel," Well, I-I don’t like it."
249,Rachel, It’s kinda slutty.
251,Rachel," Yeah well, I’m-I’m a slut."
253,Ross, (entering) Hi Jill!
255,Ross, Hi (sees Rachel and forgets her name for a moment).
256,Rachel, Rachel.
257,Ross," Rachel! Well, you-you’re not at home,
you’re-you’re-you’re right here."
258,Rachel," Yeah I know, and I bet you thought it would be weird. But it’s not!"
260,Ross," Okay. So well I’ll umm, (To Rachel) I’ll have her home by
midnight."
263,Rachel, Why aren’t you home yet?!
264,Monica, (calling from the bathroom) Is someone there?
265,Rachel," Oh yes, it’s me! Sorry!"
266,Chandler, (calling from the bathroom) What are you doing here?
267,Rachel," Uh, I’m just, I’m just looking out your window. At-at the
view. What are you guys doing?"
268,Chandler, We got some Vap-O-Rub in some places.
270,Rachel," (gasps) Oh, he brought her back to his apartment."
271,Monica," (entering with Chandler) Who? (She looks out the window at Ross’s
apartment) Is that your sister?"
272,Rachel," Ugh, she is a slut!"
273,Monica," God, Ross is on a date with your sister! How weird is that?!"
274,Rachel," Oh my God, look-look he’s taking off her clothes!"
275,Chandler, He’s taking off her coat!
277,Rachel," Oh, this is just terrible. "
278,Monica," Oh no it’s not, no it’s not. It’s a first date. I’m sure
that nothing is gonna…(as she is talking we see Ross close his drapes.)"
279,Rachel, Oh. (Squeaks again.)
280,Chandler," Ho-oh, he’s gonna get some! (Rachel looks at him.) Of the glare
from the streetlight out of his apartment. Y’know so umm, he’s closed the drapes
there so he can have a nice, pleasant conversation with your little sister. (Pause) Well,
I’m off to bed! (Goes to bed.)"
0,Joey," (sees Rachel) Oh, uh, hey Rach. I uh, I was just coming over here to
uh… Oh wait, I don’t have to lie to you, you don’t live here anymore. Uh,
I’m eating their food. What are you doing?"
1,Rachel," Ross is on a date with my sister and they shut the drapes two and
a-half-hours ago."
2,Joey," Whoa, I didn’t know we could date your sister!"
4,Monica, Joey we know you steal our food.
6,Chandler, I’m good.
7,Monica," (To Rachel) Oh, are the drapes still closed hon?"
8,Rachel," Yeah. And y’know who should’ve shut their drapes? Is that
perverted old couple two doors over."
9,Chandler, (looking) Is that a swing?
10,Rachel, Oh don’t even ask!
11,Chandler, Yuck!
12,Joey," I can’t believe Ross went out with Rachel’s sister! When
Chandler made out with my sister I was mad at him for 10 years."
13,Chandler, That was like 5 years ago.
14,Joey, Yeah you got 5 years left!
15,Chandler, Joey…
16,Joey, You wanna make it 6?!
19,Rachel," Oh Ross, hi! Hey, how are ya? There you are!"
20,Ross, Hey!
21,Rachel," (to Gunther) I’ll take a coffee. (To Ross) So how was your big date
last night?"
22,Ross," Uhh, it was okay. Yeah, it was fun."
23,Rachel," Yeah fun? Great! So uh, so did you guys hit it off?"
24,Ross, I guess so.
25,Rachel," So uh, so did anything happen? Because rumor has it you guys shut
the drapes!"
26,Ross," No. No. Nothing happened. I shut the drapes to uh, show her slides of my
favorite fossils."
27,Rachel," Oh, slides. (Laughs.) So really nothing happened."
28,Ross," Something could’ve happened. All right? She-she really dug my slides.
And-and she was definitely giving me the vibe."
29,Rachel," Right. Was it the, ""Please don’t show me another picture of a
trilobite vibe?"""
30,Ross," Anyway, if she, if she wasn’t in to me, why-why would she ask me out
again?"
31,Rachel, She asked-asked you out again?
32,Ross," Yeah-uh-huh. Tomorrow night, Valentine’s Day, the most romantic day
of the year. Who knows what could happen? I might not be shutting my drapes to show her my
slides, if you know what I mean."
33,Rachel," Okay-okay-okay-okay-okay-okay-okay! I got it! I got it! I got it! I
can’t! I can’t! I can’t! I cannot go with you and my sister thing. Okay? I
just can’t. It’s just too weird, all right? I imagine the two of you together
and I freak out. It freaks me out. I can’t do it! I can’t do it."
34,Ross," (while Rachel is finishing her rant) Okay! Okay! Okay! It’s okay.
(Rachel stops.) It’s okay. Hey, it’s too weird for you, I won’t see her
again."
35,Rachel, Thank you. I…yeah.
36,Ross, I mean after tomorrow night.
37,Rachel," No-no-no! No-no-no! Please Ross, I can’t! I can’t do it!
(Starts to freak out.) It’s just gonna freak me out!!!"
38,Ross," Okay! Okay! Ooh-hey-hey-hey! Okay! Okay! Okay! I’ll-I’ll tell
her tonight I can’t see her anymore."
39,Rachel, Ross thanks.
40,Ross, You want me to call her right now?
41,Rachel," Oh no! No! No-no-no-no! No, I mean come on that’s-that’s
crazy—I mean that’s crazy. So what’s-what’s going on with you? What is
going on with you?"
42,Ross," Well umm, oh! I might be teaching another class this semester!"
43,Rachel," Yeah do it now, call right now."
45,Monica, (crying) This is my favorite part.
46,Phoebe, (crying) Yeah me too.
48,Phoebe," Oh y’know what’s sadder than this? Bambi. I cried for
three days with that movie. No wait two! Because on the third day my mother killed herself
so I was partly crying for that."
49,Chandler," (totally not crying) Well see now that I can see crying over, but Bambi
is a cartoon!"
50,Joey, (crying) You didn’t cry when Bambi’s mother died?
51,Chandler, Yes it was very sad when the guy stopped drawing the deer!
52,Monica," Chandler there’s nothing wrong with crying! I mean you don’t
have to be so macho all the time."
53,Chandler, I’m not macho.
54,Monica, Yeah you’re right. I don’t know what I was thinking.
55,Chandler," No, I guess I just never really cried. Y’know? I’m not a
crying kind of guy."
56,Joey," Come on man there’s gotta be something that gets you choked up! Like
uh, uh oh, what if you saw a three-legged puppy?"
57,Chandler," I’d be sad sure, but I wouldn’t cry."
58,Joey," Okay, what if the puppy said, ""Help me Chandler. All the other
puppies pick on me."""
59,Chandler," Cry?! I just found a talking puppy, I’m rich!"
60,Monica," Oh, I’ve got it! I have got it! (Gets up and gets something from
the dresser underneath the TV.) Pictures from your childhood. This will get you going
good!"
62,Phoebe," All right, what’s going on there? (Points to a picture.)"
63,Chandler," Oh, that’s Parent’s Day, first grade. That’s me with
the janitor Martin."
64,Monica, Where were your parents?
65,Chandler, Oh they didn’t want to come!
66,Phoebe, Oh Chandler!
67,Monica, Poor thing!
68,Phoebe, So that story doesn’t make you cry?
69,Chandler," No! Look, I don’t cry! It’s not a big deal! Okay?!"
70,Joey," No! It’s not okay! It’s not okay at all!! You’re dead
inside!!"
73,Phoebe, Yeah?
75,Phoebe, Yeah.
77,Phoebe," Oh you’re my biggest fan? I’ve always wanted to meet you! Hi!
(Shakes his hand.) Sure! Yeah! (Signs the autograph)"
79,Phoebe," You’re just saying that because you’re my biggest fan. (The
fan leaves and Joey approaches.) (To Joey) Joey listen, take good care of that guy, okay?
(Points) He’s a fan. (To the fan as she’s leaving) Bye! (Exits)"
80,Joey," (to the fan) So, you saw me on Days Of Our Lives huh? Want me to,
want me to do a little Dr. Drake Remoray for ya?"
82,Joey," Oh, you’re Phoebe’s fan!"
84,Joey, Movies?
86,Joey, (laughs) I don’t think so.
88,Joey," Hey Gunther, don’t let that guy in here anymore! He just said
Phoebe’s a porn star!"
92,Rachel, Hey!
94,Rachel," Ohhh well. Y’know what honey? The best thing to do to get over a
guy is to start dating someone else. Oh! There is this great guy you will love at work
named Bob! He’s a real up-and-comer in Human Resources."
96,Rachel," It’s not random, it’s Bob."
98,Rachel," No honey, okay, okay, you wanna know why Ross canceled the date? Because
I asked him to."
100,Rachel, Hm-mmm.
102,Rachel, Because you are my sister and Ross and I have this huge history…
104,Rachel, No.
106,Rachel, (changing the subject) Y’know Bob in Human Resources…
108,Rachel," Look, this is not that big of a deal! You just don’t date Ross!
There’s a million other guys out there, you just…"
110,Rachel," I’m not telling you what to do! I am telling you what not to
do!"
112,Rachel," Jill this is not about me being jealous of you! This is about you being
a brat! Wanting what you can’t have!"
114,Rachel," All right, all right, well you just blew your chances at dating Bob!"
116,Rachel, In Human Resources!!!!!!
118,Rachel," …I am jealous of her?! I mean who does she think she is?! Princess
Caroline?!"
119,Monica, You’re jealous of Princess Caroline?
120,Rachel, Do I have my own castle?
122,Ross," Hey! Uh, Phoebe’s not here is she?"
123,Rachel, No.
124,Monica, (noticing the bag Joey’s carrying) Oh great! Did you get a movie?
125,Joey," Uhhh, yeah. Yeah. But uh, I don’t think it’s the kind
you’re gonna like."
126,Chandler," You didn’t get more movies that are gonna have us reaching for
the tissues all night did you?"
128,Joey, Sort of…
129,Monica," Guys, what’s going on?"
130,Joey, (holds up the movie) Phoebe’s a porn star!
133,Chandler, Phoebe Buffay in Buffay The Vampire Layer.
134,Rachel, Oh my God!
135,Monica, That’s Phoebe! Where did you get that?
136,Joey, Well down at the adult video place down on Bleaker.
137,Ross," And-and I, and I saw that Joey was about to go in, so I ran in ahead of
him to-to surprise him and, and then I pretended I didn’t know he was in there. (They
all kinda look at him.)"
138,Rachel," Wow! I mean, I just—I can’t, I can’t believe this.
Y’know, I mean you think you know someone even, even Phoebe who’s always been
somewhat of a question mark."
139,Monica," This is so bizarre. I guess it kinda makes sense though, y’know she
had such a terrible childhood."
140,Chandler," Hey, I had a terrible childhood and I don’t do porn."
141,Monica," Yes, but you are dead inside."
142,Joey," All right well, I’d better take that back."
143,Monica," Wh-what, why?"
144,Joey, We can’t watch that! I mean that’s Phoebe!
145,Monica," Yeah you’re right, we can’t—we shouldn’t watch this."
146,Rachel, Absolutely not.
147,Monica," (hands the tape back to Joey, but doesn’t let him grab it)
Y’know maybe a little bit!"
148,Rachel, Probably just the first half.
149,Joey," No! Hey no! This is wrong you guys! Phoebe’s our friend! Well,
I’m not gonna watch it!"
150,Ross, Yeah! Good for you Joe!
151,Joey, Yeah.
158,Monica, Hold on a second! What is that on her ankle?
159,Chandler, Her ankle is what you’re watching?
160,Rachel," Well it’s hard to tell… (Rachel gets up to get a closer look,
only she’s having some trouble.) Oh God, if she would just stop moving."
161,Chandler, She’s just doing her job!
162,Joey, (sitting at the kitchen table with his back to the TV) You sick bastards!
163,Rachel," Oh, it’s a tattoo! That’s weird, Phoebe doesn’t…
Wait that’s Ursula! That’s not Phoebe that is Ursula!"
165,Joey, Re! Re! Then I can watch that! Rewind it! Rewind it!
166,Phoebe," (entering) Hey! What’s up? (Sees the TV) Oh my God! What am I
doing?!!"
169,Monica, Hey sweetie!
170,Chandler," Hey! (He quickly tries to hide the book by throwing it under the
couch, only the couch has no back and it slides into the kitchen.)"
171,Monica, (picking up the book) Chicken Soup for the Soul? 
172,Chandler, There’s no back to this couch!
173,Monica, Why are you reading this? You hate this kind of stuff.
174,Chandler," Yeah I know, but I figured a shot y’know? Maybe one of those
stories would make me cry and then you wouldn’t think I was y’know, all dead
inside."
175,Monica," Oh that’s so sweet! Look Chandler I don’t care if you
can’t cry, I love you."
176,Chandler, Oh that makes me feel so warm in my hollow tin chest.
177,Monica, Stop it!
178,Chandler," No, I mean, come on, seriously think about it, we get married,
we’re up at the altar and I’m like this. (Makes a bored face.)"
179,Monica," I won’t care, because I know you will be feeling it all in here.
(Points to her heart.)"
180,Chandler, Yeah?
181,Monica," Yeah! And if, and if we have a baby one-day, and the doctor hands it to
you in the delivery room and you don’t cry, so what! And-and-and, and if we take him
to college and come home and see his empty room for the first time, and you got nothing,
it won’t matter to me."
182,Chandler," Okay, well I won’t uh, worry about this anymore then."
183,Monica," And-and-and if I die, from a long illness. And you’re writing out
my eulogy and you open a desk drawer and you find a note from me that says, ""I will
always be with you,"" and you still can’t shed one tiny tear, I know you’ll
be crying a river inside."
184,Chandler," Aww, I love you so…"
185,Monica, What is wrong with you?!!!
186,Chandler, What?!
187,Monica," What?! You can’t shed a tear for your dead wife!! Now, I left you a
note from the beyond!"
188,Chandler, So you didn’t mean any of that?!
189,Monica, No you robot!!
191,Ross," You damn kids! You ring my bell one more time, I swear to… (Opens the
door to find Jill standing there.) Ohh, uh Jill. Umm, that-that’s just a little game
I play with the kids down the hall. Umm, they’ve really taken a liking to me.
(Quickly looks out to see if they’re watching.) Uhh
what’s-what’s-what’s the matter?"
193,Ross," Of course, what happened? (Lets her in.)"
195,Ross," Okay, umm…"
197,Ross, What?
199,Ross, Wow! Really?!
201,Ross," Well, I’d love to! Here, you wait right here and I’ll go get the
projector and my notes!"
203,Ross, Ohh!
206,Rachel, Hey! Have you guys seen Jill? I can’t find her anywhere.
207,Monica," No, I haven’t."
208,Rachel," Well, is Ross home? Maybe I’ll just call him to see if he’s
actually seen her. "
212,Phoebe, It’s Phoebe! Phoebe!
215,Phoebe, (seeing her dress) Oh God. So-so you’re making porn movies.
219,Phoebe, You’re making one right now!
221,Phoebe, And-and you’re using my name!
224,Phoebe," Look, I’m talking right now! You’re—you mean her."
226,Phoebe, What?!
228,Phoebe," No!! No way! No! And stop using my name! And shame on you! (Yells into
the apartment) And shame on all of you! You’re disgusting! Especially you (points to
someone) with that! (Storms away.)"
230,Ross, Slides are almost ready.
232,Ross," Uh okay, well there’s-there’s wine in the kitchen."
234,Ross, (answering it) Hello?
235,Rachel," (on phone) What is my sister doing there?! And why are the
drapes shut?!"
236,Ross," O-okay, Rach calm-calm down, okay? She-she’s really upset we’re
just talking."
237,Rachel," Ross! I think she is trying to make something happen with you to get
back at me!"
238,Ross," So that’s the only reason she could be here huh? It couldn’t
have anything to do with the fact that-that maybe I’m a good listener and I uh I put
on a great slide show!"
239,Rachel," Ross, I am telling you that she is using you to get back at me!"
240,Ross," Y’know what? I think I can take care of myself, I’ll talk to you
later. Good-bye. (Hangs up the phone and turns to find Jill sitting really close to him.)
Whoa! Uh, that was your sister actually. She-she thinks that you’re just using me."
243,Phoebe, Hey!
244,Joey, Hey!
245,Phoebe," So, I just came from the company Ursula works for."
246,Joey," Oh no, not you too!"
247,Phoebe," No! No! I just went to pick up Phoebe Buffay’s checks; there were a
lot of them."
248,Joey, Nice!
249,Phoebe," Um-mmm, and I won’t have to go there anymore because I gave
them my correct address."
250,Joey," That’s great, but isn’t it gonna bother that people still think
you’re a porn star?"
251,Phoebe, Oh no! No! I know how to handle it.
252,Joey, You do?
253,Phoebe," Yeah. (She notices some guy putting a coat on his girlfriend is trying
to remember where he’s seen her before.) (To him) You’re trying to figure out
where you know me from? All right, I’ll give you a hint. From porn! Okay? (He tries
to rush his girlfriend out.) Yeah your pervert boyfriend watched me in a porno movie! (To
Joey) See?"
254,Joey, Yeah.
256,Chandler, Hey.
257,Ross," (To Rachel) You uh, you may have been right about Jill."
258,Rachel, Oh! I knew it! What happened?
259,Ross," Umm, she kissed me."
260,Rachel, What?! You kissed!
261,Chandler, (To Monica) Maybe we should give them some privacy.
262,Monica, (To Chandler) Shhhh!!!
263,Ross," Look, I uh, I tried not to kiss her, okay?"
264,Rachel," Well, it doesn’t sound like it! I mean, it’s pretty easy not
to kiss someone, you just don’t kiss them! See look at us, right now, not kissing!"
265,Ross," Let me finish, okay? She started kissing me and-and I didn’t stop it.
I guess I-I just wasn’t thinking…"
266,Rachel," Yeah that’s right you weren’t thinking! Y’know what? Let
me give you something to think about! (She pulls up her sleeves and steps towards him.)"
267,Ross," Oh wait—hold it! But then I started thinking and I stopped the
kissing."
268,Rachel," Oh, well thank you for taking your tongue out of my sister’s mouth
long enough to tell me that."
269,Ross," Look I-I realize if anything were to happen with me and Jill then nothing
could ever happen with us!"
270,Rachel, What?!
271,Ross," No, I mean, look I don’t know if anything is going to happen with us,
again. Ever. But I don’t want to know that it-it never could. So I stopped it and she
got mad and broke my projector."
272,Rachel," Wow. I, I don’t even know what to say. Thank you. (Gently kicks
him.)"
273,Ross, You’re welcome. (Gently kicks her back.)
275,Monica, Oh my God! Are-are you crying?
276,Chandler," (crying hysterically) I just don’t see why those two can’t
work things out!"
280,Rachel," Yeah, I got that."
282,Ross, You take care Jill.
284,Rachel, Bye-bye-e!
285,Monica, Bye.
286,Chandler," (starts crying) I-I can’t believe Jill’s gone. (They all
look at him.) I can’t help it, I opened a gate."
0,Ross," Hey, remember when I had a monkey?"
1,Chandler, Yeah.
2,Ross," Yeah, what, what was I thinking?"
3,Joey," (he’s just picked up their bill) Hey! So, what’s with the 20
percent tip? Did I do something wrong?"
4,Chandler, Twenty percent is a pretty generous tip Joe.
5,Joey," Y’know what’s more generous than that?! Fifty percent!
Y’know what’s even more generous than that?!!"
6,Chandler, I see where you’re goin’!
7,Ross, What’s up with the greed Joe?
8,Joey," All right, look I’m sorry you guys, but it’s just that I gotta
get these new head shots made. And they’re really expensive, y’know? I’m
down to like three! Well, actually two ‘cause one of ‘em I kinda blackened in
some teeth—Why did I do that?! (Hits himself in the head.)"
9,Ross," Well isn’t there something you can do to earn a little extra money? I
mean, can’t-can’t you pick up, I don’t know, an extra shift here?"
10,Phoebe," Or, y’know, I used to beg for money. Of course it helps if
you’ve got y’know a little of this (she sticks her chest out and shakes it)
goin’ on. Wow! I still have it!"
11,Ross," Oh, wait! Wait! Don’t you have an audition today? Yeah! Maybe
you’ll get that job!"
12,Joey," Oh, ha-ha-ha! Ooh! Wait a minute, I used to get medical experiments down
on me all the time!"
13,Chandler," (reminiscing) Ah, finally an explanation."
14,Joey," No-no! I used to get paid for all kinds of medical stuff, remember?
Let’s see uh, well I don’t want to donate sperm again. (To Ross) I really prefer
doing that at the home office y’know? (Ross nods his head.) Ooh-ooh, maybe they want
like some of my blood or-or spit or something, huh?"
16,Joey, Yeah?
18,Joey, Uhh do it?
20,Joey," Well, where was I? (Takes a sip of the coffee.)"
23,Ross, Hi!
24,Phoebe, Hey!
25,Ross," Hey, what have you guys been up to?"
26,Phoebe, Ohh! We went to a self-defense class today!
27,Ross, Wow!
28,Rachel," Yeah, kicking a guy in the crotch all morning really takes it out of ya!"
29,Joey, Takes it out of you? (Laughs.)
30,Phoebe," Now, we can kick anybody’s ass!"
31,Rachel, Yeah!
32,Ross, After one class? I don’t think so.
33,Rachel," What? You wanna see me self-defend myself?! Go over there (points) and
pretend you’re a sexual predator! Go on! I dare ya!!"
34,Ross," Well, of course you can defend yourself from an attack you know is coming,
that’s not enough. Look, I studying kara-tay for a long time, and there’s a
concept you should really be familiar with. It’s what the Japanese call (he holds two
fingers up to his temple, and he does this every time he says this word) unagi."
35,Rachel, Isn’t that a kind of sushi?
36,Ross," No, it’s a concept!"
37,Phoebe, Yeah it is! It is! It’s freshwater eel!
38,Ross," All right, maybe it means that too…"
39,Rachel, Ohh! I would kill for a salmon skin roll right now!
40,Ross, Y’know what? Fine! Get attacked! I don’t even care! 
41,Phoebe, (deadpan) Come on Ross. We’re sorry. Please tell us what it is.
42,Ross," Unagi is a state of total awareness. Okay? Only by achieving true unagi
can you be prepared for any danger that may befall you!"
43,Phoebe," You mean in case someone is trying to steal your bamboo sleeping mat or
your kettle of fish?"
45,Ross," (moves closer) All I’m saying is, it’s one thing being prepared
for an attack against like each other; whole another story being prepared for an attack, I
don’t know, like a (turns and puts his face close to Rachel’s and screams) surprise!!"
47,Ross," All right, you know that one was coming, but that doesn’t mean you
have unagi. (Does the finger thing.)"
48,Rachel," (To Phoebe) Ooh! Y’know what? If we made reservations, we could
have unagi in about a half-hour."
49,Ross," Y’know what… (Moves away as Chandler enters, panicked.)"
50,Chandler," Hey-hey, is Monica here?"
51,Phoebe, No.
52,Ross, No.
53,Chandler," Okay, look I need your help, I don’t know what to get her for
Valentine’s Day."
54,Rachel," Well, Valentine’s Day was like two weeks ago, so I wouldn’t
get her a calendar!"
55,Chandler," (laughs) She was working on Valentine’s Day so we’re
celebrating it tonight."
56,Joey," Ohh, hey! Why don’t you book a date for both of you at one of those
romantic spas?"
57,Phoebe," Ooh, Joey, that’s actually a really good idea!"
58,Joey," And of course, crotchless panties. "
59,Chandler," Well appealing as that does sound to her boyfriend (pause) and her
brother, (the camera pans to Ross flashing Joey a very evil look; Joey gets scared) I
can’t do that we promised we’d make each other gifts this year."
60,Rachel," Aw, I love that."
61,Phoebe, You guys!
62,Joey," You can’t make crotchless panties? You take, you take a pair of
scissors and you just cut…"
63,Rachel," (interrupting him) Okay-okay-okay! So, making things. That sounds like
so much fun."
64,Chandler," Yeah, I thought so to until I paper mached one of my eyes shut."
65,Phoebe," Oh, I love paper mache! What did you make?"
66,Chandler, I made a… (Does one of those gibberish words.)
67,Phoebe, What is that?
68,Chandler, Nothing!
69,Ross, So what are you gonna do?
70,Chandler," Well, have you guys made anything that maybe I can take credit for?"
71,Phoebe," Ohh! I have! I have! I started making these little sock bunnies! (She
takes out a sock that’s been made into a bunny with eyes, nose, mouth, whiskers, and
two other socks sown onto it for ears.) Oh for crying out loud!"
72,Rachel," Hey, wait a minute! That is my sock!"
73,Phoebe," Now, it’s you little bunny friend. (She sticks it in Rachel’s
face and they both laugh.)"
75,Chandler," (admiring his work) This, this actually is a… (Does the same
gibberish word from before.)"
76,Monica, (entering) Hey!
77,Chandler," Hey! Honey, can I ask you a question about the Valentine’s Day
gifts?"
78,Monica," Oh, yeah."
79,Chandler, Do we have to make the entire thing?
80,Monica," Yes! Why, did you—you forget to make yours?"
81,Chandler," Of course, of course not. I just have to uh, go over to the place
where I-I made it and pick-pick it up."
82,Monica," Okay. (They kiss.) Okay, I can’t wait! This is going to be the best
Valentine’s Day ever! (Chandler giggles and exits.) I can’t believe it! Make the
presents! Make the presents!"
83,Chandler, (sticking his head back in) What?
84,Monica," I’m just so excited to make the presents! (Chandler does another
sarcastic/scared laugh and leaves.) Shoot!"
86,Joey," (to the receptionist) Hi uh, I’m Joey Tribbiani and with all do
respect I’d like to donate some fluids."
88,Joey," Oh that’s too bad. I’ve kinda been saving up. (She just looks at
him in horror.) Uh, are you sure there’s no studies I can participate in?"
90,Joey," Thanks. (Starts to read it.) Well but this one starts now. (Points to
one.)"
92,Joey," But it’s $2,000."
94,Joey," Well how about this one? Testing the effects of Joey Tribbiani on
attractive nurse receptionists."
97,Ross, DANGER!!! DANGER!!!!!
99,Phoebe, Ross!!!
100,Rachel, What the hell was that?!
101,Ross," A lesson in the importance of unagi. (He starts doing the finger thing
every time now.)"
102,Phoebe," Ohh, you’re a freak!!"
103,Ross," Perhaps. Now I’m curious, at what point during those girlish screams
would you have begun to kick my ass?"
104,Rachel," All right, so we weren’t prepared!"
105,Ross," I’m sorry I had to take such drastic measures to make my point, but
I—look, I just want you guys to be safe. (Monica comes out to throw out the garbage
and Ross screams…) DANGER!!!!! (She completely ignores him and keeps walking.)
Ahhh, huh? Unagi."
107,Joey," (in his head) 2,000 bucks is a lot of money. Oh, I wish I had a twin.
Where could I find someone who looks exactly like me? (The camera widens its shot to
reveal a room full of Joey look-a-likes. Joey looks at the guy next to him and then back
at his script.)"
109,Chandler, Hey.
110,Ross, (not turning around) Chandler. I sensed it was you.
111,Chandler, What?!
112,Ross, Unagi. I’m always aware.
113,Chandler," Okay, are you aware unagi (does the finger thing) is an eel?"
114,Ross, What’s up?
115,Chandler, I can’t figure out what to make Monica.
116,Ross," Oh, why don’t you make her one of your little jokes."
117,Chandler," I’m going crazy! Okay? Do you have any thing around here that
looks homemade?"
118,Ross," Y’know what? She’d-she’d love this. (Picks up a model of
the Saturn V rocket, that’s the one that took man to the moon.) Uh, it’s an
exact replica of Apollo 8. I made it in the sixth grade."
119,Chandler," Yeah, I guess I could use that. I could say that your love sends me to
the moon."
120,Ross," Yeah-yeah, except Apollo 8 didn’t actually land on the moon. But
you-you-you could write that umm, your love lets me orbit the moon twice and return
safely. (Apollo 8 was the first one that orbited the moon and the one that read the
Christmas Story from the orbit of the moon on Christmas Eve, 1968. They also took the
famous Earthrise picture of the Earth rising over the moon.)"
121,Chandler," Wait a minute, I can’t give this to her."
122,Ross, Why not?
123,Chandler," Because it says ""Captain Ross"" on the side and ""I hate
Monica"" on the bottom."
124,Ross, Oh.
128,Rachel," Ahhhhh, salmon skin roll. (She does the finger thing.)"
130,Chandler," Okay. Okay. (He goes to the closet, moves the clothes out of the way,
and notices an empty hanger. He takes the empty hanger and bends it all out of shape. Then
he holds it out as if he’s giving it to her.) Yes honey, I made it myself. (He throws
it down and goes to her chest, grabs something, goes to the bed table, and takes out a
pair of scissors. He turns around and holds the scissors to the crotch of the panties he
just removed.) I can’t do it. I can’t do it. (He throws them both down and
continues looking. He opens another closet door and finds a tape.) Oh! Oh! A mixed tape! A
mixed tape!! (He runs out into the living room.)"
132,Chandler," Hey! Hi! You uh, ready to exchange gifts?"
133,Monica," Sure! Okay, you go first."
134,Chandler," Okay, come here! Come here."
135,Monica," Okay! (She takes her present for him and they move over to sit on the
couch.)"
136,Chandler," Now, it’s not wrapped because I just, just finished it."
137,Monica, Okay.
138,Chandler, But I made you a tape of what I think are all romantic songs.
139,Monica," Oh, what a great gift! Is The Way You Look Tonight on it?!"
140,Chandler, (momentarily terrified) Maybe we’ll have to listen and see!
141,Monica," Oh, I love it! Thank you so much!"
142,Chandler, Okay!
143,Monica," Okay, you ready to open yours?"
144,Chandler, Yeah!
145,Monica, Okay.
147,Chandler, It’s a sock bunny.
148,Monica," Yeah-yeah, you remember how I call you bunny?"
149,Chandler, Not really.
150,Monica," Well, I did one time, and-and I want to start doing it more. See
that’s what this is about."
151,Chandler," I see. Y’know umm, Phoebe makes sock bunnies."
152,Monica," No! No, she doesn’t. Uh Phoebe, what she makes—that’s
uh—they’re sock rabbits. They are completely different—Okay! Okay! Okay! I
didn’t make it! I’m sorry! I totally forgot about tonight and the fact that
we’re supposed to make the presents!"
153,Chandler," Oh, it’s okay. I don’t…"
154,Monica," No-no, it’s not okay! It’s not! I mean you were just…
You’re so incredible! You went through all this time and effort to make this tape for
me! Y’know I’m just gonna—I, I am gonna make this up to you! I will! I-I am
going to cook anything you want in here (points to the kitchen), and I am going to do
anything you want in there! (Points to the bedroom.)"
155,Chandler," (thinking it over) Well, I did put a lot of thought in the tape. (They
both run into the bedroom.)"
158,Chandler," Wow! (To the sock bunny still on his hand.) You are way to
young to have seen that!"
159,Monica," Oops! (Covers its eyes.) Y’know, your birthday is in a
month-and-a-half, what do you say I forget to get you a present for that too?"
160,Chandler, You are totally and completely 100% forgiven.
161,Monica, We have got to wash that! (Referring to the sock bunny.)
162,Chandler, Yeah! (Takes it off his hand and throws it behind the night-stand.)
163,Monica," Do you remember that jacket that you love so much, that you thought was
too expensive?"
164,Chandler, You have done enough!
165,Monica, I wanna wake up early and go get it for you!
166,Chandler," No you don’t—get it in black, not brown."
168,Monica," Oop, your cake is ready!"
169,Chandler, Oop!
171,Chandler," Well, it’s like that old saying, have some sex, eat some cake."
174,Monica, Who the hell are you?!
176,Joey," (entering) No! No! No! No! No! How you doin’?! How you
doin’—Damnit Carl! Go wait in the hall! (Goes into the hall.)"
177,Joey," Look, I got to apologize on the behalf of Carl."
178,Chandler, Who the hell is Carl?!
179,Joey," Oh, did I not mention? Carl is a guy I hired to be my identical twin for a
medical research project."
180,Chandler," Y’know sometimes the good ideas are just right in front of you,
aren’t they?"
181,Joey," Okay, I know it sounds crazy, but I think it might work. Y’know? The
only problem is, Carl’s acting is… (Does the international hand symbol for
so-so.)"
182,Monica, The only problem!
183,Joey," Yeah, he’s the reason I didn’t get that big Minute Maid
commercial a couple of years ago remember? We were supposed to be brothers, but he messed
it up."
185,Joey, (to Carl) Pizza!! We like Pizza!! Get out!!! (Carl does so.)
187,Phoebe, Pat Sajak?
188,Rachel, Yep!
189,Phoebe, Alex Trebek?
190,Rachel," Oh, of course!"
191,Phoebe, Chuck Woolery?
192,Rachel," Definitely! Phoebe, you will not find a single game show host,
who’s ass I cannot kick."
195,Rachel, Say it!
196,Phoebe, Say we are unagi!
197,Ross, It’s not something you are! It’s something you have!
198,Rachel, Say it!
199,Ross," Y’know what? I can easily get out of this, but there is a chance you
can get very, very hurt!"
202,Joey," All right Carl, we’re next. Now remember, what is not gonna be?"
204,Joey, That’s right! And what are you not gonna do?
206,Joey," (gets very angry) Damnit Carl! (Carl goes to say something more, and Joey
silences him with a grunt.)"
208,Joey, That’s us.
210,Joey," That’s right, $2,000."
212,Joey, Damnit Carl!
214,Chandler, Oh my good God.
215,Monica," Hey! Continuing the countdown of your favorite meals. Tonight, No. 3,
macaroni and cheese with cut up hot dogs."
216,Chandler," Look, you have done enough! Okay? You have to stop this now."
217,Monica," I will! But not tonight. For dinner music, I thought we could listen to
that tape you made me."
218,Chandler," Oh, the mixed tape."
220,Monica, The Way You Look Tonight is on here! Dance with me?
222,Monica, You are just the sweetest. (They kiss.)
225,Chandler," No! You’re the sweetest! (He tries to kiss her but Monica backs
away with a look that could kill on her face.)"
229,Ross, It’s a great class.
231,Ross," Yeah, yeah, I was watching. (The instructor just nods and walks away.)
Umm, hey, a couple of questions though. Umm, about that-that-that last move where the
woman tripped you and then pinned you to the floor, what-what-what-what would you do next?"
233,Ross, No. No-no. No. What would you do next?
235,Ross, Yes that’s right.
237,Ross," I tired attacking two women, did not work."
239,Ross," No, I mean it’s okay, I mean, they’re-they’re my friends.
In fact, I-I-I was married to one of them."
241,Ross," Oh, no! No-no! No, I tired! But I couldn’t. That’s why I’m
here. Maybe we could attack them together? (He glares at him.) That-that’s a no."
243,Chandler," I am so, so, so, so sorry!"
244,Monica, (not buying it) Uh-huh.
245,Chandler," And I will cook anything you want in here (points to the kitchen), and
do anything in there! (Points to the bedroom.)"
246,Monica," (pointing to the kitchen) Yeah you will! (Points to the bedroom) And,
are you kiddin’ me?!"
247,Chandler," Come on Monica, it’s our Valentine’s Day. Please?
Please-please, please?"
248,Monica, Okay.
249,Chandler, Okay. (They hug.)
252,Chandler," So, are we going in there?"
253,Monica, I am!! (Enter her room and closes the door behind her.)
257,Ross," Ah-ha, nowhere to run! (He starts to run towards them.)"
259,Rachel," I don’t like sitting up here! I’m just gonna over… (She
starts to get up.)"
260,Phoebe, (stopping her) No Rachel! They got here first!
262,Phoebe, Why is Ross doing that?
263,Ross, DANGER!!!!
264,Rachel, Oh my God! Why is he jumping on those women!
265,Phoebe, We should help him!
266,Rachel," I… Well, I don’t think they need any help."
0,Ross," Hey! I just got uh, my teacher evaluations! Check out what this one
student wrote, ""I loved Dr. Geller’s class. Mind blowing lectures! Dr. Geller,
you are definitely the hottie of the paleontology department!"""
1,Chandler," Ahh, Hotties of the Paleontology Department, there’s a big
selling calendar, eh?"
2,Rachel, Who wrote it?
3,Ross," Oh, I wish I knew, but the evaluations are all anonymous."
4,Joey," Oh hey, do you still have their final exams?"
5,Ross, Yeah.
6,Joey," Oh, ‘cause you can just match the evaluation to the exam with the
same handwriting and boom, there’s your admirer. (Ross is stunned.)"
7,Chandler, A hot girl’s at stake and all of the sudden he’s Rain Man.
8,Rachel," Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, why are we so sure that this is a
girl?"
9,Ross," It’s a girl! Anyway, it wou—it wouldn’t matter. Okay?
Because I’m a teacher and she’s a student."
10,Chandler," Oh, is that against the rules?"
11,Ross," No, but it is frowned upon."
12,Chandler, I see.
13,Ross," Besides, there’s a big age difference."
14,Joey," Oh, well think of it like this, when you’re 90…"
15,Ross," I know when I’m 90 she’ll be like 80 and it won’t seem like
such a big difference."
16,Joey," No that’s not what I was going to say at all. No, what I was going to
say is when you’re 90 you’ll still have the memory of what it was like to be
with a 20-year-old."
19,Joey," Hey Chandler! Y’know that girl you went to college with who-who
became a movie director?"
20,Chandler," Oh yeah, Dana Keystone. She was in my Movement class."
21,Phoebe, What’s a Movement class?
22,Monica, It’s Chandler’s way of pretending he didn’t take mime.
23,Joey," Oh well listen, anyway she’s directing the new Al Pacino movie. You
gotta get me an audition!"
24,Chandler," Oh, I don’t know man. I haven’t talked to her in like ten
years."
25,Joey," No-no-no, please-please Chandler I-I-I would owe you so much!"
26,Chandler," You do owe me so much. You owe me three thousand, four
hundred…"
27,Joey," Hey-hey dude, why are you changing the subject? Why? Will you make the
call or what?"
28,Chandler," Oh okay, I’ll-I’ll try."
29,Joey," All right! Thanks! You’re the best! Now listen, the last day of
auditions is Thursday. Okay? So I gotta get in there by Thursday. Okay? Just remember
Thursday. Thursday. Can you remember Thursday?"
30,Chandler," Yeah so, Tuesday?"
31,Joey," (angrily) Thursday! Look if you need help remembering think of like this,
the third day. All right? Monday, one day. Tuesday, two day. Wednesday, when? Huh? What
day? Thursday! The third day! Okay?!"
32,Chandler, (sarcastically) Thank you.
33,Joey, Okay.
34,Rachel, (entering from the bathroom) Hey Mon? I’m gonna check my messages.
35,Chandler, You just thought of that in there?
36,Monica," Yeah sure, nature called, she wanted to see who else did."
38,Rachel," (on phone) Hello? (Shocked that someone answered.) Uh, Rachel. (To the
gang.) Great, someone is in our apartment. Call the cops!"
39,Monica, You’re on the phone!
40,Rachel," (on phone) Oh my God! Oh my God! Thank you! (Hangs up) That was the fire
department, there was a fire at our place!"
41,Phoebe, Oh my God! How bad was it?
42,Rachel," Well, he didn’t say, but it was a fire. I’m guessing not very
good. Come on, we gotta go!"
43,Monica, Come on! (The girls all run out and Joey holds up Chandler by smiling.)
44,Chandler, What are you smiling about? What is so funny?
45,Joey," The part I want to audition for is a fireman, this is so meant to be!"
49,Ross, (startled) Yeah?
51,Ross," Oh thank you. Thanks very much. (Leans up against the board and on a
thumbtack.) Ow! (He pulls away.)"
53,Ross, That was you?
55,Ross," Oh I, I don’t-I don’t think that would be the best idea."
57,Ross, What time?
59,Ross, Gotcha. (Starts to leave.)
61,Ross," Oh! So-so seriously, what time?"
63,Phoebe," Coming through! (Has to dodge a fireman) Oh! Coming through! (Sees a
cute one.) Oh! Hello! Hi! (Smiles then realizes) No! Right! Coming through! "
65,Monica," Oh well, it’s not so bad. "
67,Phoebe, Oh!
68,Rachel, My God! (They both run into the bedrooms.)
69,Joey," (to the fireman) Hey buddy, do you think I can borrow your uniform this
Thursday?"
71,Monica," Joey! He’s working! (To Chandler) You would look good in
that."
73,Joey," Oh, how bad is it?"
74,Phoebe," Oh, it’s bad. It’s really bad. The only thing in there that
isn’t burned is an ass. Which I do not remember buying!"
75,Chandler, How’s your room Rach?
76,Rachel," Everything’s ruined. My bed. My clothes. Look at my favorite blue
sweater. (Hold it up.)"
77,Monica, Isn’t that mine?
78,Rachel, Fine! I’m sorry for your loss! (Hands it back to her.)
80,Rachel," (stands up) Wow! Oh-okay, look pal, I am not in the mood to be
hit on right now! But if you give me your number I will call you some other time."
81,Monica," (pulling Rachel back down) Yes, they can stay with us."
82,Chandler, Have you figured out what started the fire Mr. Fireman?
84,Phoebe," No, not usually. But yeah, I could use one right now."
86,Phoebe," Yes! I do! All the time! I love them! Oh my God! I did it! It’s me!
It’s me! I burned down the house! I burned down the house!"
87,Rachel," Okay Phoebe calm down, there’s no need to place blame. Okay? (To
the fireman) I warned her about those candles."
89,Chandler," God, it’s great to catch up! I can’t believe how long
it’s been!"
90,Joey," Chandler, is that… (Mimes someone using a movie camera and Chandler
nods yes.)"
91,Chandler, (on phone) Oh that’s great! Good for you.
92,Joey, Hey-hey listen… (Chandler waves him away.)
93,Chandler," Okay! So yeah, maybe we can get together umm… (Joey mimes
throwing something in the air, catching it, rolling it out, putting it in an oven and
cutting it.) Can you hold for one second please? (To Joey) What?!"
94,Joey," When you’re off the phone, do you wanna get a pizza?"
95,Chandler," (on phone) Hi! I’m back. (Goes to hang up the phone.) Yeah, that
sounds great. (Listens) Okay. Well, we’ll do it then. (Listens) Okay, bye-bye. (He
hangs up the phone and turns around to see Joey standing close to him and screams.)"
96,Joey," Hey listen, so when’s-when’s my audition? I mean I know
it’s Thursday, but what time?"
98,Chandler, Hi.
99,Monica, Hey!
100,Chandler," (To Joey) We didn’t get to the audition. I’m gonna take her
to coffee and then we’ll do it then."
101,Joey, Ah-ha!
102,Monica," Wow! So, now you’re going on a date with this girl?"
103,Chandler," Honey, it is not a date! I haven’t talked to her in ten years!
You can’t just call up somebody you haven’t talked to in ten years and ask them
for a favor. There are rules, y’know? You gotta, you got to put in some time."
104,Monica," You’re right, I’m sorry. It’s not like you’re
y’know, going out with an ex-girlfriend."
105,Chandler," No, we only went out once."
106,Monica, You dated her!
107,Chandler, Not once!
108,Monica," All right, well why don’t I go out with an ex-boyfriend and do Joey
a favor?!"
109,Joey," Hey, you wanna do Joey a favor, maybe you go out with Joey. (He turns
around to see Chandler glaring at him.)"
111,Chandler," (laughs) Oh that’s great, my friend Joey’s in the movie
business."
113,Chandler, (giggles) My friend’s name is Joey.
115,Chandler," Yeah, I’ve always hated that Howie."
117,Chandler, The nerve huh?
119,Chandler, Refill?
121,Monica," Now, this is last minute so I want to apologize for the mess. Okay?"
123,Rachel, Oh my God! It sure didn’t look this way when I lived here.
124,Monica," I know! Now look, there’s only one problem though. There’s
only room for one, so I guess one of you will have to stay at Joey’s."
125,Phoebe," Well, since the fire was kinda my fault I guess (To Rachel) you should
get to stay here."
126,Rachel," Hey! Hey-hey, now this was no one’s fault Pheebs. Okay? It was an
accident."
127,Phoebe," Well no, it was my fault so you should get the nice room."
128,Rachel, Okay! (She jumps on the bed.)
129,Monica," So Rach! You’re the first guest at Hotel Monica! Umm, you’ll
just have to tell me how you like your eggs in the morning. And I thought I would bring
them to you, y’know, in bed. Oh, you have been through so much."
130,Rachel, I have.
132,Joey," This right here is where I keep the pizza. (He points to the chair.) And
uh that’s where the napkin is. (Points to the floor next to the chair.)"
133,Phoebe, What’s that smell?
134,Joey, I know! (Shrugs his shoulders.)
137,Ross," What? Of course I did! You uh, you sat next to Sleepy Sleeperson."
139,Ross," Oh uh, I had trouble remembering everyone’s name, so I-I kinda came
up with nicknames. Like the guy on the other side of you was Smelly von Brownshirt."
141,Ross," Umm, no. No."
143,Ross," Umm, it’s Cutie McPretty."
145,Ross," Listen, I gotta tell ya, I-I’m having a great time! Y’know how
before you said it might be weird, the whole student teacher thing, and to be frank I
thought it would be too, but it’s not. I mean it’s not at all."
147,Ross, (pushing Elizabeth into a doorway) Burt!
149,Phoebe, So did you sleep well last night?
150,Rachel, I did. 
151,Phoebe, Yeah?
152,Rachel," I did, Monica was so sweet she left a little mint on my pillow."
153,Phoebe, Y’know what Joey left on my pillow?
154,Rachel, What?
155,Phoebe, Gum!
157,Phoebe," Yeah I know, it was my candle. My candle!"
159,Phoebe, I don’t use a curling iron.
162,Rachel," Well, don’t look at me! My hair’s straight! Straight!
Straight! Straight!"
164,Rachel, Oh.
166,Joey," This is where I keep the pizza. (It’s the same location as before.)
And—Hey! Where did the napkin go?! (The napkin is not in it’s spot.)"
169,Monica, Now there you go! I wouldn’t want my best guest to strain her eyes!
170,Phoebe, Thanks Monica!
171,Monica, Does that smell bother you?
172,Phoebe," What the smell from Joey’s? No, I can hardly smell it over here."
173,Monica," Well you let me know if you can, because y’know I can bake a pie to
cover it."
174,Phoebe," I can smell it a little, bake the pie."
175,Monica, Okay!
176,Phoebe, Okay.
178,Monica," Hello? (Listens) Oh yes, one minute please. (To Phoebe) It’s for
you. It’s the fire inspector."
179,Phoebe," Oh! (Takes the phone.) Hello? (Listens) Yeah this is Phoebe. (Listens)
Really?!"
181,Joey," (in a funny voice) Yeah, so it turns out that it wasn’t the hair
straightener that started the fire. (Rachel prompts him on what to say next.) No-no, it
was the candles. It’s very not good leaving candles unattended. In fact, one of the
first things they teach you in fire school is… (Phoebe suddenly enters.) Uhh…
Uhh… Okay. Well, I have to go now. (Phoebe leaves.)"
183,Ross," We had such a great time! She’s-she’s incredible! I thought
the-the age difference might be a problem, but it wasn’t. It wasn’t at all.
Elizabeth is very mature for her age. (Joey makes the international sign for big boobies.)
(To Monica) A concept lost on some people!"
184,Monica, So it’s okay to date a student.
185,Ross," Well, not really. I mean technically it’s-it’s not against the
rules or anything, but it is frowned upon. Especially by that professor we ran into last
night, Judgey von Holierthanthou."
186,Monica," Well Ross, you be careful now. You don’t want to get a reputation
as y’know Professor McNailshisstudents. "
187,Ross, Yeah. What-what should I do?
188,Joey," Well Ross, it seems pretty clear. I mean what’s more important? What
people think or how you feel, huh? Ross, you gotta follow your heart."
189,Monica, Joey that is so sweet.
191,Chandler, (entering) Hey.
192,Joey," Hey-hey-hey! So, how did it go with Dana? Any reason I should leave a
block of time open say Thursday?"
193,Chandler, I couldn’t do it.
194,Joey, You couldn’t do it?!
195,Chandler," Hey, relax I just need more time. We’re going to dinner tonight."
196,Monica, What?! You’re going out with her again!
197,Ross, Going out with who?
198,Chandler," Uh, Dana Keystone from college."
199,Ross," Oh yeah! Wasn’t she uh… (Does the international sign for big
boobies.)"
200,Chandler," No, that was Dana Caplin."
202,Monica, Joey! You didn’t even know her!
203,Joey, Ah whatever!
205,Chandler, Great story again! The yarns that you weave! Woo-hoo-hoo!
207,Chandler," Oh no-no-no! Stay! Stay! Because you-you should you-you-you should
stay!"
209,Chandler," Oh no-no-no, that’s not—No-no-no!"
211,Chandler, No-no—Really?!
213,Chandler," (breaking up) Well, it just hurts so bad. I uh…"
215,Chandler, Well maybe there is one thing you can do.
217,Chandler," Well, I umm, I mean this is just off the top of my head now, umm but I
have this friend. This actor friend and he would kill me if he thought I was doing this
umm, but umm would it be possible for him to get an audition for your movie say on
Thursday?"
219,Chandler," Well, the heart wants what it wants. I’ll see you later. (He runs
off and leaves her with the bill, which the waiter promptly delivers.)"
221,Monica, Hey! How’s it goin’?
222,Phoebe," Well, not much has changed in the last five minutes."
223,Monica, Yes it has! I made cookies!
224,Phoebe," Oh that’s all right. I’m still full from your homemade potato
chips."
225,Monica, But you should eat them now because they’re hot from the oven.
226,Phoebe, Okay. (Reaches for one.)
227,Monica," (pulling the plate back) Oh-ho! But not in here! Can’t eat ‘em
in bed, remember? No crumbies!"
228,Phoebe," (gritting her teeth) Okay, I’ll be out in a second."
229,Monica, Okay!
231,Monica, (opening the door) What are you doing?
232,Phoebe, That doesn’t lock does it?
234,Rachel," Oh, Joey! Sorry!"
235,Joey, No that’s all right. Don’t worry about it.
236,Rachel, Oh but look! That’s gonna leave a stain! 
237,Joey, Rach! Hey! It’s fine! You’re at Joey’s!
238,Rachel, Really?
239,Joey, Yeah! Look! (He throws some of his spaghetti on the floor.)
240,Rachel, I’ve never lived like this before.
241,Joey, I know.
243,Joey," All right, don’t waste it, I mean its still food. (He picks it up and
eats it.)"
245,Ross, What do you want to do now? Huh? You wanna go get a drink?
247,Ross," Oh, you have some studying to do?"
249,Ross," Y’know I remember when uh, when I was in college, we used to…
(He sees some of his colleagues enter and puts his head on her lap.)"
251,Ross," Nothing, I’m-I’m just, I’m so comfortable with you!"
253,Ross," What? No! Of course, of course I do! Are-are they gone?"
255,Ross," What?! No! No! Wait! You’re right, this is stupid. Who cares what
people think? I mean, I mean we like each other right? There’s nothing wrong with
that. Come on. (They get up and go over to the table where his colleagues are sitting.)
Burt? Lydia? Mel? This is Elizabeth."
258,Ross," That’s right Lydia, Elizabeth here is a student and uh, we’re
dating. And you may frown upon that, but we’re not gonna hide it anymore."
260,Ross, What?
262,Ross, Really? Its not just frowned upon?
264,Rachel, I love it at Joey’s!
265,Joey," Hey, here you go. (Hands her another one.)"
266,Chandler," (entering, sees Rachel’s throw) Ni-hi-ice! "
267,Rachel, Thanks!
268,Chandler," (To Joey) So, you busy Thursday?"
269,Joey," Oh, very funny. I don’t know if you remember, but my audition was
supposed to be Thursday. (Chandler doesn’t say anything until Joey figures it out.)
You got me the audition?! Let’s hug it up! (They hug.)"
270,Chandler," Okay. Okay. (Joey puts him down.) What are you gonna do to me if you
get the part?"
271,Phoebe, (entering) Hey! Hi!
272,Rachel, Hi!
273,Phoebe," (To Rachel) Listen umm, yeah okay, I need to talk to you!"
274,Rachel, Uh-huh.
275,Phoebe," Now I know that they said that the umm, the hair straightener started
the fire but I think I’m partly at fault. You see, I didn’t, I didn’t tell
you but umm, but I-I had recently refilled the tissues and so y’know let’s just
face it, that’s just kindling! So I think it’s better that I stay at
Joey’s."
276,Rachel," No, no-no-no. Phoebe, this was my fault and besides y’know what?
I’m fine here."
277,Phoebe," Okay. Oh umm, Chandler, Monica is looking for you."
278,Chandler, Really?
279,Phoebe, Yeah she said something about crumbies.
280,Chandler, No! No! No! I was so careful! (Runs out.)
281,Phoebe," (To Rachel) Okay, you have to switch with me! Monica is driving me
crazy!"
282,Joey," That’s right, all the ladies want to stay at Joey’s."
283,Rachel," No! No! Phoebe, come on! I don’t want to switch! Please come on! I
can throw wet paper towels here!"
284,Phoebe, No but at Monica’s you can eat cookies over the sink!
285,Rachel, I know. I’m sorry.
286,Phoebe," All right fine! This looks like so much fun. (Examining the bowl of wet
paper towels.)"
287,Joey, Yeah. 
288,Phoebe," God, what a mess. (She grabs the bowl and heads for Monica’s.)"
290,Ross," Wow! It actually is in the handbook. I can’t date you or have a hot
plate in my office. I can’t believe we have to stop seeing each other."
292,Ross," I know, I know I really like you too. But we-we can’t date. It’s
against the rules. It’s forbidden."
294,Ross, What?
296,Ross, Really?
298,Ross," Well I-I-I don’t care how hot it is it’s-it’s uh, it’s
wrong."
300,Ross," (feeling it too) No! No! It’s wrong! It’s-it’s-it’s
naughty. It’s taboo."
303,Ross, Let’s also get a hot plate!
307,Chandler, Hey!
308,Joey, Hey!
309,Chandler, So?!
310,Joey, So?
311,Chandler, It’s Thursday! How was the audition?!
312,Joey," Wh? Monday, one day. Tuesday, two day. Wednesday, when huh what?
Thurs—(He gasps in horror.) Oh! (Runs out and Chandler just shakes his head. After a
second Joey runs back in to grab a piece of pizza and runs back out.)"
0,Joey," Well that thing is clearing in the way! All right. Ah-ha! (He grabs a
screwdriver and starts to attack the compressor, only he causes a small short circuit and
shocks himself.) Ah-ah!! Damn fridge! "
2,Rachel," Hi Joey, how ya doin’?"
3,Joey, Great! Roomie!
4,Rachel," Huh, yeah I guess we are roommates now."
5,Joey," Yeah! Well, now that you brought it up, our fridge is broken. We have to
get a new one. Now, I checked around and your half is $400. Thanks a lot."
6,Rachel," I’m not paying for half of that! I’m only staying here until
my apartment gets fixed."
7,Joey," Look Rach, my parents bought this fridge just after I was born, okay? Now,
I have never had a problem with it. Then you show up and it breaks! What does that
tell ya’?"
8,Rachel, That refrigerators don’t live as long as people.
9,Joey," All right, now you know that the ATM will only lets you take out 300 at a
time, I’ll take a check for the other hundred."
10,Rachel, You’re jokin’ right?
11,Joey, Of course I’m jokin’! I don’t take checks.
12,Rachel, Thank God you’re pretty. (Exits.)
15,Rachel, Hey!
17,Rachel, Do you guys know any cute guys?
18,Chandler," Well, of course I do! My good friend Joey over here. (Pats Joey’s
arm, Joey pats Chandler’s shoulder, and Chandler motions for Joey to say the same
about him.)"
19,Joey," Oh, I’m sorry. Thank you Chandler."
20,Rachel," Anyway, there’s this big charity ball this weekend and Ralph Lauren
bought a table, so I kinda have to go…"
21,Monica, What’s the charity?
22,Rachel," I don’t know, something either trees or disease—Ralph mumbles
a lot."
23,Monica, Does Ralph mumble when you’re not paying attention?
24,Rachel, Yeah! It’s weird. But the thing is need to find a date.
25,Phoebe," Well, what kind of guy are you looking for?"
26,Rachel," Well, someone that has his own tux, or has the ability to rent a
tux."
27,Chandler, So he has to be a male who has at least $50.
28,Joey, Ooh! So close.
30,Ross, Hey everybody!
32,Ross," Hey uh, this is Elizabeth."
36,Chandler, (laughs) Isn’t she cute? (On Monica’s death stare) No!
37,Phoebe," Y’know, this is probably none of my business, but weren’t you
guys supposed to not be seen in public together?"
39,Ross," Oh no-no-no, we’re just two people who happen to run into each other
here at the coffee house. (He winks at her.)"
40,Phoebe," Oh, sly."
44,Ross, Bye.
47,Ross, Oh that is quite all right ma’am. (Elizabeth exits.)
48,Chandler," So, why is she leaving? Is it a school night and she has a lot of
homework to do?"
49,Ross," Yes, her molecular epidemiology paper is due tomorrow."
50,Chandler," Oh, tell her good luck with that."
51,Ross, Anyone else? Huh? Bring ‘em on!
52,Rachel, Oo! When’s her birthday?!
53,Ross," I don’t know Rachel, why?"
54,Rachel," Well, y’know it’s just been so long since I’ve been to Chuckie
Cheese."
55,Monica," Oh, I like Elizabeth."
56,Ross, Well thanks!
57,Monica," Yeah. In fact, I like her so much you tell her I want my cookies early
this year! Y’know, a box of Thin Mints and some Tag-a-Longs."
58,Joey," Hey-hey come on you guys, give him a break. Ross, seriously, how’s it
going with her?"
59,Ross," Well, actually it’s been great. She’s 20 so she’s not
looking for anything too serious, which is perfect for me right now."
60,Monica," Well that is great. And seriously, she seems very nice."
61,Ross," Thanks. I know you guys like to give me a hard time and all, but it really
means a lot to me that you like her. Just knowing that you guys are…"
62,Phoebe," (interrupting) Okay, I got a good one. Okay, umm, what is she? Like 12?"
64,Monica," Chandler, do you think we talk about our relationship enough?"
65,Chandler, Yeah. Do we have any Fruit Roll-Ups?
66,Phoebe, (entering) Hey!
67,Monica, Hey!
68,Phoebe," Okay, I just thought of the perfect guy for Rachel to take to her thing."
69,Chandler, Oh that’s so funny because we found someone too.
70,Phoebe," Oh that’s good, I guess she’ll have a choice between my guy
and your weirdo."
71,Chandler, Why would our guy be a weirdo?
72,Phoebe, ‘Cause that’s just your taste.
73,Monica, (laughs sarcastically) Rachel is not going to pick your stupid guy.
74,Phoebe, Oh yeah?
75,Monica, Yeah!
76,Phoebe," My guy is a lawyer who has volunteer work. And, he has one of these (She
squeezes the skin on her chin together to form…)"
77,Chandler, A face ass?
78,Phoebe, A chin dimple!
79,Monica," Well, uh y’know, our guy works with Chandler and he’s really
nice and smart and he’s a great dresser!"
80,Phoebe, Have you seen your guy’s body?
81,Chandler," No, our guy is just a floating head."
82,Phoebe," Well my guy is spectacular. Okay? He’s a massage client and one
time umm, when he was on the table, I looked at it. And I mean all of it."
83,Monica, You’re not supposed to look!
84,Phoebe," Oh yeah, like there are police for that!"
85,Chandler, (horrified) Wait! You look? You-you massaged me.
86,Phoebe, I know. (Laughs.)
87,Monica," All right fine, your guy may have a great body, but our guy is really
funny."
88,Phoebe," Oh, Chandler funny?"
89,Monica, Our guy’s a great dancer!
90,Phoebe, My guy is well read.
91,Chandler, Our guy has great hair.
92,Phoebe, My guy has great teeth!
93,Chandler, Our guy smells incredible.
94,Monica, (To Chandler) Do you want our guy to be your guy?
96,Chandler, Hey.
97,Joey, Huh.
98,Chandler," Well, you…don’t look good Joe."
99,Joey," The fridge broke. I have to eat everything. Cold cuts, ice cream,
limes—Hey, what was in that brown jar?"
100,Chandler, That’s still in there?!
101,Joey," Not anymore. So anyway, how do you want to pay me?"
102,Chandler, Is this a service you’re providing me?
103,Joey, No! No! No! For my new fridge—our new fridge!
104,Chandler, Our new fridge? I don’t live here anymore.
105,Joey," So what? Look, suppose we were a divorced couple."
106,Chandler, Uh-huh.
107,Joey," And I got custody of the kid, right? Now suppose the kid dies and-and I
gotta buy a new kid."
108,Chandler," (not quite sure where Joey’s going and is a little worried)
Okay…"
109,Joey, (pause) Give me $400!
112,Ross," Hmm? (Turns around and sees that its Elizabeth) Oh, a student I don’t
know."
114,Ross," Yes, yes of course, what-what would this be regarding?"
116,Ross," Shh! (Laughs then composes himself) Of course, why don’t we go
inside?"
118,Ross, Oh-ooh!
120,Ross, Doorknob! Doorknob!
122,Ross," Oh, okay. What-what about?"
124,Ross, Spring vacation.
128,Ross," (quickly jumping away from Elizabeth) Yes, professor
Feesen-sen-stenlger… I’ll be with you in one moment. (To Elizabeth) So, I will
take one box of the Thin Mints. (And he ushers Elizabeth out of the office.)"
130,Ross," You don’t understand! Elizabeth was about to ask me to go on a trip
with her! Is that taking it slow?! No, I’m not ready for this! Okay? What-what do I
tell her?"
131,Chandler, Just tell her the truth! Tell her you’re not ready.
132,Ross," I can do that. Oh-oh, what if she gets upset?"
133,Chandler, Then you distract her with a Barbie doll.
134,Joey," Or! You can just, y’know… (He walks up close to whisper in
Ross’s ear and when he gets there he pushes Ross into the fridge.)"
135,Ross, What the hell are you doing?
136,Joey, What? What the hell am I doing? You just broke my fridge!
137,Ross," What?! What? How do you, how do you even know its broken?!"
138,Joey," Oh-ho-ho, you think I don’t know what breaks my fridge? Excuse me!
(He opens the door and feels inside.) Well what do you know! Broken! That’ll be $400!"
139,Chandler," Joey, I saw you push him!"
140,Joey, (pause) You pushed him!
141,Ross," Joey, I did not break this! Okay? (He opens the freezer and smells inside
and recoils in disgust.) That has been broken for a while."
142,Joey," All right. Chandler, do you remember how I told you about our fridge?"
143,Chandler, Uh-huh.
144,Joey, I still haven’t gotten a check for your half yet.
145,Ross, Do not give him any money!
146,Joey, I’m not talking to you! You broke my fridge!
149,Ross," Yes. Yes! Please, come in."
151,Ross, Oo-oo!
153,Ross," Yeah, it kinda grows on you. (They both laugh.) Actually, I wanted to
finish talking to you about uh, spring vacation."
155,Ross," Look, I… (He has trouble sitting in his chair.) Look, I’m having
a great time with you and I just don’t want us to move to fast or put to much
pressure on us. So, I’m sorry I just don’t think we should go away together yet.
It’s-it’s too soon."
157,Ross," No. I think you misunderstood what I was saying. What I meant
was…"
159,Ross, That! Let’s talk about that.
161,Ross, Hey!
162,Chandler, Hey!
163,Phoebe, Hey!
164,Monica, Hey! How did it go with Elizabeth?
165,Ross," Huh? Oh-oh, it was fine. Uh, it was just a misunderstanding. She
didn’t want me to go with her. She just wanted to let me know that she’s going
to Florida for spring vacation."
166,Chandler," Wait a minute, is she going for spring vacation or is she going for
spring break? (Does a little whooping/party noise.)"
167,Ross, What’s-what’s the difference?
168,Monica," Well, spring vacation is doing nice things with your grandparents.
Spring break you’re doing frat guys."
169,Ross," Hey, y’know what? Not all spring breaks are like that."
170,Phoebe, What did you do on yours?
171,Ross, I went to Egypt with my dad.
172,Chandler," I can see it now, ""Look dad, it’s the Sphinx!"" (Does
that party noise again.)"
173,Ross," Hey, I think Elizabeth is a little more serious than, ""Spring
break!"" (Imitates the party noise.) All right? I mean she’s taken my class!"
174,Monica, And slept with the professor.
175,Ross, I’m gonna call her.
176,Chandler, Yeah.
178,Rachel," Hey! You guys umm, I want you to meet Sebastian."
180,Rachel," We just uh, we just met at the newsstand. We both grabbed for the last Field
& Stream. (Chandler’s shocked.) What? I read that."
182,Rachel, Oh yes! Thank you! (He does so and Rachel sits down on the couch.)
183,Phoebe," Rachel, what the hell is this?!"
184,Rachel, (shocked) What?
185,Phoebe," You ask us to find you a guy and you come traipsing in here with your
own!"
186,Rachel, You found me a guy?
187,Monica, Yes! We found you a really cute and funny guy from Chandler’s work!
188,Phoebe, Yeah and I-I found you one too who is not a weirdo.
189,Rachel," Well, y’know what though you guys? I really appreciate that but I
think I’m just gonna take Sebastian to the charity."
190,Chandler, Are you sure?! Because our guy smells incredible!
191,Monica," Uh, would you stop it with that already?!"
194,Rachel," Oh, thank you."
196,Phoebe," So, Sebastian, do you do any volunteer work?"
198,Phoebe," No reason, it’s just I know a single guy that cares about other
people."
199,Chandler, Are you funny?
201,Rachel, What are you guys doing?
202,Monica, Are you funny? Tell us a joke!
204,Phoebe," Well, so do a lot of people."
206,Rachel," Oh, but y’know, no, you didn’t give me your phone number."
208,Chandler, (To Monica) Turns out he is kinda funny. 
211,Rachel," I cannot believe you guys! He was really nice and he left because of
you!"
212,Chandler," Yeah, but Sebastian? What is that? A cat’s name?"
213,Phoebe," Yeah, y’know what I noticed Rachel? He scares easy. Is that the
kind of guy you’d like to take to a ball? ""Hey Sebastian, would you like to
dance?"" (Imitates him.) ""Uhh, okay—I gotta go!"""
214,Monica," All right guys stop it. Rachel, we’re very sorry that is a very
insensitive thing for us to do. And y’know what? Let us make it up to you, we have
two really great guys for you."
215,Phoebe," Yeah! What have you got to lose? Y’know you might even end up with
someone really special (whispers) if you pick my guy."
216,Rachel, All right.
217,Chandler," Okay, so you will meet our guys?"
218,Rachel," Yes, I’ll meet ‘em."
219,Chandler," Okay now it doesn’t matter which one you choose, y’know?
It’s completely up to you. Our guy is perfect, or you can go out with the guy Phoebe
deemed not good enough to go out with herself."
220,Joey," (entering) Pheebs! There you are! Okay, you broke my fridge; you owe me
400 bucks!"
221,Phoebe, Okay sure!
222,Joey, Really?!
223,Phoebe," Ooh, technically you owe me $600 for sending out happy thoughts on your
last ten auditions."
224,Joey, Call it even?
225,Phoebe, Okay.
227,Chandler," (To Ross) Well, there you are! So what did Elizabeth say?"
228,Ross," Well, it turns out that she is going to Daytona for spring break woo-hoo.
That means, that means wet T-shirt contests, guys doing shots off of girl’s bodies,
waking up next to people you don’t even know…"
229,Joey," Man, she is going to have a great time! Is she staying at the Hotel
Corona?"
230,Chandler, You know the hotels?
231,Joey, Sure! I was there! Spring Break ’81! Woo-hoo!
232,Monica, In 1981 you were 13!
233,Joey," So what? I drove down, sold T-shirts, had a blast. And y’know who
knows how to party? Drunk college chicks."
234,Ross," Okay, she can’t go."
235,Phoebe," Ross, you can’t tell her not to go. You just started dating."
236,Ross, Then what am I supposed to do?
237,Phoebe," Nothing, you just have to be cool with it."
238,Ross," Well, what is she goes down and-and sleeps with a bunch of guys?"
239,Chandler," Well, maybe you don’t marry this one."
241,Ross, I’m so glad you’re going on this trip!
243,Ross," Sure. Sure. Look I don’t, I don’t know if your plans are
finalized yet, but umm, hey I-I know another great way to blow off steam."
245,Ross, Are you into crafts at all?
247,Ross," Well, yeah, of-of course I’m okay! What? I’m just being
supportive. Supportive of you and this whole trip, and-and (notices something) what-what
is uh, what’s this? (He holds up a rather skimpy bathing suit.)"
249,Ross, To wear in front of people?
251,Ross, Is this?!
253,Monica, Hey!
254,Chandler, Good-good-good-good.
255,Monica, Hey!
256,Chandler, Hey!
257,Rachel, Hi!
258,Monica, We’re really glad you decided to meet our guy.
259,Rachel, Oh…
260,Monica," You’re gonna like him so much. So umm, when do you want to meet
him?"
261,Rachel, I don’t know. I know I don’t work late tomorrow night.
262,Chandler," Tomorrow night is good. Tomorrow night is good, but uh, y’know
what? Why put off something till tomorrow that you can do right now? (Laughs) Eldad come
here! (He stands up from the next table.)"
263,Rachel, What?
264,Monica," Eldad, this is Rachel."
266,Rachel, Well-well a little blind sided but y’know good.
267,Chandler," Eldad, sit down. (To Rachel) Move over! Move over now!"
268,Rachel, I—Ohh! (Moves over and lets Eldad sit on the couch.)
269,Chandler, There you go! There you are! (Rachel stares at Monica and Chandler)
270,Monica," Okay! Okay! We can take a hint! (They start to leave but run into Phoebe
with her guy in tow.) (To Phoebe) What are you doing here?!"
271,Phoebe, This is Patrick. (Points to him.)
273,Chandler," Hi. (To Phoebe) Okay, you’re too late okay? Because she’s
already with our guy."
274,Phoebe," (looks) Oh my God, you’re right! I am too late; they’re
sitting on the couch and talking! (To Patrick) Come on! (They go over to the couch.)
Rachel?"
275,Rachel, Yeah?
276,Phoebe, This is Patrick.
277,Rachel," Oh, hi."
279,Phoebe," Yeah, this is the guy I was telling you about. "
280,Rachel, Yeah?
281,Phoebe," Yeah. And believe me, this suit does not do justice to what’s
underneath it."
282,Rachel," Oh-okay, but Pheebs?"
283,Phoebe, Yeah?
284,Rachel, I’m just sort of in the middle of something.
285,Phoebe," Oh! Okay! Yeah, that’s okay. (To Patrick) Have a seat. (Sits
Patrick down next to Rachel.)"
286,Monica, No! You can’t do that!
288,Monica, (stopping him) Sit down! We’re winning!
289,Rachel," Okay, y’know what? Maybe I should go!"
291,Monica, Rachel! Rachel! You haven’t touched Eldad’s hair!
292,Chandler, It is the softest hair! Touch it! (Both he and Monica do so.)
293,Rachel," Yeah, I’m good."
294,Phoebe, Rachel? Patrick is really rich. (To Patrick) Give her some money.
296,Monica," That’s right Patrick, bye-bye!"
297,Chandler," (To Rachel) Eldad is much more cooperative! And he can dance! (To
Eldad) You dance for Rachel!"
299,Rachel," No-no! Don’t dance for me! Please? Don’t! (She gets up to yell
at her ‘friends.’) What is the matter with you guys?"
300,Phoebe," Yeah, okay, let’s talk it out."
301,Rachel, I… Am I the only one that this is embarrassing for?
303,Rachel," I’ll tell ya who should be embarrassed! It’s you guys! Come
on! This is ridiculous! Thank you very much, but I do not need you to get me a date!"
304,Phoebe, Then why did she ask us to…
305,Rachel," I am still talking!! And then you chase away the one guy that I actually
liked! I mean, no offense to you guys. Really! I mean (To Patrick) congratulations on all
the cash, (He nods) and-and y’know—(Feels Eldad’s hair)—Wow! You do
have very soft hair! But I would much rather go to the ball all by myself than go through
anymore of this! Good-bye! (Grabs her stuff, starts to leave, then turns back suddenly,
and to Eldad) Now do you use some sort of special conditioner on that hair?!"
307,Rachel, Thank you! (Storms out.)
309,Ross," So uh, have a great time down there."
311,Ross," Yeah. And did you, did you pack that bathing suit?"
313,Ross," It was pretty funny when I, when I hid it for a while, huh? Anyway, umm,
I-I am worried about that bathing suit, not because it’s revealing which I’m
fine with, no I’m concerned about your health, sun exposure."
315,Ross," Well, if what’s in the bottle is actually 30. I mean sometimes you
get 30, sometimes it’s-it’s get 4, and I swear to God more often than not
it’s just milk."
317,Ross, Really?
319,Ross, Okay. Cool.
324,Ross, Call me!
327,Phoebe," Rachel, we’re sorry for pushing those guys on you."
328,Rachel," Oh that’s all right! Y’know, I ended up having a really good
time. Y’know, the charity was a big success and they raised a lot of money and
awareness."
329,Chandler, So what was it for anyway?
330,Rachel, I wanna say a disease.
331,Joey, (entering) Hey!
333,Joey, I just got this really weird message from Ross. He said turn on MTV.
334,Rachel, Huh. All right.
336,Phoebe," Oh my God, look! That’s Elizabeth!"
338,Rachel, Oh-oh Professor Geller.
339,Joey," Ahh, to be 13 again."
340,Chandler, Yeah.
0,Joey," The reactor’s gonna blow in three seconds, we’re never gonna
make it!"
1,Phoebe, You’ve got to get out of here! Save yourself!
2,Joey, No! I won’t leave you!
3,Phoebe," Don’t worry about me, I’m a robot! I’m just a machine!!"
4,Joey, No you’re not! Not to me!
5,Phoebe, (she stops reading from the script) Oh my God.
6,Joey, What?
7,Phoebe, I am extremely talented!
8,Joey," Yeah, you’re great! Okay, let’s take it from…"
9,Phoebe," (interrupting) No, I mean I was really acting my ass off."
10,Joey," Yeah, I thought I was pretty good too."
11,Phoebe," Oh yeah, you’re solid. Yeah, you’re just no me."
12,Joey," Y’know what? I think that’s enough for now. Yeah. I don’t
want to be over rehearsed."
13,Phoebe," (tremendously overacting) Fine! I’ll do it without you! (Joey gives
her thumbs up) I don’t need you or anybody else! I’m gonna make it on my own!
(Joey closes the door to his bedroom.) You’ll see!! You’ll all see!! "
16,Chandler," (To Joey) So uh, what’s this thing you’re auditioning for?"
17,Joey," Oh, it’s a new TV show. Yeah. I’m up for the part of Mac
Macaveli or ""Mac."" Yeah, I’m a detective and I solve crimes with the help
of my robot partner. He’s a, he’s a Computerized Humanoid Electronically
Enhanced Secret Enforcer or-or ""C.H.E.E.S.E."""
18,Rachel, So Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.
19,Joey," That’s the title! Yeah! Y’know they really lucked out that the
initials spell cheese."
20,Chandler, That is lucky.
21,Rachel," Huh—Wait so Joey if you get this, you’re gonna be like the
star of your own TV show! I mean you’ll be like the Big Cheese! (To Phoebe) Or the
Big Mac—Hey! You love those!"
22,Joey," Well, don’t get your hopes up, because probably not gonna happen."
23,Chandler," Now-now, why would you say that Joseph?"
24,Joey," I mean come on you guys! My own TV show? I just don’t know if
I’m good enough."
25,Phoebe, I am.
26,Rachel," Joey, what are you talking about? You’re a terrific actor."
27,Joey, You really think so?
28,Rachel," Ugh, how can you even ask that question?!"
31,Chandler,"  Whoa, she's pretty. (Mentioning the girl on TV)"
32,Joey,"  Yeah, and oh she's really nice too. She taught me all about how to
work the cameras, and smell-the-fart acting."
33,Rachel,"  I'm sorry, what?"
34,Monica,  What?
35,Ross,  Excuse me?
36,Joey,"  It's like, you got so many lines to learn so fast, that sometimes
you need a minute to remember your next one. So while you're thinkin' of it, you take this
big pause where you look all intense, you know, like this. (Does this intense look where
it looks like he's smelling a fart.)"
37,Chandler,"  Oh, ok."
38,Joey," (there's a gunshot on TV) There's my scene, there's my scene. [Joey on
tv] ""Mrs. Wallace, I'm Dr. Drake Ramoray, your sister's neurosurgeon.  I'm
afraid the situation is much worse than we expected. Your sister is suffering from
a..."" (Does the smell-the-fart look.)"
40,Joey," (on stage in an Austrian accent) Vell, Eva, ve've done some excellent vork
here, and I vould have to say, your pwoblem is qviiite clear. (He goes into a song and
dance number.) "
43,Joey,"  I play Al Pacino's butt. All right? He goes into the shower, and
then- I'm his butt.

Monica (trying not to laugh) Oh my God.

Joey  C'mon, you guys. This is a real movie, and Al Pacino's in it, and
that's big!

Chandler Oh no, it's terrific, it's- it's- y'know, you deserve this, after all
your years of struggling, you've finally been able to crack your way into show business.

Joey Okay, okay, fine! Make jokes, I don't care! This is a big break for me!

Ross You're right, you're right, it is."
44,Monica,  Yes.
45,Ross,  So you gonna invite us all to the big opening?
47,Joey," All right well, I’m outta here. Wish me luck."
48,Phoebe," (overacting with a song this time) (singing) Gooood luck! Gooood
luck! We all wish you good luuuuuuuuck!!!"
49,Joey," Yeah, whatever. (Exits.)"
51,Ross, It’s your turn.
52,Chandler," Oh, are we playing this?!"
53,Joey," (entering, dejectedly) Hey."
54,Chandler, Hey! How’d the audition go?
55,Joey," Terrible! I messed up every line! I shouldn’t even be
an actor!"
56,Ross," Wait a minute, are you doing that thing where you pretend it didn’t
go well but it really did go well?"
57,Joey," Yeah, did I fool ya?"
58,Ross, Totally!
59,Chandler, So it did go well.
60,Joey," Oh, it went amazingly well!"
61,Ross, Great!
62,Chandler, Oh that’s great!
63,Joey," Yeah-yeah, it’s down to me and two other guys."
64,Chandler, Oh my God!
65,Ross, Wow!
66,Joey," And I know both of them, they’re really good. One of them is the guy
from those allergy commercials who’s always getting chased by those big flowers…"
67,Ross," Oh, I love that guy! (Laughs.)"
68,Chandler," Oh-oh, what are you doing?"
69,Ross, (stops laughing) What am I doing?
70,Joey," I’m just so nervous! Y’know? The callback isn’t until
tomorrow at five. I feel like my head is going to explode!"
71,Chandler," Well, it is overdue."
72,Ross," Look, don’t worry. Okay? You’re gonna be fine."
73,Joey," There’s just so much pressure. I mean no offense, but what you guys
do is very different. I don’t know if you’d understand."
74,Ross," Yeah, none of us have to deal with pressure at our jobs."
77,Chandler," (on phone) Yes, Fran. I know what time it is, but I'm looking at the
WENUS and I'm not happy!"
79,Monica,"  Alright, well I'm tearing the lettuce."
81,Monica,"  Oh-oh, no no don't worry, I'm gonna wash it."
83,Monica,  That's your call.
85,Monica,"  Well, I thought that I would cut up the tomatos."
87,Monica,  They'r alright.
89,Monica,"  No really, they're OK."
91,Monica,"  Actually, I was gonna do them jullienne."
93,Monica,  I'm outa here. [Monica leaves]
96,Rachel,"  (on the phone) Monica, I’m quitting! I just helped an 81 year
old woman put on a thong and she didn’t even buy it! (Pause) I’m telling you
I’m quitting! That’s it! I’m talking to my boss right now! (Pause) Yes I
am! (Pause) Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Okay bye, call me when you
get this message. (Hangs up.)"
98,Monica,"  Well, what happened?"
99,Phoebe,"  Well, he came in for a massage and everything was fine until...
(The flashback shows Paulo lying face down on the massage table and slowly moving his
hands up Phoebe's legs and grabbing her butt.)"
101,Ross,  Oh my God!
102,Phoebe,"  And all of the sudden his hands weren't the problem anymore. (The
flashback shows Paulo rolling over and showing Phoebe his equipment.)"
103,Monica,  Was it...
104,Phoebe,"  Oh, Boy Scouts could've camped under it!"
106,Ross, You ate my sandwich?
108,Ross, (getting upset) Oh-oh really? 
110,Ross, (jumping to his feet in anger) What?
112,Ross, You-you-you-you (trying to remain in control) threw my sandwich away!
114,Ross,"  (losing control, we hear him shout outside) MY SANDWICH?!!!"
116,Ross, MY SANDWICH!!!!!! (Ross's scream scares a flight of pigeons away.)
118,Joey," I want this part so much! Y’know? If I don’t get this part
I’m never gonna eat Macaroni and Cheese again!—No, I didn’t say
that! That’s a lie."
120,Chandler," Oh come on guys, it’s not like I moved to Europe! I just moved
across the hall! And we would have you over all the time if it weren’t for
(struggles to get this out) Monica’s allergies. (The duck quacks.) You’re right,
I could never lie to you. She hates you. (The phone rings.) Should I get that? (Laughs,
then answers the phone.) Hello? (Listens) Uh no, Joey’s not here right now. Can I
take a message? (Listens) Yeah, okay so the audition has been moved from 500 to 230?
(Listens) Okay great. (Listens.) Bye. (Hangs up the phone and goes to write the message on
the Magna-Doodle on the door but Monica walks in and forces him to jump out of the
way.)"
121,Monica, (startled) Ahh! Aren’t you dressed yet?
122,Chandler, (looks down at his clothes) Am I naked again?!
123,Monica, We’re supposed to meet my parents in 15 minutes.
124,Chandler," Yeah okay, I was just talking to the guys. Just look at them I mean,
is it okay if they come visit?"
125,Monica, Wh?! What about my allergies?!
126,Chandler," Oh right, your allergies. (Monica leaves and to the chick and duck)
All her, she hates you. (Chandler leaves without finishing the message for Joey.)"
128,Joey," Yes!! Ha-ha!! All right! Hey! How cool would it be if you could watch like
a real life-sized version of this? Huh? I mean how crazy would that be?"
129,Chandler, As crazy as soccer?
131,Joey," (on phone) Hello? (Listens) What are you talking about? The
audition’s not ‘til 500! (Chandler suddenly remembers and looks at the
unfinished message then tries to sneak over and finish it as Joey listens.) Well, nobody
told me! (Listens) Who’d you talk to? (Listens and turns around to see Chandler
trying to finish the message.) Nevermind! (Hangs up.)"
132,Chandler, You mean you didn’t get it from this?
133,Joey, The allergy guy got the part! Thanks!
134,Chandler," Well, maybe we can fix it y’know? Maybe we can send him some-some
big-big flowers and scare him!"
135,Joey," How could you do this to me Chandler?! This part could’ve turned my
whole career around!"
136,Chandler," I messed up. Okay? I’m sorry, I really messed up."
137,Joey," Hey, you don’t even live here anymore! What are you doing answering
my phone? I have my machine!"
138,Chandler," Which I bought for ya. Taught ya how to use it. You thought it was a
copier. Look, if there was anything I could do, I would do it. Okay? But everybody’s
allowed one mistake, right?"
140,Chandler,"  You know he coulda gotten me a VCR, he coulda gotten me a set of
golf clubs, but no, he has to get me the woman repeller!  The eyesore from the
Liberace house of crap!"
141,Phoebe,  It's not that bad.
142,Chandler,"  Oh, yeah, easy for you to say, you don't have to walk around
sporting some reject from the Mr. T collection. [Joey walks in behind Chandler]"
143,Phoebe,"  Chandler, Chandler."
144,Chandler,"  I pity the fool who puts on my jewelry, I do, I do. I pity the
fool that. . . [turns around and sees Joey] Hi!"
146,Chandler,"  Yeah, I mean when you were late last night, Kathy and I got to
talking, and one thing to another and…"
147,Joey,  And what?! Did you sleep with her?!
148,Chandler,  No! No! No! I just kissed her.
149,Joey,  What?!! That’s even worse!!
150,Chandler,  How is that worse?!
151,Joey,  I don’t know! But it’s the same!
152,Chandler,"  You’re right, I have no excuses! I was totally over the
line."
153,Joey,"  Over the line?! You-you’re-you’re so far past the line,
that you-you can’t even see the line! The line is a dot to you!"
155,Chandler," Look, I’m not saying that you should magically forgive me! But
you’re not perfect! You’ve made some errors in judgment too!"
156,Joey, Name one!
158,Chandler, (lets him out) What happened?!!
159,Joey," (getting out) Awww, man! He promised he wouldn’t take the chairs!!"
160,Chandler,"  What the hell happened?!! How were you locked in?!! And where
the hell is all of our stuff?!!"
161,Joey,"  Well, this guy came by to look at the unit and-and he said he
didn’t think big enough to fit a grown man!"
162,Chandler,  So--You got in voluntarily?!
163,Joey,"  I was tryin’ to make a sale!! Oh, man, if I ever run into that
guy again, do you know what I’m gonna do?"
164,Chandler,  BEND OVER?!!!
166,Chandler," Ok, now, remember, no trading. You get the pretty one, I get the mess."
168,Chandler, ...And what did you bring?
170,Chandler, Janice?
172,Chandler, Janice?!
175,Chandler, Joey's tailor...took advantage of me.
176,Ross, What?
177,Joey, No way!  I've been going to the guy for 12 years.
178,Chandler," Oh come on!  He said he was going to do my inseam, and he ran his
hand up my leg, and then, there was definite..."
179,Ross, What?
180,Chandler, Cupping.
181,Joey," That's how they do pants!  Ross, will you tell him? Isn't that how
they measure pants?"
182,Ross," Yes, yes it is. In prison!"
184,Joey, I said name one!
187,Chandler, I can’t believe I did this! What an idiot!
188,Monica," Oh, stop beating yourself up! People make mistakes! These things happen!
There aren’t any message you’ve forgotten to give me are there? (Chandler has a
disgusted look on his face.) Apparently you’re not very good at it! I…"
189,Chandler, Do you think he’ll ever forgive me?
190,Rachel," Of course he will! But Chandler the most important thing is you forgive
yourself!"
191,Chandler, Y’know what? I-I kinda have.
192,Rachel, Already? That’s pretty bad what you did.
193,Monica," Y’know what? He will forgive you. And I like to bring a pad
with me when I go answer the phone just in case… (Chandler gets that disgusted look
back.) Okay…"
194,Chandler," You didn’t see how mad he was, y’know?"
195,Rachel," I’m sure he will forgive you. Look, we have all been there!
Y’know, you fight, you make up, it’s just the way it works."
197,Ross, It took two people to break up this relationship!!
198,Rachel," Yeah! You and that girl from that copy place, which yesterday you took
full responsibility for!!"
199,Ross," I didn’t know what I was taking full responsibility for! Okay?! I
didn’t finish the whole letter!"
200,Rachel, What?!!
201,Ross, I fell asleep!
202,Rachel, (mocking him) You fell asleep?!
203,Ross," It was 530 in the morning, and you had rambled on for 18 pages. Front and
back!! (they go into the living room, trapping Monica, Chandler, and Joey in the kitchen)
(to Rachel) Oh-oh-oh, and by the way, Y-O-U-apostrophe-R-E means ‘you are,’
Y-O-U-R means ‘your!’"
204,Rachel," Y'know I can’t believe I even thought about getting back
together again! We are so over!!"
205,Ross," (starts to cry) FINE BY ME!! (he opens the door and traps Chandler behind
it)"
206,Rachel," And hey! Just so you know, it’s not that common! It doesn’t
happen to every guy! And it is a big deal!!"
207,Chandler, (coming out from behind the door) I KNEW IT!!!!
209,Monica, You had no right to go out with him.
210,Rachel, That is the most ridiculous...
211,Monica, You sold me out.
212,Rachel, I did not sell you out.
213,Monica, Yes you did.  You absolutely sold me...
214,Rachel, Would you let me talk. [flicks Monica on the forehead]
215,Monica, Did you just flick me?
216,Rachel," OK, well, you wouldn't let me finish and I was jus- [Monica flicks her
back] Ow. That hurt [flicks Monica]"
218,Phoebe," Oh!  All right.  Now, let's not do this!"
220,Phoebe, Happy thoughts!  Happy thoughts!
222,Phoebe," OK, now I'm gonna kick some ass."
224,Phoebe, I know!  I know!  I know! 
225,Phoebe," Alright, now I will let go if you both stop."
226,Rachel, Fine!
227,Monica, Fine!
228,Phoebe," There we go.You know what, if we were in prison, you guys would be,
like, my bitches."
230,Joey," Okay, buddy-boy. Here it is. You hide my clothes, I'm wearing everything
you own."
231,Chandler, Oh my God!  
232,Joey," Look at me! I'm Chandler! Could I be wearing any more clothes?
Maybe if I wasn't going commando..."
234,Joey," Yeah. Whew, it's hot with all of this stuff on. I ah, I better not do any,
I don't know, lunges. (starts doing lunges)"
241,Chandler," Joey? Got you a Joey Special, two pizzas! Joe? (The phone rings
and he answers it) (On phone) Hello? (Takes the phone away from his mouth when he realizes
what he just did and yells.) Damnit! (Back on phone.) Hello? (Listens.) No, Joey’s
not here right now, but I can take a message I think. (Listens) He’s still got a
chance for the part?! Oh, that’s great news! (Listens) Well no obviously not for the
actor who was mauled by his dog. (Listens) Oh well, that’s great. I will give Joey
the message. Thank you! (Hangs up and goes to write the message on the Magna-Doodle.)
Yes! (Reading what he’s writing) Okay, Mac audition at 200. Allergy actor attacked.
(Pause) By dog not flowers."
243,Joey, Hey!
244,Chandler, Please tell me you got the message!
245,Joey, What message?
246,Chandler," The actor playing Mac couldn’t do it, they needed to see you at 2
o’clock."
247,Joey, What?! It’s 6 o’clock!
248,Chandler," Du-du-I wrote it, I wrote it on the board! I wrote it on the board,
then I went all over New York City looking for ya! I went to Ross’s! I went to the
coffeehouse! I went to any place that they made sandwiches!"
249,Joey, I can’t believe this Chandler!
250,Chandler, Sorry! I-I-I don’t know what to say.
251,Joey," Well you-you-you-you might say congratulations! I saw the board! I went to
the audition! I got the part!!"
252,Chandler," (angrily) Is that supposed to be funny! I was really worried over
here!"
253,Joey," Oh, well I’m uh…"
254,Chandler," Y’know, sometimes that fake out thing is just mean!"
255,Joey," Oh wow! Okay man, I’m sorry. I did not mean to make you feel bad."
256,Chandler," Well that’s good. Because you didn’t! And I’m
incredibly happy for ya!!"
257,Joey, (shocked) That’s mean! You really had me going there!
258,Chandler," Oh, we could do this all day."
259,Joey," Yeah, you’re right. Okay look, listen, let’s talk about what a
huge star I’m gonna be!"
260,Chandler, You are gonna be a huge star! I’m gonna hug ya!
261,Joey, You hug me!
262,Chandler, All right!
265,Joey," Hey, do we do this too much?"
266,Chandler," I think so. Yeah, get off me."
267,Joey, Yeah.
271,Joey," Come on C.H.E.E.S.E., I’m not leaving without you! Try routing your
backup source through your primary CPU."
272,Phoebe," (overacting badly) I can’t! My circuits are fried! They’re
fried I tell you!!"
273,Joey," Wow! (Back to reading the scene.) Well then I’ll just have to carry
you."
275,Ross," That’ll be a neat trick, when you’re, (looks at the script) when
you’re dead!"
276,Joey," Ross, you don’t have to yell."
277,Ross," There was just an explosion, okay? My hearing would be impaired. "
278,Phoebe," I thought you were excellent! In fact for a minute there I was like,
""Ooh, where’d Ross go?"""
279,Ross, Thank you! And I have to say that first scene when you meet Mac…
280,Phoebe, Yeah?
281,Ross, Oh my God. I mean…
282,Joey," Y’know what? I think that’s enough for today. Thanks for your
help! (He grabs their scripts and heads for his room.)"
283,Phoebe, (To Ross) He’s holding us back.
284,Ross, Totally.
0,Rachel," Okay, Chandler!"
1,Chandler, Okay.
2,Rachel," And your horoscope says, ""On the fifth a special someone is going
to give you a gift."""
3,Chandler," (To Monica) Oh, well thank you in advance. (Kisses her.)"
4,Rachel," Op, but the twelfth brings a lover’s spat."
5,Monica," (To Chandler) You are going to make a joke about my special
present! Why would you do that?!"
6,Rachel," Oh, wait and on the nineteenth a secret crush announces itself."
8,Joey, (entering) Hey guys!
9,Chandler, Hey!!
10,Rachel," (ecstatic) Oh my God! It’s Joey Tribbiani of Mac and
C.H.E.E.S.E.!!!!!!!"
12,Chandler," Oh that’s right. It’s your first day! So are you psyched to
fight fake crime with your robot sidekick?"
13,Joey," Am I psyched? The lead in my own TV series? I’ve dreamed about this
for years! Why have I not been preparing?!"
14,Phoebe," No! Joey, you’re going to be great!"
15,Joey," But I got to act with a robot Pheebs, and-and I don’t know anything
about technology! I can’t even use Chandler’s computer except to find porn!
And-and that’s only ‘cause it’s right there when you turn it on!"
16,Monica, I think our lover’s spat will start a little early this month.
17,Phoebe, (in a sexy voice to Chandler) I’ll be waiting.
20,Chandler," Are you judging them by their covers? Because you’re really not
supposed to do that."
21,Phoebe," No, I’m just deciding which one to use—I’m gonna start
writing another book!"
22,Rachel, Be-because the last one was such a big seller?
23,Phoebe," Well, if you must know I have written 14 books. And as I am the only one
who has read them, I can tell you that they all have been very well received. "
24,Ross, (entering) Hey!
25,Chandler, Hey!
26,Rachel, Hey!
27,Ross, What are you guys doing later?
28,Phoebe," Oh, Rachel and I have appointments to get our hair cut."
29,Rachel, (To Phoebe) We do?
30,Phoebe, I want to see what he wants first.
31,Rachel, Okay.
32,Ross, (continuing) I just found out that Elizabeth’s dad wants to meet me.
33,Chandler," Wait a minute, hold the phone! You’re not Elizabeth’s dad?!"
34,Ross," Come on guys, I-I really want this guy to like me. It-it would really help
me out if you guys were here to make me look good."
36,Ross, Thanks!
37,Monica, We know how tough those parent/teacher conferences can be.
40,Joey," Wow! Huh? (Picks up the phone) Mac Macaveli, Private Investigator!"
42,Joey," Okay. Hey uh, when do I get to meet the robot?"
44,Joey, Okay.
46,Joey," Oh wow! He’s so lifelike! (Starts touching the guy’s cheeks)
Unbelievable! (He starts tugging on the guy’s ears."
48,Joey," (slaps Wayne on his cheek) How do you do there, Wayne? (Backs away.)"
50,Joey," Okay. Sorry about that…(Mimics that cheek thing he just did.) Uh, so
where’s C.H.E.E.S.E.?"
53,Joey," (laughs) This is like the temporary robot, right?"
55,Joey," Well, I-I just, I just it was going to be like a really cool robot,
y’know? Like the terminator or uh, when I first saw you."
57,Joey," I’m sorry, it just—I don’t know it doesn’t really look
like it can do anything."
61,Ross, It-it’s great to meet you Paul.
63,Ross," Of course, of course, Mr. Stevens."
65,Ross, Eh-wh—Excuse me?
67,Ross," That’s funny. Umm…. (Pause, then serious) It’s not funny."
69,Ross," Okay. I can, I can see that. Umm, but I think if you give me umm, one
chance I can, I can change your mind."
71,Ross, What?
75,Ross, This is—you—(Ross starts laughing.)
77,Ross," Okay, umm I want you to know that I have never done anything like this
before. I mean, I mean I’ve been in um, relationships in general, uh but I have never
done it with a student—I mean I not—not it! I mean, I mean I
don’t—We haven’t done it. Uh, I mean, I mean,
we’ve-we’ve-we’ve done stuff. (Paul is not amused.) Okay, okay, a joke, a
joke—lighten the mood. Umm, two guys go into a bar. One of them is Irish."
79,Ross, And the Irish guy wins the joke!
81,Monica, Ross!!
82,Chandler, Ross!
83,Monica, How crazy that we’d run into you!
84,Ross," Oh God, thank you! (Runs and gives all of them a group hug.) Umm, uh, Mr.
Stevens I’d like you to meet my friends uh, this is Phoebe, Monica, and Chandler."
85,Phoebe," You’re Elizabeth’s father, huh? I can see now where she gets
her rugged handsomeness."
86,Monica, (obviously attracted to him) Is-is-is there a-a Mrs. Stevens?
87,Chandler, There’s a Mr. Bing!
91,Ross," Okay umm, why don’t we all take a seat, y’know? And uh, and
I’ll get us all some uh some coffees—(He goes to pull out Elizabeth’s
chair, but Paul steps in)—Yeah, why don’t you. (Paul pulls out her chair) Uh and
you guys can talk about whatever, whatever you want. Y’know? Whatever pops into your
head. (He turns his back to Paul and Elizabeth and points to himself for Chandler, Monica,
and Phoebe. Then he goes to order the coffee.)"
92,Monica," Y’know, it is so strange seeing Ross here this time of day,
‘cause usually he’s got the children’s hospital."
93,Phoebe, Yeah. Not looking for dates. (Monica turns in horror.)
95,Monica, And he’s a great brother!
97,Monica, Ohh!
101,Chandler," But uh Ross, Ross is a great guy! I was roommates with him in college.
Uh, funny story… (He starts laughing then notices that Paul isn’t happy.)
You’re roommate in college died didn’t he?"
103,Ross," (returning with the coffee) Okay here we are Paul, Elizabeth. (He sets
down their cups.) So I hope you guys were finding something to talk about."
104,Chandler," Yes, we were just…"
106,Rachel," Hi, I’m sorry I’m late but I am ready, ready to talk you up!
When does Liz’s father get here?"
108,Rachel, Oh! Ross is sooo great!
110,Chandler," Hey honey, you got the kind with the little girl, you said we were
gonna to get the kind with the baby."
111,Monica," No, you said the baby creeps you out."
112,Chandler," No, the little girl creeps me out."
113,Monica, You said the baby.
114,Chandler, Why would the baby creep me out?
115,Monica, Why would the little girl creep you out?
116,Phoebe," (writing frantically) You guys, I’m sorry, could you please talk a
little slower? "
117,Chandler, This is going in your book?
118,Phoebe," Yeah, it’s about relationships. Y’know? The traps, the
pitfalls, what not to do, keep going. This stuff is great!"
119,Monica, What?! Excuse me!
120,Phoebe," And how none of it matters when the people really love each other.
(Chandler and Monica kiss.) And how people will believe anything you tell them as long as
it’s a compliment."
122,Rachel, (seeing him) Oh hi!
124,Rachel," Oh! Well let’s look for them. (Finds some under one of the couch
cushions. It has a pink, fuzzy ball on the key chain.) Oh-oh-hey! Are these them?"
126,Rachel, All right! (Throws them back under the cushion.)
128,Rachel, Oh good.
130,Rachel," (chasing after him) Oh, wait! Sorry, Mr. Paul? Mr. Paul?"
132,Rachel," Paul. Umm, I just wanted you to know that Ross really is a great guy."
134,Rachel, You just don’t look old enough to have a twenty-year-old daughter.
136,Rachel, Oh. We?
138,Rachel," Oh no! Yes! Of course, I know that! I just—I meant y’know are
you still a ‘We’ or are you just ‘You?’"
140,Rachel, (sympathetic) Ohh. So you raised her all on your own?
142,Rachel, Ohh. (She touches his arm for support and likes what she feels) Ooh!
144,Joey, Hey!
145,Chandler, Hey!
146,Phoebe, Hey!
147,Monica, How was your first day?
148,Joey, Pretty great! Except I did get a little attitude from the robot.
149,Chandler," Damn those robots, they’re supposed to be our faithful
servants!"
150,Joey," Anyway, it wasn’t the robot, it was the guy who controls him. Yeah,
he doesn’t like me. He had C.H.E.E.S.E. knock over the sandwich right when I was
reaching for one! Ohh!"
151,Phoebe," Well, why don’t you just get him fired?"
152,Joey," I may have to, I hate to do it, but I’m the star! Y’know?
There’s a limit to how many sandwiches I can eat off the floor. (His cell phone
rings) Excuse me. (Answers it, on phone) Joey Tribbiani. "
154,Joey, Wow!
156,Joey, I’m the lead in Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.!!
159,Ross, Joey?!
161,Rachel, I was just getting him to like you.
164,Ross, Joey?! Joey!! (He runs into his bedroom.)
165,Rachel," Ross, Joey is not here."
166,Ross," Okay, I’ll just wait for him in here!"
167,Rachel," Ross, it’s okay. You can come out."
169,Ross, (coming out of the bedroom) Oh! Oh my God! I didn’t even see you!
171,Rachel, Bye!
173,Ross, What-what-what the—how da-how did-what the-how did-what?!
174,Rachel," Well, y’know he lost his keys so he was looking for them…"
175,Ross, (incredulous) In your mouth?!
176,Rachel," No! Downstairs! And we got to talking y’know, for like two hours,
and I really liked him so I invited him up here for a cup of coffee."
177,Ross, You were at the coffeehouse!
178,Rachel," Ross, what’s the big deal? So I kissed the guy!"
179,Ross," He is my girlfriend’s father, okay? It’s-it’s, it’s
weird!"
180,Rachel, Wh—You dated my sister!
181,Ross, That was different!
182,Rachel, What? Why?!
183,Ross, This is weird for me!
184,Rachel," Ross look, look this is good for you. Okay? Let’s face it, so far
the guy’s not lovin’ ya! But I can turn that around! I got the inside track! We
can all go out to dinner, y’know? And I can talk you up! Ross, the guy is a very, very
successful lawyer!"
185,Ross, How is that important?
186,Rachel, Oh it’s important!
188,Joey," Apparently, there’s like a million guys out there that can play Mac,
and there’s only this one robot and this one guy who controls it! I didn’t know
he could get me fired! What am I going to do?"
189,Monica," Well y’know Joey, you’re a pretty charming guy."
190,Joey," Thanks, but I kinda have a problem to deal with here."
191,Monica," No sweetie, you’ve got to win over the guy that controls
C.H.E.E.S.E.! You’ve got to kiss some serious robot ass!"
192,Joey," That’s not a bad idea. Yeah. Okay, but if I got to turn on the charm
tomorrow I’m not wasting anymore of it over here with you guys. (Starts to leave, but
stops and turns to Phoebe.) Well, actually I got a little bit saved for you Pheebs.
(Exits.)"
193,Chandler," So do you think uh, Joey’s more charming than me?"
194,Monica, Yeah! That’s why I’m sleeping with him on the side.
195,Chandler," Yeah, you wish. (Stops to think about it and gets depressed.)"
196,Phoebe," (writing in her book) ""You wish."""
197,Monica," Phoebe, stop writing about us!"
198,Phoebe, I’m not writing about you! I’m writing about other people.
199,Chandler, Who?
200,Phoebe, Marcia and Chester.
201,Monica," Okay fine! Fine! Then you know what, I’ll just write about Phyllis!
Hmm!"
202,Chandler, Hmm.
203,Monica, (writing on a piece of paper) Phyllis is sitting in a chair.
204,Chandler, Oh.
205,Phoebe, I see what you’re doing!
206,Monica, (still writing) Phyllis sees what I’m doing.
207,Chandler, Oh-oh.
208,Phoebe," Ooh, I have tasted my own medicine and it is bitter!"
210,Joey," Morning! Hey, how’s my favorite genius and my little robot buddy?!
(Pats C.H.E.E.S.E. on the head.)"
212,Joey," Okay! (He yanks his hand away.) All right. Umm, all right Wayne, level
with me. Okay? I-I keep hearing all these rumors that I might get fired. Okay, they even
have actors coming in to read for my part! Come on man, you-you got to give me a second
chance! I mean, I love-I love this little guy! (He grabs C.H.E.E.S.E.’s arm and pulls
it off at the elbow.) Ah-ah!! (Wayne is shocked.) Okay, that’s why you didn’t
want me to touch him right? Here you go! Okay? (Hands Wayne the arm and he goes to fix it.
Meanwhile Joey starts to berate himself.) Stupid! I can’t believe it! God! (A very
beautiful woman walks by.) (To her) Hey, how you doin’? (He and her go over to talk
and Wayne looks on with envy.)"
214,Rachel," So it seemed that my prom date had stood me up, so Ross selflessly,
offered to take me."
217,Rachel," Wow! I definitely did not see that one backfiring! I’m gonna
go to the bathroom."
218,Ross," Yeah, take your time. "
220,Ross," (to Paul) Just-just so you know I was a freshman and she was a senior. So
it wasn’t as bad as-as…"
222,Ross, Not all bad.
224,Ross, Yeah. You know what? I know what you mean; I do that too.
226,Ross," No! No! Not—I don’t mean I-I see her as a twelve-year-old girl!
I mean I-I have a son, who’s umm six and I still think of him as a baby."
228,Ross," Yeah, well my-my ex-wife and I share custody of Ben and umm, uh, and just
so you know, Carol and I are on excellent terms as I’m sure you are with your
wife! (Realizes) Oh, I’m sorry! (To Elizabeth) It’s unbelievable!"
230,Rachel," Oh we were, but that was just a (pause as the audience reacts), I mean
that was just a big drunken mistake."
231,Ross, You’re back.
233,Rachel," Oh! Whoops! I’m sorry, you were talking about Emily!"
236,Monica," Chandler, we said we would meet at the coffeehouse at six."
237,Chandler, We said seven!
238,Monica, We said six!
239,Chandler," The only way that I said six would be if the seven’s, let meet at
seven, not at six."
240,Monica," Yeah and if I had seven, maybe I would’ve said something like this,
""Wow! My boyfriend’s such a wise ass—seven!"""
241,Phoebe, (Turning around in the chair) Hi!
242,Chandler, Oh my good God.
243,Monica, Ugh!
244,Phoebe, I know what time you said.
245,Chandler, What?!
246,Phoebe," Well actually, I know what time Chester and Marcia said."
247,Monica, What time?
248,Phoebe," Quite an interesting turn of events, suddenly it’s my book to the
rescue, huh? (Reading her book) Ooh, very interesting. Yeah, well this certainly clears
things up."
249,Chandler, (disgusted) What does it say?!
250,Phoebe, I will tell you as soon as you thank me for writing my book.
251,Chandler," Thank you for writing your book. Its-its uh, great book and you are
the queen of everything."
252,Phoebe, Thanks! So are you.
253,Chandler," (To Monica) I told you I should not wear this color. (He’s
wearing a reddish-orange sweater.)"
254,Phoebe," (reading from her book) Mon… (Pause as she restarts) Marcia and
Chester are planning on seeing a movie on Sunday night. Marcia thinks they’re
supposed to meet at six, Chester thinks it’s at seven."
255,Chandler, So you knew we were gonna miss the movie!
256,Phoebe, That’s right.
257,Monica, Inside of telling us you decided to write in your stupid book!
258,Phoebe, (writing in her book) Marcia and Chester are mad at Phyllis.
260,Joey, I can’t believe I’m going to lose this job!
261,Chandler, Oh I’m so sorry man! Is there anything I can do?
262,Joey, Yeah! Help me get this mini-fridge past the security guard.
265,Joey," Yeah? Well, I don’t want to talk to you Wayne! I hate you! You ruined
my life! Oh, Chandler, Wayne. Wayne, Chandler. (They shake hands.)"
266,Chandler," Hi, how are ya?"
268,Joey, (incredulous) Why should I help you?!
269,Chandler, (whispering in Joey’s ear) The reason he just said.
270,Joey, (happily) What do you need?
272,Joey, Yeah?
274,Joey, What are you in love with her or something?
276,Chandler," Yeah, I’ve been there my friend."
278,Joey," Oh wow Wayne, it’s not really something you can teach y’know?
It’s pretty much something you’re born with if you—(Off Chandler’s
look)—You-you can teach it! I’ll show you right how to do it."
280,Rachel," I mean if you think about it, I mean Ross did learn something from each
marriage."
282,Rachel," Now wait a minute that’s not fair. He was married to me a hell of a
lot longer than he was married to Emily, he just didn’t tell me. (Everyone looks at
her, Ross not happily.) Maybe I have to pee again. (Gets up to try to use the bathroom.)"
284,Ross," Y’know what? I-I-I… I-I have had enough of this! Y’know,
I-I-I care a great deal about your daughter and I have treated her with nothing but
respect! So if-if you’ve got a problem with me, frankly…"
286,Ross, God no!
289,Ross," Well if it doesn’t matter to her, it doesn’t matter to me! (to
Paul) Still not yelling!"
291,Ross," That’s okay, I’m not so crazy about myself right now either."
293,Ross," Uh yeah, I guess—Yeah! I guess so."
296,Ross, Ohhh! Kids!
297,Rachel," (returning) Wait-wait-wait, I just thought of another story about how
nice Ross is!"
298,Ross," That’s okay Rach, we’re not liking Ross right now."
299,Rachel, Oh! I’ve got a lot of those too!
302,Joey," Well, it turns out you were right C.H.E.E.S.E."
304,Joey," You got it! And the rabbi’s beard, 100% horsehair. Nice catch
C.H.E.E.S.E.! (Pauses as he waits for C.H.E.E.S.E.’s next line.) It’s your line
C.H.E.E.S.E.! (Suddenly C.H.E.E.S.E. goes crazy and starts flinging it’s arms and
advancing on Joey behind the desk.) Wayne! Wayne!!"
0,Phoebe," (dejected) Hi, you guys."
1,Chandler, Hey!
2,Monica, Hi!
3,Rachel, What’s the matter?
4,Phoebe," Well it’s just—it’s one of those situations that I just
hate. Y’know? A massage client gave me three tickets to the Helmet-Pelts exhibit at
the Morgan Chase museum."
5,Joey, (nodding knowingly) Now you’re thinking you gotta sleep with him.
6,Phoebe," No! No! It’s just that he gave me three tickets and there are six
of us!"
7,Chandler, I’ll give up my ticket.
8,Joey, Me too.
9,Phoebe, Okay that’s so generous!
10,Chandler, And I think Ross is generous too.
11,Phoebe, Great! Okay then it’s just us girls!
13,Phoebe, Yeah.
14,Rachel, So what-what is the exhibit.
15,Phoebe," It’s mostly just photographs of lesbian love scenes interspersed
with video games and free sandwiches."
16,Joey, Oh man! (Hits Chandler)
17,Ross, (entering) Hey!
18,Rachel, Hi!
19,Chandler, Hey!
20,Joey," Hey Ross listen Chandler got you out of going to the lesbian sandwich
museum this weekend!"
21,Ross, Thanks? But I have plans; Elizabeth and I are going out of town.
22,Monica, Oh that’s great!
23,Ross, Yeah.
24,Monica, I mean think about all the money that you’re gonna make!
25,Ross, Why? What?
26,Monica," Well, her father pays you for baby-sitting right?"
27,Ross," No, no, that’s funny. But maybe it’s time to move on, let it go,
y’know? Stop it! Besides, Rachel is going out with Elizabeth’s father, so ah,
he’s much older than she is. Looks like I’m not the only one interested in
fossils, huh?"
28,Rachel," I mean Ross all that does is remind us that you are interested in
fossils."
29,Ross," Okay, okay. Uh, well uh, Rachel is going to need to yell sweet nothings
(Paul enters) in his ear. "
31,Chandler, Ross.
32,Ross," Oh, come on you guys; that’s funny! Y’know? Because he’s
need—he’s got like a hearing aide y’know, ‘cause-‘cause
y’know, ‘cause he’s all old, and… "
35,Ross," Really? That okay, that’s great."
37,Ross," All right look, I-I realize it upsets you."
39,Ross," But, Elizabeth and I are-are both adults and so I don’t think
there’s really anything you can do about it."
41,Ross, Ohh! A man with a plan!
44,Phoebe," Oh, this is so exciting! You get your picture back up on the wall of
fame! Eek!"
45,Joey," I know. It was so cool when I was up there before. Me and Jim Belushi
would just be crackin’ up about something… Then I get fired off of Days Of
Our Lives and he takes me down. Now he’s just laughing at me. Look at him, that
smug Belushi bastard, I’ll…"
46,Phoebe," (gasps) Ohh, okay maybe they put your picture back up they can put you
next to Matt Lauer. Look at him, smiling at me. (Giggles) Yeah I know; we’d be great
together!"
48,Joey, Hey! So I’m back.
50,Joey," Joey Tribbiani! From the wall! (The dry cleaner doesn’t remember)
Okay, maybe this will jog your memory, huh? (Holds his picture up in front of his face.)
Huh? Okay eh-ah-anyway, I’m ready to go back up on the wall I’m the star of a
new TV show."
52,Joey," Oh well, it’s not on TV yet."
54,Joey," Okay, fine, I will bring you a tape, huh? (Walks away)"
55,Phoebe," So umm, now do you have any of Matt Lauer’s clothes here? Maybe?
Just ones that haven’t been cleaned yet? "
58,Monica," Oh, I love museums!"
59,Rachel, Umm.
60,Monica, Soakin’ up all the culture.
61,Rachel, Yeah.
62,Monica, Where do you want to start?
63,Rachel," Ooh, the gift shop!"
64,Monica, Yeah!
65,Phoebe," Hey, and then lunch."
66,Rachel," Oh, wait yes, but I can’t eat too much. Paul is taking me out to
dinner tonight, he said he has a big surprise planned."
67,Phoebe," Oh wow. What, do you think maybe he’s gonna tell you that he’s
gay?"
68,Rachel, What?! No! Why?!
69,Phoebe," No reason! That would just be a really big surprise, right?"
72,Rachel, I didn’t know you could get married here.
73,Monica," This would be a beautiful place to get married, yeah, but I
wouldn’t put the aisle there and I would never have the ceremony there!
(Points to both places.) I mean you’d have the ceremony under this big beautiful
arch. (The arch at the entrance to the room.) "
75,Rachel," Oh sorry didn’t mean to interrupt. It’s just such a beautiful
space; do you do a lot of weddings here?"
77,Rachel," Monica, you should totally put your name down on the list"
78,Monica," What?! Are you crazy?! I’m not getting married! I’m not even
engaged."
79,Phoebe," Yeah, but there’s a two-year wait. And then what if you get engaged
in two years and then you got to wait another two years for this place. That’s
four years. Chandler’s not gonna wait that long. He’s gonna find somebody else,
y’know? Someone, someone who did put their name on the list. (Rachel agrees.)"
80,Rachel," Yeah hon, it can’t hurt to put your name down! I mean in if two
years if you’re not engaged you just don’t use it."
81,Monica," Well, I mean I guess there is no harm in putting my name down."
82,Rachel, I’m gonna do it too!
83,Phoebe, Me too!
84,Rachel," Really? Who would, who would you marry?"
85,Phoebe," I don’t know, I don’t have anyone right now. Y’know?"
86,Rachel, Oh Pheebs.
87,Phoebe, Don’t feel too sorry for me. At least my boyfriend isn’t gay.
88,Monica," Phoebe, that stuff is…"
89,Phoebe, Don’t even get me started on yours!
91,Joey," (entering) Hey! So, did you watch the tape of my show?"
93,Joey," All right, let’s get me back up there! (Holds out his picture.)"
95,Joey, What—But you saw the show!
97,Joey, Dry cleaners?
99,Joey," Okay! Okay, look! You-you-you got Harrison Ford up there!"
101,Joey," Okay well that may be true. But, in-in okay, Air Force One the
Russians were terrorists! And evil! And plus he kills a bunch of them!
That-that-that’s offensive to Russians."
103,Joey," Oh you should, it’s great."
106,Ross, This place is really beautiful!
108,Ross," Wow! The only thing I got from my Grandmother was her eyes. I mean not-not
her actual eyeballs, but, but people say that my eyes—Do-do you want to make out?"
112,Ross," Ehh, I was just, I was just thinking about your father."
114,Ross," No. No-no uh, he just, he just really freaked me out before."
116,Ross, Yeah.
119,Ross," (loudly) Why?! Are there like bears or something?! (Looks around and then
sees that Elizabeth is shaking her head no and realizes what Elizabeth meant.) Ohh. Oh,
protection. Yeah-no, yeah-no, that-that-that I forgot."
121,Ross," Oh no! Hey-hey, I’m the guy! I’ll get it."
123,Ross, No.
125,Ross, A little bit.
127,Ross, Okay.
129,Ross," Ohh, okay."
131,Rachel," (from another room) Oh my God, what a great surprise! This is such a
beautiful house."
136,Chandler," (on machine) You’ve reached Monica and Chandler’s, if
you’re listening to this message, we’re probably screening. (to himself) Yeah we
are."
138,Chandler," (on phone) This is Chandler Bing! This is Chandler Bing! (Listens)
Yes, the groom—No! Not the groom!!"
141,Rachel, It’s so secluded up here.
143,Rachel," I feel like we’re the only two people in the world. (She sets down
her wine class, picks up a walnut, and knocks another one on the floor.) Oops. Sorry. (She
reaches down to pick it up and Ross hands it to her. Ross is hiding under the couch and
causes Rachel to scream.)"
145,Rachel," No-no! Big bear! Big bear outside! I think I-I—would
you—actually, would you go check on that?"
147,Rachel," Well, okay. Would-would you get me a Diet Coke?"
149,Rachel," Okay. (After Paul leaves Rachel drops to the floor to confront Ross.)
What?! What are you doing here?!"
150,Ross, What are you doing here?!
151,Rachel, I came with Paul!
152,Ross," Yeah, I recognize the ankles!"
153,Rachel, Get up!
155,Rachel, Ahh. Thank you!
157,Rachel," Op, ice. I need ice."
159,Rachel, Thank you.
161,Ross, (under the couch) You and your ice.
162,Rachel," Ugh! Get out! Get out! Go! Come on! (Ross gets up and heads for the
kitchen.) No! Not in there! He’s in there! (She points Ross to the door next to the
kitchen.)"
163,Ross, (before entering) Did you really hear a bear?
164,Rachel, Go-go!
166,Rachel," Ohh, thank you."
173,Rachel," Well, she-she ob-obviously saw the tire tracks that were leading up to
the closed garage."
176,Rachel, Did-did you come up here to work on that term paper or something?
178,Rachel," Well, why do y’know go in that room (points to the room Ross is in)
and do your homework?"
180,Rachel," That’s your, that’s your dad’s bedroom. (Yelling)
That’s your dad’s bedroom!"
182,Rachel," Whoa, that Diet Coke just went straight to my head! Woo!"
184,Monica," Hi, honey."
185,Chandler, (gets up) See you later. (Starts to leave.)
186,Monica," What? I-I bought groceries, I was gonna make you dinner!"
187,Chandler," (angrily) Well next time ask! Or at least wait for me to ask! (He
storms out.)"
190,Monica, Oh no!
192,Monica," Oh please, he didn’t hear it! He didn’t hear it!!"
193,Chandler," (on machine) This is Chandler Bing! This is Chandler Bing! (The
machine beeps off.)"
194,Monica, NOOOO!!!!!!!!
197,Joey," Uh yeah, where-where’s the guy who decides who’s pictures go up
on the wall?"
199,Joey," Oh, you’re kidding me! All-all right, well make sure you tell him
that Joey Tribbiani stopped by to drop off all of these clothes. Okay? I’m an actor;
I’m kinda getting my picture up there on the wall."
201,Joey," Oh really? Well, maybe you and I go out for drinks? (Pause) You’re
the other one right? (She thinks about it for a second and nods yes.)"
207,Rachel," Really? Okay. Okay, I-I’ll go upstairs. (to Paul) If-if you get me
something from the car."
209,Rachel, Surprise me.
211,Rachel," (yelling) So you’re gonna be in the car, I will be upstairs, and
that’s where everybody’s gonna be!"
216,Monica, Phoebe!
217,Phoebe, Yeah?
218,Monica, Have you seen Chandler?!
219,Phoebe, No! Why?
220,Monica," The woman from the museum called and said that there was a cancellation
and that we could move up our wedding and Chandler heard! (Phoebe gasps.) I know! How bad
is this?!"
221,Phoebe," Well for the regular guy, it’s bad, but Chandler, Oh dear God!"
222,Monica," I know! I know! And he totally freaked out and I can’t find him
anywhere!"
223,Phoebe, What are you gonna do?
224,Monica," Well, I’m never gonna listen to you again, that’s for sure!
(Mimicking her.) ""Y’know, harm can it do if you go and put your name down?"""
225,Phoebe, Rachel said that!
226,Monica, Well Rachel’s not here! (Runs out.)
228,Phoebe," Oh! Here it is! (Noticing it next to the door.) Ooh, Joey! Why did you
sign it, ""Son of a bitch?"" (Son of a bitch is written across the entire
picture.)"
229,Joey, I didn’t do that! Who would’ve done that?!
231,Phoebe," Okay, maybe ask this guy."
233,Phoebe," Well, what did he do?"
235,Phoebe, Joey!
236,Joey," Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, I-I—Hey! I did not go out with your wife!
(The same woman from before enters.) Okay? I went out with her! (Points at her.)"
238,Phoebe," Well, we should go."
239,Joey, Yeah.
242,Ross," Elizabeth! (He opens one of the bed stands that he has curled himself up
into.) Okay. Okay. (She helps him out.) I’m gonna go out this window. (Points to the
window next to him.) I’ll meet you at the front door. Just tell them you’re
going home, okay?"
244,Rachel," (yelling from the living room) Oh wait-wait-wait!! No! Don’t go in
there! Don’t go in there! I need another soda!"
247,Rachel, Oh my God Ross! What in heaven’s name are you doing here?
248,Ross, (to Elizabeth) And that is why we cannot see each other anymore.
254,Ross," Okay, please-please Paul, just let me explain…"
256,Ross," All right, fine! Fine! Have me fired! But uh, I want you to know that you
and I are not all that different. I mean, I too am a neat guy. (Paul just looks at him.)"
258,Ross," And I too am just a love machine. (Hums a little bit and mimics
Paul’s flexing.)"
261,Monica," (going over to him) I’m so sorry. Please, stop freaking out."
262,Chandler," I’m not freaking out. Why would I be freaking out? A woman named
Heldi called and said we were getting married, but that happens everyday. (Does one of
those Chandler noises.)"
263,Monica," Honey, we were at this beautiful place, and I-I-I just put our names
down for fun! I mean, what’s the harm in that?"
264,Chandler, Right here! (Clucks like a chicken for some reason.)
265,Monica," Chandler, please don’t think I was trying to pressure you. Phoebe
and Rachel…"
266,Chandler," Phoebe and Rachel! So the people that knew about our wedding before me
were you, Phoebe and Rachel, Heldi, and apparently some band called Starlight Magic 7 who
are available by the way!"
267,Monica," It was a mistake. Please don’t take this to mean anything, because
it doesn’t."
268,Chandler, Okay.
269,Monica, Really?
270,Chandler," Yes, if it really doesn’t mean anything, because you know that
I’m just not ready…"
271,Monica, I know! I know.
272,Chandler, Okay. (They hug.)
273,Monica," I’m gonna go tell Joey that (laughs) that you’re back. I was
really worried about you. (Exits.)"
274,Phoebe," (entering from her room) Hey, did she buy it?"
275,Chandler, Totally.
276,Phoebe, So did Heldi show you the place?
277,Chandler," Yeah, it’s beautiful."
278,Phoebe, I can’t believe you’re gonna ask Monica to marry you!
279,Chandler, I know.
283,Joey, Hey Gunther.
285,Joey," Oh uh, well I just came in for a cup of coffee to go."
287,Joey," No! No, I quit a long time ago. (Pause) Did I forget to you that one?
I’m sorry."
289,Joey, Great! (Takes his coffee and leaves.)
0,Chandler," Pheebs, can you help me pick out an engagement ring for Monica? I
can’t figure this out! It’s so hard! Should I get her a (turning to each page)
Tiffany cut or a Princess cut or a—ah-ah! Paper cut!"
1,Phoebe," Now, have you told anyone else?"
2,Chandler," No, I don’t want to tell anybody else because I don’t want
Monica to find out."
3,Phoebe, You told me.
4,Chandler," Well, it’s because I trust you, you’re one of my best
friends, and you walked in on me when I was looking at ring brochures."
5,Phoebe," Yeah well, once again not knocking pays off. I only wish you hadn’t
been on the toilet."
6,Chandler, Me too.
8,Joey, Hey. (Heads straight for the fridge.)
9,Chandler, Hey.
10,Phoebe," Hey! So Chandler, wanna go to the coffeehouse? "
11,Chandler, Oh all right.
12,Phoebe," Yeah, coffeehouse."
13,Ross," Oh perfect, we were just gonna see if you wanted to go."
14,Chandler," Oh well, we don’t because we got…the…other pl-place."
16,Ross, How rude.
17,Joey," Oh, I’m sorry. You wanna bite? (Holds his piece out for him.)"
20,Phoebe, So how are things going with Paul?
21,Rachel," Good. Although y’know, he-he’s a private guy. Y’know, I
wish I could get him to open up a little bit, share some feelings."
22,Phoebe," That’s easy! You just have to think of him as a-as a jar of pickles
that won’t open."
23,Rachel," So what are you saying; I should run him under hot water and bang his
head against a table?"
24,Phoebe," No that’s what you do when you want to get the truth out of
someone."
26,Rachel, Hi!
27,Phoebe, (To Rachel) Watch this.
29,Rachel, (To Phoebe) Okay.
30,Phoebe, Hi Paul!
32,Phoebe, So how are things going with you?
36,Rachel, Okay. (Gets up and starts to leave with Paul.)
38,Ross, Hi!
41,Ross, Great to see you!
43,Ross, How you doing?
45,Ross, Okay! You take care! 
47,Ross," Hey Pheebs, what-what was the deal with you and Chandler blowing us off
before?"
48,Phoebe," Yeah! That was so weird, huh?"
49,Ross," Phoebe, why’d you do it?"
50,Phoebe," I didn’t do it! It was Chandler! He’s… He’s mad at
you!"
51,Ross, What?! Why?!
52,Phoebe," Please, I think you know why."
53,Ross, I can’t think of anything.
54,Phoebe," Come on Ross, you’re a paleontologist, dig a little deeper."
55,Ross," Wait a minute, is it because Joey and I didn’t invite him to that
Knicks game a couple of weeks ago?"
56,Phoebe, Do you think that’s something that he’d be mad at you for?
57,Ross, I guess it could.
58,Phoebe, Well then I think that’s it.
59,Ross," Well, if he’s angry, he really shouldn’t just cover it up. I-I
wish he would just tell me the truth."
60,Phoebe," Oh, if that’s what you want you then you really should run his head
under hot water and bang his head against a table."
63,Rachel," Yeah that’s great. But first, wait, talk to me, talk to me. Tell me
about your day."
65,Rachel," Okay. Hey, what are you thinking? What are you thinking right now?"
67,Rachel," Yeah that’s great Paul, but y’know I wanna know
what—(Puts her hands on his shoulders)—Wow, those are really great! I just wanna
know what, what is behind this-this strong, silent exterior. Y’know they say that
still waters run deep and I wanna swim in yours."
69,Rachel," No Paul, I don’t know anything about you! Y’know, like-like
your childhood! Tell me about your childhood!"
71,Rachel," Okay, well then how about puberty! Come on, that’s always a painful
time! Y’know your friends invite you to a slumber party and then they stick your hand
in warm water while you’re sleeping so that you pee in your sleeping bag."
73,Rachel," Well, you’re lucky you never met that bitch Sharon Majesky. Anyway,
umm… The rest of you life, y’know? Any regrets?"
75,Rachel," All right Paul, I’m not asking for a lot here. Okay? Just give me
something. Anything!"
77,Rachel, Okay.
79,Rachel, All right.
81,Rachel, Hm-mmm.
83,Rachel," That’s-that’s great! See? I already feel like I know you a
little better! Thank you. Okay, come on. Now we can go eat. Let’s go. (Gets up to
leave, but Paul doesn’t move.)"
85,Rachel, Oh!
88,Rachel," Yeah. Yeah, I-I-I see the scare. Listen, Paul, I think this is really
great that-that y’know, you shared your feelings. It’s really, it’s
beautiful, but umm, what do you say we go share some food?"
90,Rachel," What?! Wait! What are you talking about?! You love their Kung Pao
Chicken!"
92,Rachel," My God, I’m sorry! I’m sorry! I didn’t mean to do that! I
wouldn’t do that!"
95,Chandler," Nothin! This is the nine millionth ring store we’ve been too and
I can’t find the perfect ring! (Goes over to another display counter and starts
pointing at rings.) Ugly ring! Ugly ring! Ugly ring! (Notices that one of the jewelers is
watching him.) It’s a beautiful selection. (The jeweler walks away slowly.)"
96,Phoebe," Okay, so maybe you don’t get her a ring. Maybe you-maybe you do
something different. Y’know? Maybe you get her an engagement bracelet, y’know?
Or an engagement tiara? Or—ooh! An engagement Revolutionary War musket! (Picks one up
from the display in the corner."
97,Chandler," Y’know, I’m so glad I picked you to help me with this."
98,Phoebe," Huh? Can you just imagine getting down on one knee and handing her this
gorgeous piece of weaponry?"
99,Chandler," Yeah, I’m gonna stick with the ring. (Goes to another display
counter.) Oh, this one’s nice! (Pointing to another ring.) I like this one! Sir? Uh,
kind sir? Can I see this one?"
100,Phoebe," (coming over after returning the musket) Wait a minute, no, this is,
this is the reason you brought me. Okay? I know how to haggle. So let me handle this from
here on out."
102,Chandler," Uh-uh, yes. I would like to see that ring please."
103,Phoebe," Or not, whatever."
105,Chandler," Sir, can I ask you to umm, could you…hold out that ring and ask
me to marry you?"
107,Chandler," (choking up) Oh my God that’s it, that’s the ring! How much
is it?"
108,Phoebe," Chandler, I-I will handle this! (To the jeweler) How much is it?"
110,Phoebe, We will give you $10.
112,Chandler," Yes! Yes, but I can only pay $8,000."
114,Phoebe, We stand firm at $10.
116,Chandler," Uh, credit card. (Reaches for it then realizes) Oh no! No-no, but I
left my credit card with Joey. (To Phoebe) Okay, I’ll go get it. You guard the ring."
117,Phoebe," Okay. (To the jeweler) Listen, I’m sorry about before. Do you have
anything her for $10."
119,Phoebe, I’ll give you $1 for them.
121,Ross," Hey, remember how Chandler and Phoebe blew us off yesterday?"
122,Joey, No.
123,Ross, Remember? You-you were eating pizza.
124,Joey, Yeah.
125,Ross," Okay. Well, apparently Chandler’s angry at us for not getting him a
ticket to that Knicks game a couple of weeks ago."
126,Joey," Oh, we’re supposed to just get him a ticket?! That guy is always
mooching off of us!"
127,Ross," Yeah! Anyway, I-I still think we should try to patch things up,
y’know? Like uh, maybe we could get him to get tickets to another Knicks game and
invite him."
128,Joey, Oh wow that’s a great idea! And I still have his credit card.
130,Ross, Oh. (Starts to get his money) 
131,Joey," Hey-hey-hey-ho-ho, I got this one. Here you go. (Hands Gunther
Chandler’s card.) Y’know I gotta tell ya, sometimes I just—I don’t get
Chandler. Y’know, me and him do stuff all the time without you and you don’t get
all upset."
132,Ross, All the time?
133,Joey, All the time!
135,Rachel, Oh my God! Oh my God!!
136,Monica, Still crying?
137,Rachel," Like a little girl. I know. I know. I know. This is all my fault;
I wanted him to open up. But God, I didn’t know that I was gonna unleash this-this
weepy, clingy, moist monster!"
138,Monica," Y’know, I only know of two surefire ways to shut a man up. And one
of them is sex."
139,Rachel, What’s the other one?
140,Monica," I don’t know, I’ve never had to use the other one. I’m
just saying y’know, if we’re having sex, he’s not gonna be talking."
141,Rachel," Oh that’s right. You’re the talker. (They both reflect on that
briefly) Anyway uh, great idea! Umm, I gotta go to the store; I told him that I would buy
him some more tissues."
142,Monica," Oh, we have some…"
143,Rachel, No you don’t!
145,Phoebe," Okay umm, I’d also like to try on the tiara. (The male jeweler
hands it to her.) Oh yeah. Okay. (Puts it on.) (To the jeweler) What do you think, too
much?"
147,Phoebe," Okay. Then, take the tiara back and let me hold the musket again. (He
hands it to her and Phoebe poses in front of one of those small mirrors.) Something’s
missing. It’s not… Okay oh, let me see the ring my friend picked out."
150,Phoebe," Oh my God!! (She runs after him, but sets of the security system, which
locks the store’s door and brings down a set of bars behind her, caging her in.) No!
What?! Help me! Let me out! Now! (Points the musket at them.)"
154,Chandler, No. How are ya Paul? (Starts to look for his credit card.)
156,Chandler," No, did he hug you?!"
158,Chandler," Well, you can see my dad in Vegas kissing other dads."
160,Chandler, Yeah?
162,Chandler, I’m a little busy here Paul.
164,Chandler," Okay, a quick one. Come on hug it out. (Paul rushes over and hugs
Chandler tightly.) Oh hey! There you go. (The hug continues.) Okay. (The hug continues.)"
166,Chandler, Okay! (Pushes him away.)
167,Joey, (entering) Hey!
169,Joey," Whoa-whoa-hey-hey! (Motions to Chandler, ""What’s going
on?"") Hi, Paul is it? (Paul nods yes and still hugging Joey.)"
170,Chandler, Do you have my credit card?
171,Joey," Yes, it’s in my… In…in my pocket. (Paul hasn’t dropped
him yet.) (Chandler starts to reach for his front pocket.) My back pocket! My back pocket!"
172,Chandler, Thank God! (Grabs his card.)
173,Joey, Oh hey listen I got us tickets to a Knicks game tonight.
174,Chandler," Oh, I can’t go."
175,Joey," Come on! It’ll be fun! Me, you, and Ross, and… Paul
probably…"
177,Phoebe," Chandler, I found the perfect ring. (Holding it out for her.)"
178,Chandler," Oh, that’s uh, that’s pretty nice but I’m gonna go with
the one I picked first."
179,Phoebe," Oh my God Chandler, the one you picked is gone. It’s over!"
180,Chandler, What?
181,Phoebe," Some guy bought it. I’m sorry. I tired to stop it but they (points
to the jeweler) put me in jail!"
182,Chandler, They put you in jail?
183,Phoebe, The little jail between the doors!
184,Chandler," Phoebe, I asked you to guard the ring!"
185,Phoebe," I know, I’m sorry! But y’know, this ring is better! Monica
never even saw the other ring."
186,Chandler, Yeah but when he proposed to me with the ring I got goose bumps.
187,Phoebe, Maybe it was the guy.
188,Chandler, It was the ring!
190,Ross," Hey! So uh, was he excited about the tickets?"
191,Joey, No! He blew us off!
192,Ross, What?!
193,Joey, I know!
194,Ross," I can’t believe it. (Pause) Can I tell you something? I’m a
little mad at him now."
195,Joey, Can I tell you something? Me too.
196,Ross," Y’know what? He didn’t want to talk to us about being angry,
well maybe we don’t talk to him at all!"
197,Joey, Ooooh! Freeze him out.
198,Ross, That’s right!
199,Joey, I like it!
200,Ross, Eh? We’ll show him!
201,Joey," From now on, it’s gonna be Joey and Ross, best friends. (They shake
hands.) Okay! We’re gonna be the new Joey and Chandler."
203,Rachel, Hi. I’m back.
205,Rachel," Ah that’s great. No actually that’s… (In a sexy voice)
That’s great! That’s really great! Y’know, I gotta tell ya writing, I mean
writing, gets me uh, gets me kinda hot."
207,Rachel, A lover?
209,Rachel, Oh yeah surfer?
211,Rachel," Okay, hold on real quick, hold on a second let me just uh, (sits on the
counter and buttons her sweater to show some cleavage) get a little more comfortable here.
Wait, now wait a second, this isn’t too revealing is it?"
213,Rachel," I don’t care about the little dude! I can’t! I cannot listen
to anymore of this! Y’know, the only person who would want to listen to this is a
mental health professional! And then it’s only because they get paid $100 an hour! Do
you know how much money I could’ve made listening to you? $2,000! And do you know
when I figured that out? While you were talking!"
215,Rachel," Oh… I’m sorry. I… I-I don’t mean—I didn’t
mean to stifle you. I… This is all just a little overwhelming."
217,Rachel," I’m so glad, I’m so glad you shared. (Feeling his shoulder.)
And I’m glad that you’re done. What do you say we umm… (Nods in the
direction of the bedroom.)"
222,Phoebe, (entering from her room) Hey.
223,Chandler," I can’t believe I let you talk me into buying this stupid gumball
machine looking ring!"
224,Phoebe," It’s not a stupid gumball machine looking ring! It’s a
beautiful ring!"
225,Chandler," No, it’s not! When I looked at the other ring I could see
Monica’s face when I gave it to her, y’know? And I could see her saying yes.
When I look at this ring, all I see is a ring! Unless I look at it really closely and then
I can see my own eye. (Does so and laughs.) Look, this is the most important thing
I’m gonna do in my life. I wanna make sure it’s perfect."
226,Phoebe," Okay. There may be a way that we can get the other ring back.
‘Cause I heard the guy tell the jeweler where he was going to propose. So maybe we
can get him to trade rings or something."
227,Chandler, I can’t do that.
228,Phoebe, Well you certainly can’t give her that stupid gumball ring.
230,Phoebe, There he is! (Points.)
231,Chandler," Okay and he hasn’t proposed yet because she has no ring on her
finger."
232,Phoebe," Wow! You’re good! After this, we should solve crimes."
233,Chandler," Yeah! Okay, go, go, go get him."
234,Phoebe," Oh, okay. (Walks over to him.) Excuse me sir? Could you come with me
please? You have a phone call."
236,Phoebe, It is your office.
238,Phoebe, John?
241,Phoebe, (To Chandler) Here he is.
242,Chandler," (to him) Hi! Hi. Okay, there was a slight mix-up at the jewelry store,
the ring you’re about to propose with was supposed to be held for me. So, I’m
gonna need to have that back. (The guy isn’t sure.) But, in exchange I’m willing
to trade you this beautiful, more expensive ring. (Looking at the ring.) Ew."
243,Phoebe, Wow! I would trade.
245,Chandler," No-no! This is my fiancee (Phoebe) and her heart was set on that ring.
You don’t want to break her heart now do you?"
246,Phoebe," Yeah, do you want to break a dying woman’s heart?"
249,Chandler," Yeah, she’s dying… Of a cough apparently."
250,Phoebe," Yes, and it is my dying wish to have that ring. See, if I’m not
buried with that ring then my spirit is going to wander the nether world for all
eternity…"
251,Chandler," (interrupting her) Okay, that’s enough honey!"
253,Chandler," Great! Okay, here. (Holds the ring up for him.)"
255,Chandler," Thank you. Thank you. Thank you! (To his girlfriend) And you
are about to marry a wonderful man! (She stunned and he’s horrified.) Hey! I’m
marrying a dead woman!"
257,Chandler," Guys? (They ignore him.) I’ve got something important to tell ya.
(Still nothing so he walks over and stands in front of the TV.) Guys? (They lean over to
try and watch the TV, Chandler mimics them.) Guys?! (Pause) I’m gonna ask Monica to
marry me."
258,Joey, (To Ross) I think we gotta end the freeze out.
259,Ross," Wait a minute, is this, is this for real?"
260,Chandler," Yeah, check out the ring. (Shows it to them.)"
261,Joey, Oh my God!!
262,Ross, So you two are really serious?!
263,Chandler," Yep, pretty much."
264,Ross," You-you’re gonna get married?! I mean… We’re gonna be
brothers-in-law! (They hug.)"
265,Joey," And-and-and-and-and-and, and we’re gonna be friends again! "
266,Chandler, (goes to hug him and stops short) Heyyyy—What?
267,Joey," Oh it’s water under the bridge, forget it!"
268,Chandler," Okay! (They hug.) I was gonna wait ‘til uh, it was official
y’know? But I got so excited I just had to tell you guys because you’re my best
friends."
269,Joey, I think I’m gonna cry!
270,Rachel," (who has just entered) Ugh! No more crying! Please! I just dumped one
cry baby, I’ll dump you too!"
272,Chandler, I’m gonna ask Monica to marry me.
273,Rachel," Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh Chandler!! (Hugs him.) You guys are gonna be so
happy!"
274,Chandler, I know.
275,Joey," (holding an empty tissue box) Where’s all the tissues?! (Throws the
box down in disgust.)"
278,Chandler, Check out the ring.
279,Rachel, (gasps) Nice! One and a half carat easy.
280,Phoebe, (entering) Hi.
281,Ross, Hey-hey Pheebs!
282,Phoebe, What?
283,Ross, Chandler’s gonna ask Monica to marry him!
284,Phoebe," Oh I know, I helped pick out the ring."
286,Ross, You told her before you told us?
287,Chandler," Well, she walked in when I was looking at the ring brochures. You can
understand that, right? (Ross and Joey look at each other and go back to watching the game
on TV.) Guys? Guys? (Walks in front of them again.)"
0,Ross, God that is the most beautiful engagement ring ever!
1,Rachel," Yeah? Well, you should know. You’ve bought like a billion of
‘em."
2,Ross," Yeah, you didn’t get one."
3,Chandler," Okay, well tonight’s the big night."
4,Phoebe, Yeah!
5,Joey," Okay listen, how are you gonna ask her?"
6,Chandler," It is going to be perfect. I am taking her to her favorite restaurant.
I’m going to get her a bottle of the champagne that she really loves; therefore knows
how expensive it is. Then when the glasses are full, instead of proposing a toast I’m
just gonna propose."
7,Rachel, Ohh…
8,Joey, That sounds perfect!
9,Chandler, Yeah.
10,Joey, You’re gonna mess it up let me do it.
11,Chandler, I’m not gonna mess it up.
12,Phoebe," If she says no, can I have the ring?"
13,Chandler, She’s not gonna say no.
14,Phoebe, If!
15,Monica, (entering) Hey!
16,Ross, Hey!
18,Chandler, Hey!
19,Phoebe, (with her mouthful) Hi Monica.
21,Chandler, (To Phoebe) Give me it!
22,Phoebe, It’s gone.
23,Chandler, Phoebe!
25,Joey, Hey!
26,Chandler, (with his mouthful) Hi Monica.
28,Phoebe," (To Chandler) We’re practically kissing. (Makes a kissy face and
winks at him.)"
31,Rachel, (entering) Hey!
32,Chandler, Hey!
33,Joey, Hey Rach!
34,Rachel," Are any of you guys free tonight? My boss is hosting this charity event
for underprivileged kids and the more people I bring, the better I look. So, Monica?
Chandler?"
35,Chandler," (glaring at her) Well, Monica and Chandler can’t go. We’re
going to dinner remember?!"
36,Rachel," Oh my God, I’m so sorry."
37,Monica, What’s the big deal?
38,Chandler," I just get mad when Rachel doesn’t remember where we’re
going."
39,Joey, Where are you going?
41,Rachel, How about you guys? (Points to Phoebe and Joey.)
42,Phoebe, Open bar?
43,Rachel, I think so.
44,Phoebe, I can do that for the kids.
45,Joey," Hey, y’know what? I’ll come too. I’m making money now;
it’s about time I give something back."
46,Chandler," Well, you could also give back the money you owe me."
47,Joey, Okay. Have a benefit.
48,Ross, (entering) Hey!
49,Rachel," Hey! Ross, listen can you come to a charity event tonight?"
50,Ross," Oh no, I have plans with Elizabeth."
51,Chandler," Oh, so you’re already doing your part for the kids."
52,Ross," I’m sorry, it’s just one of my last nights together before she
leaves for camp—to be a counselor!"
53,Monica," Ross let me ask you a question. All jokes aside, where is this
relationship going?"
54,Chandler," Wait a minute, all jokes aside? I didn’t agree to that!"
55,Monica, Do you really see this as a long-term thing?
56,Ross, I don’t know.
57,Phoebe," Y’know, you are 12 years older than her."
58,Ross," Wait a minute, does-does everyone feel this way?"
60,Ross," Uh-uh—Wow! Uh, I thought you guys were just like making jokes, I had
no idea. What you know what? You guys are wrong. Uh yes, there is a chronological age
difference but I never notice it. You know why? Because she is very mature. Besides, it
doesn’t really matter to me what you guys think. I mean, I’m the one dating
Elizabeth, not you!"
61,Joey, That’s not what she said last night. (Ross glares at him.)
62,Rachel," See? Now, he could date her."
64,Chandler," Will you marry me? Will you marry me? (Makes like a gun with
his fingers.) Hey, you marry me! (He gives up as Joey, Rachel, Phoebe, and Ross slink in
all excited.) What’s going on little elves?"
65,Joey, It’s the big night! We wanted to wish you good luck!
66,Ross," Yeah, yeah you have the ring?"
67,Chandler," Yeah, right here in my pocket. (Pats his pocket. Phoebe smiles, goes
over to hug him, and removes the ring from his pocket.) Pheebs?"
68,Phoebe, Oh! Oop! (Hands him back the ring.)
69,Chandler," Okay, now will you guys get out of here? I want this is to be a
surprise and she’s gonna know."
70,Ross, (to the rest of them) Yeah-yeah you guys. Get out of here!
72,Monica, Hi guys.
73,Chandler, (To Monica) You are beautiful.
74,Monica," Oh, thank you! (The gang exhibits signs of quiet apprehension and wears
knowing glances.) (Monica giggles.) What’s going on?"
75,Rachel," (breaking up) We’re just really…very excited about this
charity event that we have to go to."
77,Phoebe, Here.
78,Rachel, Oh! Thank you!
79,Phoebe, So now what’s going on here?
80,Rachel," Uh well, uh this is a silent auction. They lay out all the stuff here
and then you write down your offer and then the highest bid gets it."
81,Phoebe," No, I know what a silent is I meant, what’s going on with your
hair?"
82,Rachel," (suddenly worried) Uh, wh-why?"
83,Phoebe, No! It’s nice!
86,Rachel," Oh, hi!"
88,Rachel," Someone? I brought people. Mr. Thompson, this is Phoebe. Phoebe, this is
Mr. Thompson. (She introduces them.) He’s the head of my department."
89,Phoebe," Oh, hi. (They shake hands.)"
90,Rachel, And I also brought my friend Joey…
91,Joey," (behind them) Oh!! Shrimp toast! (Walks right past the little group on his
way for the shrimp toast.)"
92,Rachel," Well, y’know I-I don’t know where he is."
94,Rachel," Well, y’know what? Actually, I was about to bid on this lovely trip
to Paris."
96,Rachel, Yeah.
98,Rachel," Thank you. (Mr. Thompson walks away and after he’s left.) Okay,
(writing her bid down) twenty dollars."
102,Ross, What’s-what’s going on?
104,Ross," Oh, you have to call the police! That’s what I did to the kids in my
building!"
106,Ross," Oh! (Does a laugh/groan.) Listen umm, I, I just stopped by to see if you
wanted to see this play tonight. Umm, it’s supposed to be excellent. The director is
the same…"
110,Ross," No! Okay! Okay! (Stops her.) Okay, look, can I, can I just-just talk to
you for a second?"
112,Ross," Uh, so this play umm, what do you think? It’s-it’s gotten great
reviews! Y’know the uh…"
120,Ross," (screaming) Everybody put their balloons down!!! (There is a
temporary cease fire.) Now this is a nice suit!! (Shows everyone where he was hit.)"
123,Rachel, Ugh! So close!
125,Phoebe, Hey you guys! Look! 
126,Joey, Hey!
127,Phoebe, I got me some drinks!
128,Rachel, What are you doing?
129,Phoebe, Open bar!
130,Rachel, Well now it’s an empty bar.
131,Phoebe," You just can’t stand anyone else enjoying themselves can’t
you?"
133,Joey, I won! That was my guess!
134,Rachel, What?! What?! What?!
135,Joey," I guessed 20,000!"
136,Rachel," Joey! It is an auction! You don’t guess, you buy!"
137,Joey," What?! I don’t have 20,000!"
140,Rachel, Joey! Sit down! (Pulls him down.)
141,Phoebe," Forget her! You enjoy this!! (Pulls him back up and starts applauding
again. Joey waves and does a salute.] "
143,Monica, What are you doing?
144,Chandler," (trying to cover up why his hand is over his heart) One nation, under
God. Indivisible with liberty and justice for all. (Laughs.) I remembered it. (It’s a
butchered version of the Pledge of Allegiance of the United States for our foreign
friends.) The champagne is here. (The waiter is delivering it and pouring two glasses.) "
145,Monica, Are you okay?
146,Chandler," Yes! Yes! I’m good! Are you good? Are you good? Is
everything—are you—are you perrr-perfect?!"
147,Monica," Yeah. I’m okay. I’m actually—I’m a little cold, can
I have your jacket?"
148,Chandler," Oh, yeah. (Starts to take it off and then realizes) Uh, no you
can’t have my jacket! Because then I would be cold! If you thought that you were
going to be cold, you should’ve brought your own jacket. But uh, other than that, are
you okay? Are you okay?"
149,Monica, (laughs) Are you sure you’re okay?
150,Chandler," Yes! I’m fine. In fact I’ve been fine for a long time now
and I think, the reason is you."
151,Monica, Ohh that’s sweet!
152,Chandler," Okay umm, before I meant you I had really little life and I
couldn’t imagine growing old with…"
154,Monica, (interrupting him) Oh my God!
155,Chandler," (not knowing the true meaning of her exclamation) I know, but just let
me say it."
156,Monica," Oh my God, Richard. (Yep, Richard’s back.)"
157,Chandler," What?! I’m Chandler! (She nods towards the doorway, Chandler
turns and looks) Oh, that’s Richard!"
158,Monica," Oh God, maybe he won’t see us. Richard!"
161,Chandler," Hey-hey, hey! (Gets up and hugs him.) I don’t know why I did
that!"
162,Monica," Hey, it’s good to see you!"
164,Monica," Yeah—Oh that’s right. You, you always wanted me too. Hey, I
see you got your mustache back."
166,Chandler," (to Richard’s date) And uh, you don’t have a mustache which
is good. (She just smiles.) I’m Chandler; I make jokes when I’m uncomfortable."
168,Chandler, Hi.
170,Chandler," Richard! No one supposed to know about us! (Richard just smiles at
him.) See I, did it again."
171,Monica," Chandler, wh-why don’t we sit down?"
172,Chandler," Yeah, I’ll sit down. (He slides back into his chair.)"
173,Monica, (to Richard) It’s good to see you
176,Chandler, Yes. (Thinking he’s gone.)
181,Rachel, What were you thinking?!
182,Joey, I didn’t know it was an auction!
183,Rachel, Wh?!
184,Joey," I figured, take a guess, help a charity, free boat!"
185,Rachel, Why would a charity give away a free boat?!
186,Joey, I don’t know! Charity?
187,Rachel, Ugh!
188,Phoebe," Well, just buy the damn boat! (She’s still working her way through
her tray of booze.)"
189,Rachel," Phoebe, don’t you think you’ve had enough to drink?"
190,Phoebe, I’m just helping the kids!
191,Rachel, How is you drinking helping the kids?
192,Phoebe," Because the more I drink, the less there is for the kids to drink."
194,Joey, Oh hi!
196,Joey," Just out of curiosity, how-how much is that boat worth?"
198,Joey," (To Rachel) Hey, I was pretty close. (She just glares at him.) Uhh, so bad
news. Umm, I can’t buy the boat, I don’t have any money."
200,Rachel," Joey! Joey, good one! (Mr. Thompson starts to laugh.)"
203,Joey," So uh listen, I think I’m gonna take off now. (Starts to get up.)"
204,Rachel," (stopping him) Hey! You…can’t…leave Joey! You agreed to
buy that boat, all right?! That is a contract! And plus if you leave, my boss is gonna
kill me!"
205,Joey," Well, what am I gonna do Rach?! I don’t have that kind of money!"
206,Rachel," I know. Okay. (Whispering and thinking.) Okay. Okay. All right. All
right, this is what we’re gonna do, we are gonna go to the next highest bidder, and
we are just gonna let them buy it, and then you’re just gonna pay the difference."
207,Joey, Okay.
208,Rachel, Okay.
209,Joey," Look, I don’t know why the kids need a youth center anyway!
Y’know? They should just watch TV after school like I did and I turned out fine!"
210,Rachel, Not great.
212,Monica," And so, we’re hiding in the bathroom."
214,Monica," So I hide in the shower and the next thing you know they’re going
at it right on the bathroom floor."
217,Chandler," I got a good one, I got a good one! I once walked in on both my
parents making love to the same guy."
220,Monica, Ohh.
221,Chandler, What?!
224,Ross," Oh my God, you guys!! (He’s excited about what he thought happened.)"
225,Chandler," (stopping him from going any further) Before you say anything, have we
got a story for you! Guess who we bumped into at dinner!"
226,Ross, Who?
227,Chandler, Richard!
228,Ross," What? (Excited) A-ohh! (Realizes) Ohh. Oh that’s right that’s
right. That’s Richard’s favorite place too."
229,Chandler, Oh you knew that. Good!
230,Monica, I thought you were going out with Elizabeth.
231,Ross," Yeah, I was but uh, she was a little busy with a water balloon fight."
232,Monica," Oh Ross, sometimes grown-ups have commitments they just can’t get
out of!"
233,Ross," Y’know, maybe she is too young for me. Y’know, when I was over
there and she was running around with her friends, I felt like I was a baby-sitter. I
finally started to see what you guys were talking about. I don’t know what to do."
234,Monica," Why don’t you just weigh out the good stuff about the relationship
against the bad stuff. I mean that’s what I did when I first (looks at Chandler and
pauses) weighing stuff."
235,Ross," Okay umm, bad stuff. Well, I’m-I’m 12 years older than she is."
236,Monica, If the school finds out you’re fired.
237,Ross, Hmm.
238,Monica, She’s leaving for three months.
239,Chandler, For camp!
240,Ross," Okay, good stuff. Umm, well she’s-she’s sweet and pretty
and…"
241,Monica," Look Ross, the only question you need to ask is, ""Do you see a
future?"" I mean like do you see yourself marrying her? (Ross pauses in
consideration.) Oh my God! You did it already! You married her, didn’t you?!"
242,Ross," No! No! I…didn’t do that. It’s just… Okay, honestly
no. I don’t, I don’t see a big future with her."
243,Monica, Okay well I think…that’s your answer.
244,Ross," I’ve got to talk to her. Ugh, I hate this part."
245,Chandler," Hey, you have to forget about Elizabeth. I mean if you’re not
careful you may not get married at all this year!"
247,Joey," Rach! Rachel! Okay, the next highest bidder is at table one."
248,Rachel, Oh great!
249,Joey, (To Phoebe) Oh and uh the guy who got the Paris trip is at table four.
250,Phoebe," Oh, okay."
251,Rachel, (To Phoebe) Why do you care about the guy who won the Paris trip?
252,Phoebe," It’s a trip for two! (She gets up and takes off her blouse-type
thingy she’s wearing over her dress.) Excuse me. (She walks over to table four.)
Excuse me, is the person who won the Paris trip at this table?"
254,Phoebe," Oh, en chante. (She holds out her hand for him to kiss it, but he only
shakes it.) "
257,Joey," Uhh, excuse me is there a Mr. Bowmont at this table?"
259,Joey," Ahh, yes. (Pushes Rachel in front of himself so that she could do the
talking.)"
260,Rachel," Oh well, hello. This is your lucky day Mr. Bowmont, the uh gentleman day
sailer as just become available again and I believe that you made a bid of $18,000."
261,Joey, You-you have to pay that! It’s not just a guess.
262,Rachel, (To Joey) Okay. Okay. (Shushes him.)
264,Rachel, Ohh…
265,Joey, Are you kidding me?! She’s gonna this boat!
266,Rachel, Y-Yeah! What-what is your wife’s name?
268,Rachel," Pam! Oh God okay, just imagine this, ""The Pam."""
269,Joey, Aw-awww!
271,Rachel," Okay, uh-uh imagine this, ""The Mr. Bowmont."""
272,Joey, Oooooh…
274,Rachel," Okay look, let me paint you a little picture. (She sits down next to
him.) All right, you are settin’ sail up the Hudson! You’ve got the wind in your
h—(sees that he’s bald)—arms! You-you get all that peace and quiet that
you’ve always wanted! You get back to nature! You can go fishin’! You
can—ooh, you can get one of those little hats and have people call you captain, and
then when you’re old, Cappy."
276,Joey, No way! It’s mine!!
277,Rachel, (To Joey) What?! What?!
278,Joey, All that stuff you just said? I want that!
279,Rachel," But Joey you don’t have $20,000!"
280,Joey," Who cares?! I-I’ll make payments, whatever it takes, I want the Mr.
Bowmont!!"
282,Joey," Oh my God, you’re back!"
283,Phoebe," Ohh, let me see it! Let me see your hand! (Chandler is frantically
trying to wave them off.)"
284,Monica, Why do you want to see my hand?
285,Phoebe, I wanna see what’s in your hand. I wanna see the trash. 
286,Joey, Yeah.
288,Phoebe," Eww! Oh, it’s all dirty. You should throw this out."
289,Monica, (suspiciously) Okay. (Exits to carry out Phoebe’s wishes.)
290,Chandler, (after the door closes) What did you guys just do?!
291,Phoebe, What happened?
292,Chandler, Richard was there so I couldn’t do it!
293,Joey, What?! Noooo… (Phoebe gasps.)
294,Chandler," I’m gonna do it tomorrow y’know, and-and surprise her, but
now you’ve ruined it!"
295,Joey, We didn’t ruin it!
296,Chandler, Who walks into a room and asks to see a person’s hands?!
297,Phoebe," Well, a palm reader, a manicurist, a hand doctor…"
298,Joey, Glove salesman!
299,Phoebe, Good one! Yeah.
300,Chandler, This is terrible. What am I going to do?
301,Phoebe," Look, she only suspects something okay? She doesn’t know for sure,
so just throw her off the track."
302,Chandler," That’s right, I can throw her off. I can make her think marriage
is the last thing on my mind."
303,Phoebe," Yeah! Yeah! Convince her that-that you’re scared of commitment!
Convince her that you’re a little coward!"
304,Chandler," I can do that, I’ve had 30 years of practice."
305,Joey," Hey, being you is finally gonna pay off! (They give each other fives.)"
306,Monica," (entering) I had to go all the way to the basement because some idiot
keeps stuffing the trash chute with pizza boxes!"
307,Joey, That guy’s still doing that?!
308,Rachel," (entering) Hey! (Sees Monica, gasps, and runs over to her.) Oh my God
you’re here, let me see your hand!!"
309,Phoebe," No, you’re too late!!! She already took out the trash!!!"
311,Ross," (in his head) Wow! I have never had such a healthy break-up! She was
such a grown-up about it! She didn’t seem too immature for me! Did I just make a huge
mistake?"
313,Ross," Elizabeth, thank God! I was just thinking about…"
315,Ross, What?!
317,Ross," Okay, break-up’s still on!"
319,Chandler," Okay, okay, here she comes! (Sits on the couch next to him.) How do I
look? Do I look like a guy who doesn’t want to get married?"
320,Joey," Yeah! And also, a little like a French guy. (They both squint at each
other.) I never noticed that before."
321,Monica, (entering) Hi guys!
322,Joey, Hey!
323,Chandler, Hey!
324,Monica, What are you up too?
325,Chandler," Oh, just hanging out, talkin’ about uh, websites. (Joey laughs.)
Yeah, we saw this really interesting website about marriage and how totally unnecessary it
is and how its just a way for the government to keep tabs on you."
326,Joey," (laughs) Yeah, Big Brother."
327,Monica," Well that’s a little crazy. Although I am y’know glad to hear
that you’re branching out on what you look at on the Internet."
328,Chandler," Yeah, well… Y’know, it just got me thinking though, why
would anybody ever want to get married huh?"
329,Monica," Why?! To celebrate your relationship! To solidify your commitment! To
declare your love for one another to the world!"
330,Chandler, Eh…
331,Monica, Okay well that’s good to know.
333,Joey," (all excited) The Mr. Bowmont’s here!!! (Jumps over the back off the
couch and runs out into the street.)"
336,Monica," Sure, I love this part! (Starts to look busy.)"
340,Monica, Richard!
342,Monica," Ohh… Oh, that’s okay I hate when people come back to
complement the chef. Like I have nothing better to do! So what’s up?"
344,Monica," Oh, good to see you too. Did you come down here to tell me that?"
348,Monica, What uh—What did you—What?!
350,Monica, Y’know you’re really not supposed to be back here!
352,Monica," Oh God… (Starts looking around.) Why don’t they put chairs
back here?!"
354,Monica," What the… Yes you’re too late! Where was all this three years
ago?!"
356,Monica, What were you doing in Africa?
358,Monica," Ohhh! What are you doing to me?! Oh look, I-I… I’m sorry but
umm, this-this-this-this is not going to happen."
360,Monica," Well he is! Yeah, I mean marriage is all he talks about! My goodness, in
fact, I’m the one that’s making him wait!"
362,Monica, Yeah!
364,Monica, Why? Because of the government.
366,Rachel," Isn’t it incredible?! Monica and Chandler, gettin’ married."
367,Phoebe," I know, they’re gonna be so happy together."
368,Rachel," Ohh… I mean two best friends falling in love, how often does that
happen?"
369,Phoebe, Not that often!
370,Rachel, No! I’m so happy for them!
371,Phoebe, Me too! So happy for them!
372,Rachel, I’m so happy and not at all jealous.
373,Phoebe," Oh no! No God, definitely not jealous!"
375,Rachel," I mean I’m probably 98% happy, maybe 2% jealous. And I mean
what’s 2%? That’s nothing."
376,Phoebe, Totally. I’m like 90/10.
377,Rachel, Yeah me too.
379,Joey," Hey uh, have you guys scene Chandler?"
380,Rachel," (staring at him) Wh—no, but y’know who did stop in here
looking for ya, Tennille."
382,Monica," So that marriage stuff that you were saying yesterday, you don’t
really believe that do you?"
383,Chandler," Sure I do. In fact, I think the whole concept of marriage is
unnatural. I mean look at pigs. Let’s take a second here and look at pigs. Okay pigs
don’t mate for life. I mean a pig can have like a hundred sexual partners in a
lifetime, and that’s just an ordinary pig not even a pig that’s good at sports!"
384,Monica," Yeah, but that’s pigs not people!"
385,Chandler," If marriage worked, I’d be all for it. But do you know what the
divorce rate in this country is? 97%."
386,Monica," Wait a minute. Are you honestly telling me that-that you may never
want to get married?"
387,Chandler," Well, never say never but y’know probably uh yeah, never."
388,Monica, Oh my God! Then-then-then what are we even doing?! What is this?!
389,Chandler," Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What is all this pressure?! Is this some new kind of
strategy? Why don’t you put down your copy of ‘The Rules’ huh mantrap?!"
390,Monica, Y’know what?! I gotta go! Ugh! 
392,Chandler," (to them) It’s okay, I got a plan."
394,Rachel, We’re gonna find love!
395,Phoebe, Definitely!
396,Rachel," Yeah, I’m pretty confident about that. That’s what makes it so
easy for me to be 80% happy for Monica and Chandler! It would be nice to have a little
guarantee though."
397,Phoebe, What do you mean?
398,Rachel," Well y’know, some people make deals with a friend, like if neither
of them are married by the time they’re 40, they marry each other."
399,Phoebe, You mean a backup?
400,Rachel, Exactly!
401,Phoebe," Yeah, yeah I got that."
402,Rachel, You do?
403,Phoebe, Hm-mmm.
404,Rachel, Who?
405,Phoebe, Joey.
406,Rachel, Joey?!
407,Phoebe, Yeah!
408,Rachel, Are you serious?!
409,Phoebe," Yeah, I locked him years ago!"
410,Rachel," Wh… So… If neither of you are married by the time you’re
40, you’re gonna marry Joey."
411,Phoebe," Yep, we shook on it. Yeah but believe me that is not how he wanted to
seal the deal."
412,Rachel," Oh, seriously?"
413,Phoebe," Ohh, yeah. I think his exact words were… (She makes two clicking
sounds with her tongue and purrs.)"
414,Rachel, Charming.
415,Phoebe," Well hey, it’s just a backup."
416,Rachel, Yeah.
418,Joey, Hey Monica!
419,Monica, Have you seen Rachel? Or a mirror?
420,Joey," This is for my boat, pretty cool huh?"
421,Monica," Yeah, it’s great."
422,Joey," Whoa-whoa, what’s the matter?! Talk to the captain!"
423,Monica," I’m just having one of those days where you realize you’re in
a dead-end relationship!"
424,Joey, Chandler giving you a hard time huh?
425,Monica," It’s not like I want to get married tomorrow! It’s just that
I-I’d like to believe that I’m in a relationship that’s actually going
somewhere, that I’m not just wasting my time!"
426,Joey," Well, you know Chandler."
427,Monica," No I don’t know Chandler! Not anymore! It’s like it’s
like something’s changed."
428,Joey, Maybe you changed?
429,Monica, I didn’t change!
430,Joey, Maybe that’s the problem.
431,Monica, What?!
432,Joey," Chandler is a complex fellow, one who is unlikely to take a wife."
433,Monica, Is that some kind of boat talk?
434,Joey," I don’t know! (All excited) I haven’t totally decided how to
talk on my boat yet."
435,Monica," What does he think? Does he think I’m just gonna wait around for
nothing?"
436,Joey," Monica face it, Chandler is against marriage. And-and always will be!"
437,Monica," (starts for the door) Well there’s some people who do want to marry
me."
438,Joey, There are?
439,Monica, Yeah! Richard!
440,Joey," R-R-Richard said he wants to marry you?! (Monica nods yes.) And-and
Chandler’s tellin’ ya how much he hates marriage?!"
441,Monica, That’s right.
442,Joey, Chandler loves marriage!!
443,Monica," You just told me that he hates marriage! That-that he’s a-a complex
fellow who’s unlikely to take a wife! That-that he’s against marriage and always
will be!"
444,Joey, You got that from what I said?!
447,Ross, What happened you guys?
449,Ross, Rach!
450,Rachel, Hey you!
451,Ross," Hey, come on in."
452,Rachel," Oh thank you. Hey y’know, I’m so sorry to hear about you and
Elizabeth."
453,Ross," Oh, thanks. Yeah, I really thought we’d be able to make it work, but
uh, I guess it just wasn’t meant to be."
454,Rachel," Yeah, love. It’s a tricky business isn’t it?"
455,Ross, I guess so.
456,Rachel," So what do you say we make a pact? If you and I are both single by the
time we’re 40, we get married. I mean, we know each other, we like each other, and
we’ve-we’ve already slept together so y’know there’ll be no surprises
there! You know what I mean? No like, ""What’s that?!"""
457,Ross, Right. Ohh! You-you want me to be your backup.
458,Rachel, Exactly.
459,Ross," Ohh, yeah I already have one."
460,Rachel, What? Who?
461,Ross, Phoebe.
462,Rachel," Phoebe?! Wait a—but-but she just, she said that Joey was her
backup."
463,Ross," Ohh, I don’t think so."
464,Rachel," Ross! I just had a conversation with her, and she said that she and Joey
made a deal!"
465,Ross," That’s impossible! I mean we have had a deal for years!
We-we-we shook on it, although believe me she wanted to do a lot more than that."
467,Joey, Where the hell have you been?!
468,Chandler, I was making a coconut phone with the professor.
469,Joey, Richard told Monica he wants to marry her!
470,Chandler, What?!
471,Joey," Yeah! Yeah, I’ve been trying to find ya to tell to stop messing with
her and maybe I would have if these (lifts a leg) damn boat shoes wouldn’t keep
flying off!"
472,Chandler, My—Oh my God!
473,Joey, I know! They suck!!
474,Chandler," He’s not supposed to ask my girlfriend to marry him! I’m
supposed to do that!"
475,Joey, I know!
476,Chandler," Well what… Y’know what I’m gonna do? I’m gonna go
over there; I’m gonna kick his ass! (Pause) Will you help me?!"
477,Joey," Look, Chandler I don’t think us getting our asses kicked is a
solution. Okay? Just go and find Monica!"
478,Chandler, You’re right.
479,Joey, Yeah!
480,Chandler," Okay. (Starts running for the bedroom) I’m gonna get the ring!
I’m gonna get the ring! (Does so) I’m gonna go find her and (starts running for
the door) I’m just going to propose!"
481,Joey, Okay.
482,Chandler, Okay great.
483,Joey, Dude-dude-dude!
484,Chandler, What?!
485,Joey," Let me know about that coconut phone, it might great for the boat."
488,Monica, Hi.
490,Monica, I don’t know why I’m here.
492,Monica, I don’t know.
494,Monica, (entering) Chandler is such an idiot!
496,Monica," Yeah, I’ll have a scotch…"
498,Monica, (moving over to the couch) Still smoking cigars?
500,Monica," No that’s, that’s okay."
502,Monica," Uh yeah, I-I actually I thought about you a couple months ago."
504,Monica," Yeah but it was because I-I had an eye exam and I don’t like my new
eye doctor."
506,Monica, Edward Nevski?
508,Monica, No.
510,Monica," But getting over was the hardest thing that I’ve ever had to do.
And I never let myself think about you."
513,Rachel, Phoebe! You picked Joey and Ross?! You can not have two backups!
514,Phoebe," Of course I can! It’s just good sense to backup your backup! Look,
I’ve already lost Chandler!"
515,Rachel, What?!
516,Joey, (entering) Hey!
517,Ross, (entering) Hey!
518,Joey, Phoebe! We’re both (points at Ross and himself) your backup?!
519,Ross," Phoebe, how could you do this to me?!"
520,Phoebe," I don’t—Look I don’t know what you’re complaining
about now? You were both aware of the situation!"
522,Joey, No we weren’t!
523,Ross, I was not!
524,Phoebe," Okay, this kind of back talk is not gonna fly when we’re married!"
525,Rachel, Phoebe you can’t have both of them! You have to pick one!
526,Joey, Pick me!!
527,Ross, No! Pick me! I don’t want to end up an old maid!
528,Phoebe," All right well let’s see, Ross is a good father, but Joey has a
boat—This is hard!"
529,Joey," This is crazy! Hey look, I wanna switch to Rachel!"
530,Ross," Ooh, I wanna switch to Rachel too!"
532,Phoebe," No wait! Just—Okay—Just wait! You guys! Wait you guys!
Don’t make any rash decisions, okay? Just remember my promise, when we get married,
three times a week."
533,Rachel," Oh God, Phoebe!"
534,Phoebe, (To Rachel) I’m talking about massages.
535,Rachel, Oh. 
537,Rachel," Okay, y’know what?! I know-I know how to settle this! All right
here, this is what we’re gonna do! I’m gonna write Joey on one napkin (does so)
and I’m gonna right Ross on the other napkin (does so) and we are going to pick one!
And that person is going to be our backup! Okay?"
538,Joey, Okay that’s fair.
539,Ross, All right.
540,Phoebe, Good!
542,Rachel, Pick one.
543,Phoebe," Left! (Rachel hands her the napkin in her left hand and they both unfold
and read them.) Thank you."
544,Rachel, You’re welcome.
545,Phoebe, (reading) Ross!
546,Rachel, (reading) Joey! (Pause) We should just switch.
547,Phoebe, Yeah absolutely! (They both switch.)
548,Joey, Yeah.
550,Monica," (to the mask) I missed you-you ugly, flat faced old freak!"
552,Monica, Oh! (Laughs and points at the mask.) Him.
554,Monica," I missed this apartment! Now, this is a grown-up’s apartment!
Y’know, I-I should be with a grown-up, do you know what I mean?!"
556,Monica," Y’know, let’s face it, I’m not a kid anymore! I-I need to
be with someone who-who wants the same things that I do! I mean coming to my place of work
and telling me that you love me, I want that! Talking about pig sex over lunch, I don’t
want that!"
558,Monica," Fair? Please don’t even talk to me about fair! Fair would’ve
been you wanting to marry me back then! Or fair would’ve been Chandler wanting to
marry me now! Believe me, nothing about this is fair! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing!
Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing!"
560,Monica," Nothing. (She backs away a little bit but is still in his arms and looks
up at his eyes.) I don’t kn—Umm. I don’t know. Umm…"
562,Monica," Y’know, I-I… I have to figure…some st—Y’know,
some stuff before I can…"
566,Chandler," Where is she? I’m not scared of you! (Averts his eyes and walks
in.)"
568,Chandler," (examining the coffee table) Scotch on the rocks, with a twist, on a
coaster? Ha-ha, Monica! Monica!"
570,Chandler, Well where did she go?
572,Chandler," Oh my God, I can’t believe this! Y’know, I thought…I
thought you were a good guy."
574,Chandler," Nothing happened? Nothing? So you didn’t tell my girlfriend that
you love her?"
576,Chandler," Y’know what? I can’t believe this! Do you know what you did?
My girlfriend is out there thinking things over! You made my girlfriend think!!"
578,Chandler, And what does she have to think about? I love her!
580,Chandler," But I am willing to offer her all those things. This was just a
plan, y’know? A way to throw her off course so that when I offered her all these
things, she’d be surprised!"
582,Chandler," It was working until you showed up, you big tree! I mean, this
isn’t fair. You had your chance with her! You had your chance and you blew it! And
this is my chance and I am not going to blow it because we are meant for each
other! And this is all just been one stupid mistake! (Sits down heavily.) I was gonna
propose tonight."
584,Chandler," Yeah I even (pause) got a ring. (Puts in on the center cushion.) Did
you get a ring?"
586,Chandler, Y’know Richard…you are a good guy.
590,Joey, Dude!
591,Chandler," I can’t talk to you now, I gotta find Monica!"
592,Joey, She’s gone.
593,Chandler, What?
594,Joey, She’s gone. She had a bag and she left.
595,Chandler, What are you talking about?
596,Joey," She was all crying. She-she said you guys want different things, and that
and that she needed time to think."
597,Chandler," Well why didn’t you stop her?! Why didn’t you just tell her
it was a plan?!"
598,Joey," I-I did! I told her everything, Chandler! But she wouldn’t believe
me."
599,Chandler, Well where… Where did she go?
600,Joey," To her parent’s I think and she said you shouldn’t call her. But
if I were you I would."
601,Chandler, I can’t believe I ruined this.
602,Joey, I am so sorry man.
604,Monica, You wanted it to be a surprise.
606,Chandler, Oh my God.
608,Monica," Chandler… In all my life… I never thought I would be so lucky.
(Starting to cry.) As to…fall in love with my best…my best… There’s a
reason why girls don’t do this!"
609,Chandler," Okay! (He joins her on one knee) Okay! Okay! Oh God, I thought…
(Starting to cry, pauses) Wait a minute, I-I can do this. (Pause) I thought that it
mattered what I said or where I said it. Then I realized the only thing that matters is
that you, (Pause) you make me happier than I ever thought I could be. (Starting to cry
again.) And if you’ll let me, I will spend the rest of my life trying to make you
feel the same way. (Pause as he gets out the ring.) Monica, will you marry me?"
610,Monica, Yes.
612,Monica, I knew you were likely to take a wife!
614,Joey, (yelling through the door) Can we come it yet?! We’re dying out here!
615,Monica," Come in! Come in! (Joey, Rachel, and Phoebe burst through the door.)
We’re engaged!!!"
617,Rachel," Ohhh, this is the least jealous I’ve ever been!"
618,Phoebe," Oh no wait no, this is wrong! Ross isn’t here!"
619,Monica, Oh…
620,Rachel," Oh hell, he’s done this three times! He knows what its about!"
621,Joey, Yeah!
0,Ross," Hey, what’s going on?"
1,Chandler, Hey.
2,Ross," I found a note on my door, ""Come to Monica’s quick, bring
champagne and a Three Musketeers bar."""
3,Joey, (grabbing the candy bar) Yeah I’ll take that.
4,Ross, What’s up?
5,Chandler, Monica and I are engaged.
6,Ross, Oh my God. (Hugs Chandler.) Congratulations.
7,Chandler, Thanks.
8,Ross, Where is she?
10,Monica," (yelling at the top of her lungs) I’m engaged!!!!!! I’m
engaged!!!!"
12,Joey," Yeah, she’s been out there for twenty minutes, I’m surprised you
didn’t hear her on the way over."
13,Ross," Oh, I thought it was just a kid yelling, ""I’m gay! I’m
gay!"" Can I bring her in?"
14,Phoebe," Oh no, let her stay out there. It’s sweet."
16,Monica," I’m getting married!!!! I’m gonna be a bride!!!! (Someone else
yells at her.) No, I will not shut up because I’m engaged! (He yells again.) Ohh, big
talk! Huh, why don’t you come over here and say that to me?! Huh, buddy?! Yeah, my
fiancee will kick your ass! (Chandler starts to look worried.) Come on, apartment 20!
Apartment 20!"
18,Chandler," (To Ross) Okay, you get her in here. (To Joey) You bolt the door.
I’ll be in the closet."
21,Monica," Okay! Wait-wait-wait! Shhh! (Bangs on her class with a spoon to make a
toast.) Okay, umm, I just wanna say that…I love you guys so-so much and-and thank you
for being here on my special night. (Chandler clears his throat.) Our special night. I
mean it just wouldn’t be my—our-our night, if you all weren’t here to
celebrate with me—us—Damnit!"
22,Chandler," It’s okay, I want this to be your night too. (Raises his class.)
To Monica."
23,Monica," Awww, come on—wait—stop it. Okay, to Monica."
24,Chandler, To Monica!
26,Phoebe," So have you decided on a band for the wedding? Because, y’know,
I’m kinda musical."
27,Rachel," Yeah Pheebs, honey, she just got engaged a couple of hours ago. I doubt
she’s even had time to…"
28,Phoebe," Well speaking of chiming in, remember the time you burned down my
apartment?"
29,Rachel," (To Monica) Yeah, you’re on your own."
30,Monica," Y’know what we should do? We should all get dressed up and go to
have champagne at The Plaza."
32,Joey," But I-I-I can’t stay too long, I gotta get up early for a commercial
audition tomorrow and I gotta look good. I’m supposed to be playing a 19-year-old.
(Everyone stops in their tracks upon hearing this.) What?"
33,Chandler," So when you said, ""Get up early,"" did you mean 1986?"
34,Joey, You guys don’t think I look 19?
36,Phoebe," Oh, 19! We thought you said 90!"
38,Monica," Okay everybody, let’s go! Let’s go!"
39,Rachel, Okay.
40,Chandler, Okay.
42,Joey," (To Phoebe) Hey, is uh the rest of my candy bar around here?"
43,Phoebe," Oh honey no, you ate it all."
44,Joey, I was afraid of that. 
47,Monica," (looking at her hand) Y’know what shoes would look great with this
ring? Diamond shoes! (Sees Chandler sitting on the bed.) You’re not getting dressed.
(Chandler quietly folds over the comforter on the bed making a spot for her.)"
48,Chandler, Know what I mean?
49,Monica," Yeah, but I don’t think we have time."
50,Chandler," There’s gonna be a wedding. You’re gonna be the bride. Two
hundred people are going to be looking at you in a clean white dress."
51,Monica," (lustily) Let’s do it! (She kisses him and they fall back onto the
bed.)"
53,Monica," (chasing after him) Chandler! It happens to lots of guys! You-you-you
were probably tired, you had a lot of champagne, don’t worry about it!"
54,Chandler," (motioning with his hands) I’m not worried, I’m uh, I’m
fascinated. Y’know it’s like uh, Biology! Which is funny because in high school
I uh, I-I failed Biology and tonight Biology failed me. (Exits as Phoebe enters from her
room with her guitar.)"
55,Phoebe," Check it out. Okay, I can play this when the guests are coming in. Okay.
(Singing) "
57,Monica, Phoebe!
58,Phoebe," If you would’ve let me finish, it goes on to say that he’s
probably not gay."
60,Chandler," Sure, you guys don’t have this problem, you’re made of wood.
(Rachel comes out of the bathroom) Hey!"
61,Rachel, Hey!
62,Chandler, You look great!
63,Rachel," (quietly) Oh, thanks."
64,Chandler, You okay over there?
65,Rachel," I don’t know, y’know? I feel a little umm… No,
y’know what? Nevermind, I’m gonna be fine."
66,Chandler," Oh, don’t worry about it I mean you probably were tired, you had
a lot of champagne, it happens to everybody."
68,Ross, Hey!
69,Rachel, Hi!
70,Ross, Wow! Happy Monica’s night!
71,Rachel," Well thank you, you too."
72,Ross, Thanks.
73,Rachel," Hey, do you believe this? Do you believe they are actually getting
married?"
74,Ross, Well sure. But I get married all the time so…
75,Rachel, Ohh…
76,Ross, You okay?
77,Rachel," Yeah, I guess. I-I… I mean, do-do you think we’re ever gonna
have that?"
78,Ross," You mean, we—you and me?"
79,Rachel," Oh no-no-no-no-no, no, no! We, you with someone and me with someone."
80,Ross," Oh good, you scared me for a minute."
81,Rachel, Shake it off.
82,Ross," I mean—no, it’s just ‘cause, it’s just ’cause you
and I were like a nightmare. (Screams.) No, but there was some good times."
83,Rachel," No, absolutely. Y’know like it was umm…"
84,Ross, Surely you can think of something good.
85,Rachel," Yeah, just give me a minute! (Thinking) Oh well, yes, I can think of one
good thing."
86,Ross, What?
87,Rachel," Well you uh, you were always really good at the uh, at the uh the stuff."
88,Ross, Yeah? I was good at the stuff huh?
89,Rachel," Uh-hmm, uh-hmm, yeah, yeah, I really liked your hands."
90,Ross, My hands?
91,Rachel, Yeah.
92,Ross, Yeah?
93,Rachel, Uh-huh.
94,Ross," (to his hands) Way to go guys. Y’know, you-you were really good at
the stuff too."
95,Rachel," Oh, I know. Hey, y’know what we never did? (Ross looks at her.) Oh
no, not that. (Ross nods okay.) We uh, we never had bonus night!"
96,Ross, A what?
97,Rachel," Y’know, bonus night. Y’know, when two people break up but they
get back together for just one night."
98,Ross," One night, just-just sex. No strings attached?"
99,Rachel," Yeah-yeah, we never had that,"
100,Ross, No.
102,Ross," Okay, this is getting a little crazy. I mean, I’m-I’m sure it
would be amazing but I…gotta say I really-really don’t think it would be a good
idea. Y’know? I really, really…don’t."
104,Joey, ‘Sup? ‘Sup dude?
105,Chandler," (putting his hands up) Take whatever you want, just please don’t
hurt me."
106,Joey," So you’re playing a little Playstation, huh? That’s
whack! Playstation is whack! ‘Sup with the whack Playstation,
‘sup?! Huh? Come on, am I 19 or what?!"
107,Chandler," Yes, on a scale from 1 to 10, 10 being the dumbest a person can look,
you are definitely 19."
108,Joey," Come on man, really how old?!"
109,Chandler," Young! You’re a man-child okay?! Now go get changed because
everybody’s ready and please, oh please, keep my underwear!"
110,Joey, Wow thanks! (He goes into his bedroom and closes the door.)
111,Chandler, Joe?
112,Joey, Yeah!
113,Chandler," Uhh, you’ve had a lot of sex right?"
114,Joey," When? Today? Some, not a lot."
115,Chandler," Well, it’s just the reason that I’m asking is because I kind
of eh, uh, I was unable to—I mean I really wanted too, but I couldn’t….
There huh—hmm, there-there was an incident."
116,Joey," Don’t worry about that man, that happens."
117,Chandler, It’s happened to you?
118,Joey, Yeah! Once.
119,Chandler," Well, what’d you do?"
120,Joey, I did it anyway.
122,Monica," Phoebe! Come on! Let’s go! (Knocks on her door.) Come on! (Phoebe
enters with guitar and not ready to go.) Why aren’t you dressed yet?!"
123,Phoebe," I’m sorry, but I just wrote the best dance song for your wedding.
Check this out. (Gets ready to play.)"
124,Monica," (grabs the guitar away from her) No, Phoebe, I’ll tell you what, if
you get ready now I’ll let you play it at the wedding."
125,Phoebe," Really?! Oh that’s so exciting! Thank you! Thanks Mon! Oh but Mon,
if you touch my guitar again I’ll have to pound on you for a little bit."
126,Monica," Fair enough, now go get ready!"
127,Phoebe, Okay. (She goes to get ready.)
128,Monica," I’ll get everybody else (Does so), finally we can start celebrating
my—(She gasps and is stopped by the sight of Ross and Rachel making out in the hall.)
I’m sorry, uh apparently I’ve opened the door to the past."
131,Ross," Okay, Monica. Mon, uh what-what you just saw…"
132,Monica," (interrupting) Can I ask you just a little question, huh? Why tonight?"
133,Rachel, What?
134,Monica," See, I’ve been waiting my whole life to be engaged, and unlike some
people I’m only planning on doing this once. So, uh y’know, maybe this is
selfish and I’m sorry about it, but I was kinda hoping tonight could just be about
that."
135,Rachel," Oh honey, but it is just about…"
136,Ross, It is! It is!
137,Monica," No it’s not! No! No! Now it’s about you and Ross getting back
together!"
138,Rachel, What?!
139,Monica," See yeah umm, you kinda stole my thunder!"
140,Ross," Okay! Ho-ho! We did not steal your thunder because we are not
getting back together!"
141,Rachel, Yeah. No. And you know what? Nobody even saw!
142,Ross, Yeah!
143,Monica, That’s true.
144,Rachel, Honey I swear it we just kissed. 
145,Ross, It was just a kiss. (Phoebe enters and overhears this.)
146,Phoebe," You guys kissed!!!!! What does this mean?!! Are you, are you getting
back together?! Can I sing at your wedding?"
147,Monica, Thunder being stolen!!
148,Rachel," Okay come on Phoebe, it’s nothing! Monica, come on!"
149,Ross," Look let’s not make a big deal out of this! It was a one time
thing. It doesn’t even matter!"
151,Joey," Oh my God! I cannot believe you guys are talking about this! The problems
in the bedroom are between the man and the woman!!! All right?!! Now Chandler is doing the
best he can!!"
152,Chandler," (angrily) I don’t think that’s what they were talking about
Joe!!"
153,Phoebe," What a great night, Chandler can’t do it, these guys kissed…
(Points to Ross and Rachel.)"
154,Joey, What? 
155,Chandler, What?!
156,Joey, You guys kissed! Oh my—this is huge!
157,Rachel, No!
158,Ross, Oh no!
159,Rachel," No-no, it’s really not huge."
160,Ross," And; people thinking it’s huge has led Monica to believe that we
are stealing her thunder. (To Monica) Which we are not!"
161,Monica," Well, we’re still talking about it, aren’t we?"
162,Phoebe," Well yeah, that and Chandler’s problem."
163,Joey," Monica-Monica-Monica-Monica, listen-listen, listen, listen, would-would it
make you feel better if we all stop talking about Ross and Rachel."
164,Monica, Yes that would be lovely.
165,Joey," You got it. Okay. Now, I can pass for 19 right?!"
166,Chandler," Yes, you can pass for 19."
167,Joey, Really?
168,Chandler, Yes!
169,Joey, Seriously?
170,Chandler," Seriously? Seriously, no! You can play your own age which is 31!"
171,Joey, (gasps) I’m 30!
172,Rachel," Joey, you are not! You’re 31."
173,Joey, (realizes) Aww crap!
174,Phoebe," Okay, so The Plaza! Okay, we’ll get us some Mai Thai’s,
(To Chandler) maybe no more for you though."
175,Monica," Y’know what? I-I think that umm, I don’t feel like going to The
Plaza."
176,Phoebe, Why?!
177,Rachel," Honey, Monica, this is ridiculous! Look…"
178,Monica," No-no, I-I really don’t want to talk about it! I don’t! (To
Rachel) Especially with you. (Goes into her room.)"
179,Joey," Psss, that is whack!"
181,Phoebe," (she’s strumming something) Yeah? (Joey nods yes.) Okay, I think
I’ll play it at the wedding."
182,Joey," Yeah! Well, I think we’ll see if they actually let you play. Huh? I
mean they tell you anything you want to hear like-like, ""You look 19,"" and then
they just take it away like-like, ""No you don’t."""
183,Phoebe," Well, I don’t think Monica is gonna take this away."
184,Joey, Wouldn’t she?
185,Phoebe, Would she?
186,Joey," Would she? (He smells something and gasps as he realizes what it is.) You
ate my candy bar!"
188,Ross, Guess who? (Enters fully.)
189,Rachel, Hey.
190,Ross," Hey, I just realized we kinda let some stuff up in the air…"
191,Rachel," What do you think Monica mean when she said she didn’t want to
talk, especially with me? I mean, why not especially you and me? We were both out there
kissing."
192,Ross, Still thinking about it huh?
193,Rachel," Come on! Serious-ser-ser-seriously, what did she mean by that?
(Mimicking Monica.) Especially you!"
194,Ross," (loosening his tie) Oh, who cares?"
195,Rachel, I care!
196,Ross, (tightening his tie) And so do I.
197,Rachel," Y’know what, I-I have to go talk to her, would you let me just get
changed?"
198,Ross, Okay. Sure. (Sits down on her bed.)
199,Rachel, Am I going to let you watch me undress?
200,Ross, (sitting up) No! (Exits.)
202,Monica," I can’t believe her, y’know it’s just—it’s so
typical."
203,Chandler," Now Monica, I know you’re upset, but don’t forget. There is
going to be a wedding, you are going to throw the bouquet, and then there’s
going to be a honeymoon, maybe in Paris."
204,Monica, Paris?
205,Chandler, We will take a moonlit walk on the Rue de la (mumbles something).
206,Monica, Keep talking.
207,Chandler," Then we will sprinkle rose pedals on the bed and make love. Not just
because it’s romantic, but because I can!"
208,Monica, I love you!
210,Monica," (in a French accent) Bonjour, monsieur."
211,Chandler," Okay, don’t say anything, you might scare it away."
213,Chandler," It’s Paris, who knows we’re here!"
214,Monica," (opening the door) Hi Pheebs, what’s up? (She enters.)"
215,Phoebe," Okay, you said I could sing at your wedding so, I’m just gonna need
a small deposit."
216,Monica, What?!
217,Phoebe," Y’know, just some good faith money to hold the date."
218,Chandler," Pheebs, we’re not giving you a deposit for our wedding!"
219,Phoebe," Oh, I see. (Exits angrily.)"
221,Joey," They break your heart, don’t they?"
222,Phoebe," Y’know, I don’t really their permission."
223,Joey," Yeah! If you wanna sing at their wedding, well you sing at their wedding!"
224,Phoebe," Yeah! And if you wanna look 19, then you… You gotta do something
about your eyes."
225,Joey, What?! What’s wrong with my eyes.
226,Phoebe," They give you away! There’s just-there’s just too much wisdom
in there. (Joey nods in agreement.) Just put some tea bags on there for like 15 minutes."
227,Joey, And that’ll get rid of my wisdom?
228,Phoebe, Maybe just 10 minutes for you.
230,Chandler," Oh, give her the deposit! Give her the ring! I don’t care!"
232,Monica, Yes.
233,Rachel," Monica, what did you mean before when you said you didn’t want to
talk to anyone, especially me?"
234,Chandler," What a great apology! (To Monica) And you accept! Okay, bye-bye!"
235,Rachel," No-no, seriously-seriously, what was the especially me part about?"
236,Monica," Well, let’s just say it’s not the first time you’ve
stolen my thunder."
237,Rachel, What?!
238,Ross," (To Rachel) Hey, here’s a thought."
240,Rachel," Monica, what are you talking about?"
241,Monica," My Sweet Sixteen! Remember, you went to third base with my cousin
Charlie."
242,Chandler," (entering) Ahh, third base."
243,Monica, It’s all everybody at the party could talk about!
244,Rachel," Monica, y’know what? The only reason I did that was because your
party was so boring!"
245,Monica, (gasps) We had a characturist!
246,Rachel, Oh!! 
247,Phoebe," (singing, angrily) "
250,Rachel," Monica, your Sweet Sixteen was like a million years ago."
251,Monica," And yet, here we are doing it again."
252,Rachel," Ugh, Monica I don’t want to steal your stupid thunder!"
253,Monica, Oh please! Why else would you have made out with Ross?!
254,Ross, Got me. (He shows of his hands.)
255,Rachel," All right, easy mimey, the moment has passed, it ain’t gonna
happen!"
256,Monica, I just thought it would be nice if I could have just this one night!
257,Rachel," I swear, I never wanted any part of your night!"
258,Monica," Oh, is that why you did it the secret hallway where nobody ever goes?!"
259,Ross," Uh, Rachel, I’ve been thinking. I don’t think us getting
together tonight is such a good idea. I’m calling it off."
260,Chandler, (To Ross) Why to save your dignity my man.
261,Rachel," (ignoring them) Monica, why? Why would I ever want to take away from
your night?"
262,Monica," I don’t know! I don’t—maybe you’re feeling a little
resentful. Maybe ah, maybe you thought you’d get married first! Maybe you can’t
stand the fact that your formally fat friend is getting married before you!"
263,Rachel," Oh wow. That—y’know what? That is so unfair. Y’know what?
Now I want to steal your thunder! Come on Ross, let’s go have sex!"
265,Monica," (yelling after them) I can’t believe you’re gonna have sex on
my engagement night!!"
266,Chandler," Well, somebody should. (Monica glares at him.)"
268,Ross," Look uh, if we’re gonna do this…"
269,Rachel," We’re not gonna do this, all right? She’s just gonna think
that we’re doin’ it."
270,Ross," Oh, I see, so everybody wins. "
272,Rachel, Who is it?
273,Monica," (outside the door) It’s Monica, open up!"
274,Rachel," Okay well Ross! Stop it please! Wait a minute! (Motions for him to
follow her lead, but he angrily shakes his head no. So she pokes him.)"
275,Ross, Oww!
276,Rachel," Yeah, you like that baby? (Monica bursts in followed by Chandler.) May
we help you?"
277,Monica," I just wanted to say that I hope you do have sex tonight and I hope that
you guys get back together, but I must warn you, the night that you announce your
engagement I’m going to announce that I’m pregnant!"
278,Chandler, How is that ever going to happen?!
279,Rachel," All right Monica, do you want to know why I was with Ross tonight?!"
280,Monica, I know why!
281,Rachel, No you don’t know why!
282,Monica, Okay! Why?!
283,Rachel, Because! Because I was sad.
284,Monica, What do you mean?
285,Rachel," Look, I am so…so happy for you guys, but you getting married just
reminds me of the fact that I’m not. I’m not even close. And I don’t know,
maybe I just wanted to make myself feel better. And I know that that’s dumb, but oh
my God you were so depressed when Ross got married that you slept with Chandler!"
287,Chandler," (To Ross) I don’t care, she slept with me."
288,Rachel," Anyway sweetie, I am, I’m so sorry I ruined your night."
289,Monica," (starting to cry) I’m sorry I almost made you sleep with Ross.
(They hug.)"
290,Ross," (deadpan) Well, I’m going to take off. (To Chandler) Congratulations
man."
291,Chandler, Thanks.
292,Ross," (at the door) And uh, Rachel."
293,Rachel, Yeah.
294,Ross," What can I say, you missed your chance. From now on the only person
who’s going to enjoy these bad boys (holds up his hands) is me. (Quickly realizes
what he said and exits disgustedly.) "
297,Phoebe, (singing)
299,Chandler," (interrupting her just in time) Hey! Here’s a dollar, consider it
a deposit. Please sing at our wedding."
300,Phoebe, Oh thank you.
301,Chandler, Okay. (Goes back to bed.)
302,Phoebe," Now… (Starts singing again) ""Who will perform the ceremony!
Who will perform the cer—(Chandler enters and grabs her guitar and closes the
door behind him)—Oh—oh! All right, I’ll pound on him in the morning."
0,Joey, Hey!
1,Ross, Hi!
2,Joey, Who wants French toast?
3,Ross," Oh, I’ll have some!"
4,Joey," Good, me too. (Tosses him the loaf.) Eggs and milk are in the fridge.
Thanks."
5,Monica, (entering from her room) Oww!
6,Chandler, What’s the matter honey?
7,Monica," I don’t know, my hand feels weird. I guess it’s because,
I’m engaged! (Shows off the ring.) How long before it starts getting annoying?"
8,Phoebe, It starts?
9,Rachel," Yeah, so let’s get started on the wedding plans!"
10,Monica, Okay! (Runs off.)
11,Chandler, (incredulous) Already?!
12,Rachel," Yeah, we got a lot to do! We gotta think about the flowers, the
caterers, the music…"
13,Chandler," Oh, I got some thoughts on that."
14,Rachel," Oh wait Chandler, too many cooks…"
15,Ross," Take from me, as the groom all you have to do is show up and try to say
the right name."
16,Monica," (returning) Okay! (Sets down a huge 3"" 3-ring binder on the table.)"
17,Chandler, What in God’s name is that?!
18,Ross," Oh my God, the wedding book?! I haven’t seen that since the forth
grade!"
19,Monica," This baby has got everything. Take y’know, locations for instance.
(She opens up the binder to the locations chapter.) First, organized alphabetically, then
geographically, then by square footage. "
20,Phoebe," That is so smart! (To Chandler, under her breath) Break it off. Break it
off now."
23,Ross," And that should conclusively prove that I had the idea for Jurassic
Park first! Now let’s take a look at… (Phoebe rushes in.)"
24,Phoebe, Hey! Ross!
25,Ross," Phoebe, oh my God! Wh-wh-what are you doing here?"
26,Phoebe," I need to talk to you, it’s pretty urgent. It’s about Monica
and Chandler."
27,Ross," Oh my God! Of course, of course. (To the class.) Umm, would you please
excuse me for a moment? Umm, do you know each other’s hometowns? Why don’t
you… (Motions that they should learn everyone’s hometown.) (To Phoebe)
Wh-what’s going on?"
28,Phoebe," Well, umm, not much. But, I was just thinking that since those guys just
got engaged that maybe it would be nice if they had some privacy, y’know? So, could I
just move in with you for a couple days?"
29,Ross," Umm, okay, yeah, sure. But wh-what’s wrong with Monica and Chandler?"
30,Phoebe, Nothing—Why?!
31,Ross," Phoebe, you said it was urgent!"
32,Phoebe," Oh yeah it is! I’m going to the movies and it starts in like five
minutes."
33,Ross, Do you realize I have a classroom full of students?
34,Phoebe," (to the students) Oh, I’m sorry. I’m so rude. Does anyone want
to come to the movies?"
36,Monica," All right, so I haven’t cleared the budget with my parents yet, but
tell me how this is for music."
37,Rachel, Okay.
38,Monica," All right umm, a string quartet for the procession."
39,Rachel, Aw.
40,Monica," A jazz trio for cocktails. The Bay City Rollers for dancing.
Wait, that was from my sixth grade wedding."
41,Chandler," Well, you couldn’t get them anyway. Ian doesn’t plan anymore
and Derrick… (Off of Rachel and Monica’s looks) And Derrick is a name I
shouldn’t know."
42,Joey," (sitting up from the couch) Hey Mon, do you have another pillow? (Holds up
one.) Y’know, something a little snugglyer?"
43,Chandler, Why are you napping over here instead of over at your place?
44,Joey," Well, the duck…"
45,Rachel, What?! The duck?! What the hell did the damn duck do now?!
46,Joey," Uh, well he did not get sick somewhere in there and it was
immediately found and properly cleaned up!"
47,Chandler," Now, do I get to look at this book or is it just for people who are
actually involved in the wedding?"
48,Monica," Of course you can look at it! Yeah, I want your opinion too!"
49,Chandler, Okay.
50,Monica, Here you go! What do you think about centerpieces?
51,Chandler, Centerpieces!
52,Monica, Yeah! Roses or Lilies? (Holds up a picture of each.)
53,Chandler," Definitely roses. (Monica and Rachel exchange a look.) Well, I just
think they’re a little more weddingy. (Monica holds the Lily picture closer to him.)
But Lilies are the clear choice."
54,Monica, Oh my God! It’s like one mind.
55,Chandler, Uh-huh!
56,Joey," (sitting up again) Guys! Guys!! You gotta let me nap! Ugh, I’m
gonna get cranky!"
57,Rachel," Joey, there is a perfectly good couch across the hall!"
58,Joey," Yes it is perfectly good, and it is not one of the places the duck
got sick!"
59,Rachel, What?!
60,Joey," All right, I’m gonna go! (Gets up and heads for the door.)"
61,Rachel," Now Joey, what did the duck do?!"
62,Joey, I don’t know! But he did not eat your face cream!
64,Joey," Hey little buddy, how are you feeling? (The duck does not get sick
and Joey recoils in horror and heads for the couch.) What the hell is in that face cream?
(He’s about to try out the couch but notices the bed in Rachel’s room. He walks
into her room and feels the bed.) That’s so soft. (He pulls back the comforter.)
Pillowcases! (He climbs in and groans in delight. Suddenly, he feels something under him
and pulls out a little beat up paperback book. He opens it and starts to read from it.)
(In his head.) Zelda looked at the chimney sweep. Her father, the vicar…(Stops
reading and thinks.) The vicar? (Continues reading) …wouldn’t be home
for hours. Her loins were burning. She threw caution to the wind and reached out and
grabbed his…(Out loud.) Whoa! (Reads on in silence.) Whoa-ho-ho-ho! This is a
dirty book! (Continues to read.)"
66,Ross," Uh, Phoebe…"
67,Phoebe," Oh Ross, hi."
68,Ross," Phoebe, what are you doing?"
69,Phoebe," I’m sorry, I’m with a client right now."
70,Ross, Phoebe!
71,Phoebe," Okay, let’s talk outside."
73,Ross," Phoebe, you can’t massage people in my apartment!"
74,Phoebe, What’s the big deal? I did it at Monica and Chandler’s!
75,Ross, And they knew about it?
76,Phoebe," (pause as she considers it) Okay, well Ross, what is this really about?"
77,Ross," Look, this is my home and I want to be able to come and go whenever I
want!"
78,Phoebe," Okay, I will find someplace else to do the rest of my appointments. I
just don’t know what the big deal is!"
79,Ross," The big deal is I don’t want naked, greasy strangers in my apartment
when I want to kick back with a puzzle—beer! Cold beer."
81,Rachel," Hey Joey, what ‘cha doing?"
82,Joey, Sweepin’. Why? Turn you on?
83,Rachel, No.
84,Joey, Huh. What if I was sweeping a chimney?
85,Rachel," Joey, did you my face cream?"
87,Joey, Where are you going? The vicar won’t be home for hours.
89,Rachel," Joey, (nervously) where did you learn that word?"
90,Joey," Where do you think, (pause) Zelda?"
91,Rachel, (gasps) You found my book?!
92,Joey, Yeah I did!
93,Rachel," Joey, what-what are you doing going into my bedroom?!"
94,Joey," Okay, look I’m sorry, I went in there to take a nap and I know I
shouldn’t have, but you got porn!"
95,Rachel," Hey-hey, y’know what? I don’t care! I’m not ashamed of my
book. There’s nothing with a woman enjoying a little…erotica. It’s just a
healthy expression of female sexuality, which by the way, you will never understand. (She
goes into her room.)"
96,Joey, You got porn!
98,Ross, Hello.
100,Ross," Uh no-no, she-she’s out for the night."
102,Ross," Can I, can I help you with something?"
104,Ross, (deadpan) Yes I am.
109,Chandler," Oh yeah, I should probably call them."
111,Chandler," Oh, I don’t think I ever heard that story."
112,Monica," Oh dad, really you don’t need to…"
115,Chandler, What a sweet story.
116,Monica," Well, at least you’re not hearing it for the first time at your
fifth grade Halloween party."
118,Monica," Anyway, we’re really excited about our wedding plans, and well I
guess pretty soon we’ll be making a big withdrawal from the Monica wedding fund.
(Chandler and her laugh, but her parents don’t.) What?"
120,Monica, What happened? You still have the Monica wedding fund don’t you?
124,Monica, I don’t believe you spent my wedding fund on the beach house!
126,Monica, You bought the beach house when I was 23!
130,Monica, What about when I started dating Chandler?
132,Chandler," Clearly I did not start drinking enough at the start of the meal.
(Starts to make up for lost time and takes a big swig of his drink.)"
133,Monica, I can’t believe it! That there is no money for my wedding?!
139,Ross," Okay! Now, I’m going to touch you. (He does so, very gingerly.) Ohh,
that’s soft. (He starts poking him and notices his salad spoons and starts to massage
him with those.)"
141,Monica," I can’t believe this. Do you think that your parents could help pay
for it?"
142,Chandler," I don’t know, my mother spent most of her money on her fourth
wedding. She’s saving the rest for her divorce. And any extra cash my father has he
saves for his yearly trips to (Pause) Dollywood."
143,Rachel, Well what happened at dinner?
144,Monica, My parents spent the money for our wedding!
145,Phoebe, (gasps) My God! What did you order?!
146,Rachel," Wait, but there’s no money! Well this is terrible! You guys are
gonna have to get married in like a, rec. center!"
147,Chandler," Honey, it’s gonna be okay."
148,Monica," No! No it’s not! It’s not gonna be okay! It sucks! No swing
band! No lilies!"
149,Rachel," No, y’know what? It’s gonna be okay. I mean you don’t
have to have this rustic Italian feast. Y’know? And-and you don’t need, you
don’t need this custom-made, empire waisted, duchess, satin gown; you can wear off
the rack. (She starts to cry, as does Monica.)"
150,Chandler," Look, it really is gonna be okay. The important thing is that we love
each other and that we’re gonna get married."
151,Rachel, Do you even understand what off the rack means?!
152,Phoebe," Look, why don’t you just pay for it yourself?"
153,Monica, How? I don’t have any money.
154,Chandler," Well, I have some."
155,Monica, How much?
156,Chandler," Well, close to… (Notices Rachel leaning in to hear and decides to
write it on a piece of paper and hand it to Monica as Phoebe averts her eyes.) "
157,Monica, Whoa!!! Are you kidding me?!
158,Rachel, Well what?! How-how much is it?!
159,Monica, It’s enough for wedding scenario eight.
160,Rachel, Ohh! (Whispers.) Really?!
161,Monica," (To Chandler) How great are you, you little saver?! I mean, the-the
amount you have is exactly the budget of my dream wedding!"
162,Rachel," (starting to cry) Ohh, you guys are so made for each other."
163,Chandler," Well, you’re not suggesting that we spend all of the money on the
wedding?"
165,Chandler," Well, come on, I’ve been saving this money for six years and I
kinda had some of it earmarked for the future, not just for a party."
166,Phoebe," (reading the slip of paper) Wow! (In a sultry voice) Hello, Mr.
Chandler."
167,Monica, This is the most special day of our lives.
168,Chandler," No, I realize that honey, but I’m not gonna spend all of the
money on one party."
169,Monica," Honey, umm I-I love you, (laughs) but umm, if you call our wedding a
party one more time, you may not get invited. Okay? (Laughs) Listen, we could always
earn more money, okay? But uh, we’re only gonna get married once."
170,Chandler," Look, I understand, but I have to put my foot down. Okay? The answer
is no."
171,Monica, You-you’re gonna have to put your foot down?
172,Chandler," Yes, I am!"
173,Phoebe," Wow, money and a firm hand. Finally a Chandler I can get on board with."
175,Joey, Hey Rach.
176,Rachel, (quietly) Joey.
177,Joey," Hey Rach, do you smell smoke?"
178,Rachel," Uh-huh, I get it, smoke, chimney, chimney sweep, very funny, ha-ha."
179,Joey," No-no-no, I’m serious. You don’t smell it? Something’s on
fire."
180,Rachel," Well no, I don’t smell anything."
181,Joey," Oh, y’know what? It’s probably just your burnin’ loins."
182,Ross," (sitting down) Hey, what are you guys, what are you guys talking about?"
183,Rachel, Nothing!
184,Ross," (takes a drink) Damn, this coffee’s cold! Hey Rach, do you mind if I
heat this up on your loins? (Joey and he both laugh.)"
185,Rachel," Y’know, I can not believe you told him, Joey!"
186,Ross, So I guess you bought that book after we broke up huh?
187,Rachel," Uh-huh, yeah I did, because I wore out my first copy when I was with
you. (Exits.)"
188,Ross," (chases her) Oh yeah, yeah? Well uh, when we were going out, I read tons
of porno magazines! (Realizes a table of women overheard him.) (To that table.) ‘Sup?"
189,Phoebe, (entering) Ross! How could you do that to an old man?!
190,Ross, (looking at the table) Excuse me ladies. (To Phoebe) I’m sorry?
191,Phoebe," My massage client, Arthur? His daughter called and said that some guy
that worked for me gave him a really weird massage this afternoon."
192,Ross, (incredulous) I gave him an extremely professional massage!
193,Phoebe, He said you poked at him with wooden spoons.
194,Ross," Okay, so it wasn’t uh, a traditional massage. But I did give him
accu-pressure with a pair of chopsticks. And, and I gently exfoliated him with, with a
mop."
195,Phoebe," Well, he’s never coming back! Okay? You just cost me eight dollars
a week!"
196,Ross," Hey, y’know what? This is your fault! You’re the one that
didn’t move his-his appointment."
197,Phoebe," Oh, it’s my fault?! You didn’t have to massage him! You
could’ve sent him away! You could’ve not rolled Tonka trucks up and down
his back!"
198,Ross," He said he liked that!! Oh you’re right, you’re right. I’m
sorry."
199,Joey," Dude, what are you massaging an old man for?"
200,Ross, His daughter was hot.
201,Joey, Gotcha.
203,Monica, Hey.
204,Chandler, Hey.
205,Monica," Listen umm, I’ve been thinking, it’s not fair for me to ask
you to spend all of your money on our wedding. I mean, you work, you work really hard for
that."
206,Chandler, Ehh.
207,Monica," Eh, you work for that."
208,Chandler," Look, I thought about it too, and I’m sorry. I think we should
spend all of the money on the wedding."
209,Monica, You do?!
210,Chandler," Yeah, I’m putting my foot down. Yeah look, when I proposed I told
you that I would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes
you happy then, then that’s what we’re gonna do."
211,Monica," Oh, you’re so sweet. (They hug and kiss.) Oh, but wait, what about
our, what about the future and stuff?"
212,Chandler," Eh, forget about the future and stuff! So we only have two kids,
y’know? We’ll pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college."
213,Monica, You thought about that?
214,Chandler, Yeah.
215,Monica, How many kids were we gonna have?
216,Chandler," Uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy."
217,Monica, What else did you think about?
218,Chandler," Well, stuff like where’d we live, y’know? Like a small place
outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. Y’know,
we could have a cat that had a bell on it’s collar and we could hear it every time it
ran through the little kitty door. Of course, we’d have an apartment over the garage
where Joey could grow old."
219,Monica," (laughs) Y’know what? I-I don’t want a big, fancy wedding."
220,Chandler, Sure you do.
221,Monica," No, I want everything you just said. I want a marriage."
222,Chandler, You sure?
223,Monica, Uh-hmm.
224,Chandler, I love you so much.
225,Monica," I love you. (They kiss.) Hey listen umm, when, when you were
talkin’ about our future you said cat, but you meant dog right."
226,Chandler," Oh yeah, totally!"
227,Monica, Oh good.
230,Joey," Hello, Zelda."
231,Rachel, Who are you supposed to be?
232,Joey, The vicar!
233,Rachel, Do you even know what a vicar is?
234,Joey," Like a goalie, right?"
235,Rachel," (sarcastically) Yeah. Look Joey, it’s enough all right?! You keep
making these stupid jokes and this sleazy innuendoes and it’s—I’m
not—it’s just not funny anymore!"
236,Joey," All right, I’m sorry. Rach I—Rach I’m sorry. Okay? I’m
sorry! Maybe I can make up for it by, taking you roughly in the barn. (Giggles.)"
237,Rachel," All right! Y’know what? That’s it! You wanna do it?!
Let’s do it!"
238,Joey, Huh?
239,Rachel," (starting to move closer to him) That’s right, I wanna do it with
you! I’ve been trying to fight it, but you just said all the right things."
240,Joey, (nervously backing away) I-I-I-I did? (He puts a stool in front of her.)
241,Rachel," (moves the stool out of the way) Yeah! Ohh, I’ve been waitin’
so long to get on that body!"
242,Joey, This body? (He backs into the kitchen.)
243,Rachel, Yeah that’s right! Come on Joey; sex me up!
244,Joey," Hey-hey, you’re startin’ to sound like the butcher’s wife
there in-in chapter seven."
245,Rachel," Oh, come on now, don’t keep me waiting. Get those clothes off! But,
I would keep that helmet on because you’re in for a rough ride! (He backs into
the door.)"
246,Joey," I don’t want to, I’m scared."
0,Chandler," Hey, you guys!"
2,Chandler," So, what do you think?"
3,Ross, About what?
4,Rachel," Yeah, what?"
5,Joey, What?
6,Chandler," Are you kidding? Okay, I’ll give you a hint; I’ll give you a
hint. (Points to his glasses.)"
7,Joey," Eyes! No, no. Your eyes! No. Chandler’s eyes!"
8,Chandler, I got glasses!
9,Ross," Well, you-you’ve always had glasses."
10,Chandler, No I didn’t!
11,Ross, Are you sure?
12,Rachel," Yeah-yeah, did-didn’t you use to have a pair? They were really
round, burgundy, and they made you look kind of umm…"
13,Joey, Feminine.
14,Rachel, Yes!
15,Chandler, No!
16,Monica," Sweetie, I think the glasses look great. They make you look really sexy."
17,Chandler, Really?
18,Monica, Yeah!
19,Chandler," (sitting down on the arm of her chair) You didn’t think I used to
wear glasses, right?"
20,Monica," Of course! (She mouths, ""I have no idea,"" to the rest of the
gang.)"
23,Phoebe, So what do you guys want for an engagement present?
24,Chandler," That’s okay Pheebs, we’re not having a party or anything, so
you don’t have to get us…"
25,Monica," (interrupts him) If someone wants to give us a present, we don’t
want to deprive them of that joy."
26,Rachel," Oh, y’know what you should get ‘em? One of those little uh,
portable CD players."
27,Monica," Oh, I already have one. "
28,Phoebe, Not unless someone borrowed it and left it at the gynecologist.
29,Rachel," Yeah, and-and-and by someone, she means Joey."
30,Monica," Hey, I know I what I want!"
31,Chandler, What we want honey.
32,Monica," No, you don’t want this. I want to have your grandmother’s
cookie recipe."
33,Phoebe, You mean the chocolate chip cookie recipe?
34,Monica," Uh-huh, yeah."
35,Phoebe," You mean the one that my grandmother made me swear on her deathbed that
I would never let out of our family?"
36,Chandler, Dying people say the craziest things.
37,Monica, I wanted it for years! I was gonna make cookies for my children.
38,Phoebe," Break my heart—Oh, all right."
39,Monica," Okay. I’m gonna be the mom that makes the world’s best
chocolate chip cookies."
40,Chandler, Our kids are gonna be fat aren’t they.
41,Joey, (entering) Ahoy!
42,Chandler, Hey! How’s the boat?!
43,Joey, Great! I’m finally getting into this sailing stuff.
44,Monica," Oh, so you finally took it out of the marina huh?"
45,Joey, Why would I do that? It took three guys to get the thing in there!
46,Phoebe," If you don’t sail your boat, what do you do on it?"
47,Joey," Oh, it’s great! It’s a great place to just kinda, sit, hang
around, drink a few beers, eat some chips. (He says that as he sits, hangs around, drinks
a beer, and eats a chip.)"
48,Chandler," Well, it’s good that you finally have a place to do that."
49,Rachel," Y’know Joey, I could teach you to sail if you want."
50,Joey, You could?
51,Rachel," Yeah! I’ve been sailing my whole life. When I was fifteen my dad
bought me my own boat."
52,Phoebe, Your own boat?
53,Rachel, What?! What?! He was trying to cheer me up! My pony was sick.
55,Chandler, Do you know what I was thinkin’?
56,Monica, What?
57,Chandler," Nothing, I just like to go like this. (Does it again.)"
58,Ross," (entering from the bathrooms) Hey Chandler, what are you doing tonight?"
59,Chandler," Uh why, do you have a lecture?"
60,Ross," No, why?"
61,Chandler, Then free as a bird. What’s up?
62,Ross, My dad wanted to know if you wanted to play racquetball with us.
63,Monica," Wow! That’s great! Dad must really like you, he doesn’t ask
just anyone to play."
64,Ross," Yeah and he didn’t really ask for you, he asked for Chancy, I assumed
he meant you."
65,Chandler," Well, did-did you correct him?"
66,Ross," No, I-I thought it would be more fun this way."
67,Monica," This is so cool, maybe this is something you can do every week."
68,Ross," Or you can sit with him on the front porch and make sure no one steals the
trash cans. He does that every week too."
69,Monica," Oh, just so you know, you-you have to let him win."
70,Ross, Yeah.
71,Monica, He hates to lose.
72,Chandler," Oh no problem, maybe I’ll play with my left hand."
73,Ross, You’re not a lefty? 
74,Chandler, Does anybody know me?!
76,Monica, What’s wrong Phoebe?
77,Phoebe," I just went to my old apartment to get you the-the cookie recipe and the
stupid fire burned it up!"
78,Monica," No!! Why didn’t you make a copy and-and keep it in a fireproof box
and keep it at least a hundred yards from the original?!!"
79,Phoebe," (pauses as he figures out how to answer that) Because I’m normal!
That was the one legacy my grandmother left me, and I know you wanted it as an
engagement present."
80,Ross," Oh, we have to get you an engagement present?"
81,Chandler, Don’t worry about it Pheebs.
82,Ross, No one got me an engagement present.
83,Phoebe," Okay, here I wish you health and happiness. (She hands Monica a cookie
in a plastic baggie.) "
84,Chandler, An old cookie?
85,Monica," (To Chandler) This is what happens when you don’t register for
gifts!"
86,Phoebe," See no-no, I made a batch and I froze it, and this is the only one left."
87,Chandler, We can’t accept this.
88,Phoebe, Why not?
89,Chandler, ‘Cause it’s gross.
90,Monica," No! Wait! I think I can figure out the recipe from this cookie! I do
stuff like this at work all the time."
91,Phoebe, Really?!
92,Monica, Yeah! I bet I can do it.
94,Chandler," Okay, we owe you a present."
95,Ross, Two! I’ve been engaged twice!
97,Joey," (drinking a beer) Look at this clown! Just because he’s got a bigger
boat he thinks he can take up the whole river. (Yelling) Get out of the way jackass! (To
Rachel) Who names his boat Coast Guard anyway?"
98,Rachel, That is the Coast Guard. 
99,Joey," What are they doing out here? The coast’s all the way over there.
(Points to the coast, meanwhile there is coast behind him.)"
100,Rachel," Joey, just ignore the boats all right? We’re not finished with the
lesson yet."
101,Joey, All right.
102,Rachel," Okay, I’m just gonna go over the basic points just one more time,
are you ready?"
103,Joey," Come on Rach, not again. I got it! Okay? Let’s start sailing, and I
want to go over there (Points) where that boatload of girls is! (Yelling to them)
Yo-ho-ho!"
104,Rachel," Oh, okay. Is that what you want to do? You wanna go over and give a
little shout out to the old, hot chickas? Okay, let’s do that Sailor Joe. Quick
question though, (grabs some of the rigging) what’s this called?"
105,Joey," Uh, boat rope."
106,Rachel, Wrong! How do you get the mainsail up?
107,Joey," Uhh, rub it?"
108,Rachel, No. What do you do if I say we are coming about?
109,Joey," I’d say, come again. No-no, wait I-I-I know this one, I know this
one, uh…"
111,Rachel," Time’s up, now your dead."
112,Joey, And deaf!
113,Rachel," Okay, you just go on and make your little jokey-jokes, but if you do not
know what you are doing out at sea you will die at sea. Am I getting through to you
sailor?! (She punctuates each word by slapping him on the forehead.)"
114,Joey, Yes.
115,Rachel," Don’t just say yes! This isn’t a game, Joey you can really get
hurt out here. Okay, so do you want to pay attention or do you want to die?!"
116,Joey, I want to make a ship to shore call to Chandler.
118,Monica," All right, I definitely taste nutmeg."
119,Phoebe, You do?
120,Monica," You don’t? (Laughs) Well, that’s the difference between a
professional and a layman."
121,Phoebe, That and arrogance.
122,Joey, (entering) Hey.
123,Monica, Hey! How was sailing?
124,Joey," I don’t want to talk about it. Y’know, you could’ve at
least saved me a whole cookie. (He grabs what’s left of the cookie and pops in his
mouth.)"
126,Joey, (recoils in horror) Women are mean!!! (Storms out.)
127,Phoebe," I can’t believe that! Now the only thing left of my
grandmother’s legacy is this crumb. (She picks it up with her finger and holds it out
to Monica.) I wish you a long and happy marriage."
128,Ross, (entering with Chandler) Hey.
129,Monica, Hey! How was it?
130,Ross," Well I had a great time! Umm, Chancy on the other hand…"
131,Chandler," I will tell the story! It was going great. I let him win. We
were bonding. He even said I could call him dad."
132,Ross, And what did he ask you not to call him?
133,Chandler," Daddy. All right look, here’s the story. (Flashback to Chandler
about to enter the steam room as he does the voice-over.) Well, we had just finished
playing racquetball and we were gonna take a steam. I walk into the steam room and it was
really steamy. (The flashback shows his glasses fog up and him trying to find his way
around the steam filled room. He takes off his glasses.) So I take off my glasses and
that’s when in happened."
135,Chandler, Guys?
136,Ross, Over here. (You can see Ross sitting at the far wall.)
140,Monica, Oh my God Chandler! I can’t believe it!
141,Chandler, I know.
142,Monica, You gave my father a lap dance!
143,Chandler, Why do they put so much steam in there?!
144,Ross, ‘Cause otherwise they’d have to call it the room room.
145,Chandler, Why? Okay? Why? Wh-wh-why did that have to happen?
146,Phoebe," Come on, it’s not that big a deal!"
147,Chandler, Not that big a deal? There…there was touching of things.
148,Ross," Now, I know you wanted to bond with my dad, but did you really have to
bond to that part?"
149,Monica," Listen, I’m sure that dad doesn’t care. He probably thought
this was funny; he’ll be telling this story for years!"
150,Chandler, I don’t want him to tell this story for years.
151,Ross," Oh, but he will. He still tells the story how Monica tried to escape from
fat camp."
152,Monica, I wasn’t escaping.
153,Ross, Then how did you get caught in the barbed wire?
154,Monica, I was trying to help out a squirrel.
155,Ross, You were trying to eat it!
157,Chandler," If that is your father calling to tell this story then the
marriage is off!"
158,Monica," (takes the phone from Ross) Come on. (Answering phone) Hello? (Listens)
I’m sorry you have the wrong number. (Listens) (Whispering) Okay, I’ll call you
later dad. I love you. (Hangs up.)"
160,Chandler," (getting up) All right, I’m off to see your dad."
161,Ross," Whoa-whoa, aren’t you a little over dressed?"
162,Rachel," (laughing) Yeah, and-and you better make sure he tips you this time."
163,Chandler," Look, I figured I would try to convince him not to tell the story
anymore, and I figure the best way to do that is face to face—And by face I
don’t mean his lap. And by face, I don’t mean my ass. (Exits.)"
164,Ross, (To Rachel) Hey are you getting Monica and Chandler an engagement present?
165,Rachel," I don’t know. Y’know, they didn’t get us anything."
166,Ross, Thank you!
167,Joey, (entering) Hey.
168,Ross, Hey.
169,Rachel," Well hello! So, when are we gettin’ back out on the water matey? "
170,Joey," Oh uh, I don’t know the boat way to say this, but uh never!"
171,Rachel, Why not?
172,Joey, Because! You’re mean on the boat!
173,Rachel, What? I was just trying to teach you.
174,Joey," Well, lesson learned! Rachel is mean!"
175,Ross," Yeeeeeep… Yep-yep-yep-yep-yep. I remember when she took out on her
dad’s boat she wouldn’t let me help at all."
176,Rachel," Excuse me, I wanted you to help, but you couldn’t move your arms
because you were wearing three life jackets."
177,Ross, You have to respect the sea! (Storms off.)
178,Rachel," Look Joey, I’m sorry if-if you thought that was mean, but I gotta
tell ya something. That was not mean. Okay, my father is mean. He used to yell at me all
the time on the boat, I mean it was horrible. I was just being a good teacher."
179,Joey," Does a good teacher say, ""Put down the beer pinhead!?"""
180,Rachel," Well, does a good student drink seven beers during his first lesson?"
181,Joey, Six and a half! You knocked that last one out of my hand! Remember?
182,Rachel," Yeah, I didn’t want you to get hit by the boom!"
183,Joey," Well it hit me anyway! And it would’ve hurt a lot less if I had
finished that last beer."
184,Rachel," All right, y’know what? I-I’m sorry. I will try to tone it
down and uh stop yelling."
185,Joey, You won’t boss me around anymore?
186,Rachel, I won’t boss you around.
187,Joey, And you’ll be nice?
188,Rachel," And, I’ll be nice."
189,Joey, And you’ll be topless?
190,Rachel, And—Joey!
191,Joey, Do you want me to learn?!
193,Monica," Okay, here’s batch 22. Ohh, maybe these’ll taste a little like
your grandmother’s. This has a little bit of orange peel, but no nutmeg."
194,Ross, Let’s give it a shot.
195,Monica," Okay. Man, I have not made this many cookies since I was in the
ninth grade."
196,Phoebe," Oh, what was that for? Like a bake sale?"
197,Monica," No, just a Friday night."
199,Ross," Ohh, these are pretty good."
200,Phoebe," Yeah, but not as good as batch 17."
201,Ross, Which one was that?
202,Monica, The ones we had right after you almost threw up.
203,Ross," Oh yeah! Batch 17 was good. I did not like batch 16. (Burps a
little bit.) I’m okay."
204,Phoebe," Are there anymore from the good batch? ‘Cause we could just work
off of those."
205,Ross," Yeah, ooh yeah, I think there is one from batch 17 left, uh… (Grabs a
cookie and takes a big bite out of it and doesn’t like it.) It’s batch 16! 16
people! Get out of the way! (Gets up and runs for the bathroom.)"
207,Rachel," Okay Joey honey, you’re doing really good! All right, now I’m
just gonna need you to step to the port side. (Joey pauses as he tries to remember which
side is the port side.) Remember? Remember how we talked about the port side?"
208,Joey, Ohh yeah.
209,Rachel, Right?
210,Joey, Nope.
211,Rachel," It’s left sweetie, but that’s okay sweetie, that’s a
tough one."
212,Joey, I don’t know why you just don’t say left.
213,Rachel," Okay, go to the left. (Joey goes starboard or sits on the right side of
the boat.) The left!"
214,Joey, Huh?
215,Rachel, (yelling) Just sit over there!! (Points to the port side.)
216,Joey," (hurrying over) Okay! Okay, you’re yelling again! See that?"
217,Rachel," No! No-no, no-no-no, very quiet, said with love, no yelling."
218,Joey," Oh, y’know what? Since I’m here, I think I’m gonna have me
a little beer on the port side. (Grabs and opens one.)"
219,Rachel," Okay Joey, we’re luffing a little bit, so could you tighten up the
cunningham? (The mainsail has started to flap in the wind and has stopped working
efficiently; she wants him to tighten it so that it starts working again.)"
220,Joey," Uh, wow, you just said a bunch of stuff I didn’t know there."
221,Rachel," Joey, come on! We just went over this! (She does it instead.)"
222,Joey," Oh, y’know, when we did that was when that bird was flying overhead
with the fish in his mouth. Did you see it? It was gross!"
223,Rachel," (angrily) No! All right?! I did not see the bird! I did not
see the fish! I did not see the piece of Styrofoam that was shaped like Mike Tyson!
I did not, because I was trying to teach you how to sail a boat! Which
obviously is an impossible thing to do!"
224,Joey," All right that’s it! You’re yelling and I don’t see you
taking your top off! I quit!"
225,Rachel, What do you mean you quit?! You can’t quit!
226,Joey, Why not?!
227,Rachel," Because you’re not finished yet and I won’t have it! Greens do
not quit!"
228,Joey, Greens? I’m a Tribbiani! And Tribbianis quit!
229,Rachel," Oh my God, wait did I—I just said Greens don’t quit
didn’t I? (Pause) (Angrily) Did I just say Greens don’t quit?!"
230,Joey, Yes! Yes! You did and you’re still yelling at me!
231,Rachel," No! No! No! I’m not yelling at you, I’m just yelling near you.
Oh God Joey, ohh I’m my father. Oh my God, this is horrible! I’ve been trying so
hard not to be my mother I did not see this comin’. Oh, Joey, I’m sorry.
I’m so sorry. I just wanted you to learn."
232,Joey," Well, hey I did learn."
233,Rachel, Really?
234,Joey, Yeah! Come on.
235,Rachel, Awww…
236,Joey," Yeah, it’s okay. I know what a mainsail is. (Points to it. It’s
the larger sail.) I know, I know to duck when the boom comes across. I-I know port is
right."
237,Rachel, Left.
238,Joey, Damnit!
240,Phoebe," Y’know, I bet it would actually make my grandmother very happy to
know that we’re trying to figure out her recipe. I bet she’s l-l-lookin’ up
at us and smiling right now."
241,Ross, Looking up?
242,Phoebe," Oh yeah—No, she was really nice to me, but she’s in hell for
sure."
243,Monica," Well, I’ve tried everything. I give up. I guess I’m not gonna
be the mom who makes the world’s best chocolate cookies. I do make the best duck
confit with broccoli rabe.  Kids love that right."
244,Ross," Aww, Pheeb, come on isn’t there any relative that would have the
recipe? What about, what about your sister?"
245,Phoebe," Oh no-no, no, I made a promise to myself that the next time I would talk
to Ursula would be over my dead body. And that’s not happening ‘til October 15th,
2032."
246,Ross," That’s the day you’re gonna die? See—darnit, I’ve got
shuffleboard that day."
247,Phoebe, That’s what you think.
248,Monica," Well, I mean what about friends of your grandmother’s?
Wouldn’t they have the recipe?"
249,Phoebe," Well, y’know I may have relatives in France who would know. My
grandmother said she got the recipe from her grandmother, Nesele Tolouse."
250,Monica, What was her name?
251,Phoebe, Nesele Toulouse.
252,Monica, Nestle Tollhouse?!
253,Phoebe," Oh, you Americans always butcher the French language."
254,Monica," (grabbing a bag of Nestle Tollhouse chocolate chips) Phoebe, is this
the recipe? (Tosses her the bag.)"
255,Phoebe, (reading the recipe on the back of the bag) Yes!! (Realizes.) Ohh.
256,Monica," I cannot believe that I just spent the last two days trying to figure
out the recipe and it was in my cupboard the whole time!"
257,Phoebe," I know! You see it is stuff like this which is why (Looking down)
you’re burning in hell!!"
259,Chandler," So you understand, I’d feel a lot more comfortable if you
didn’t tell people what happened. Y’know, I’m a little…I’m a
little embarrassed about it."
261,Chandler, What did you do when they found out?
264,Chandler, So I guess we wear swimsuits in here!
267,Rachel," Well Joey, I hate to admit it, your way of sailing is a lot more fun."
268,Joey," Yeah, yeah. Hey, why don’t you give a pull on that rope? (Points.)"
269,Rachel, Ohh we’re not sailing.
270,Joey, Just pull on it.
271,Rachel," All right. (She does so and it brings the cooler closer together.)
Hey-hey-hey!! (Sees what’s in the cooler.) Sandwiches!"
272,Joey, What else?
273,Rachel, (hands him one) Here you go.
274,Joey, Thank you.
275,Rachel," Oh wow! (She takes a bite, but holds the sandwich vertically so that the
stuff falls out.)"
276,Joey, What are you doing?
277,Rachel," Ohh, sorry."
278,Joey," What you—don’t hold it like that! You’re lettin’ all
the good stuff fall out."
280,Rachel, Ohh whoops.
281,Joey," Careful! You’re wasting good pastrami! (Gasps.) Oh my God! I’m my
dad!"
5,Joey," (laughing and turning off the TV) So, what did you guys think?"
7,Monica," (on phone) Hello? (Listens) Hold on please. Joey, it’s your mom.
(Hands him the phone.)"
8,Chandler, It’s your mommy. It’s your mommy.
9,Ross, Ohhhh…
10,Rachel, That’s nice.
11,Joey," (on phone) Mom, so what did you think? (He walks away allowing the gang a
chance to figure out what they’re gonna say.)"
12,Rachel, Well that was umm…Okay.
13,Ross, It wasn’t the best.
14,Chandler, That was one of the worse things ever. And not just on TV.
15,Monica, Wh-what are we gonna tell him?
16,Ross," Well, the lighting was okay."
17,Rachel," Ohh no you don’t! You got lighting last time, lighting is mine!"
18,Monica, And I have costumes.
19,Ross," Oh great! That means I’m stuck with, ""So, we were watching you
in there (Points to the TV) and you were sittin’ right here! Whoa!"""
21,Rachel, What are you gonna do Pheebs?
22,Phoebe," I don’t know. I don’t know. I can’t lie to him again. Oh
no I—no! I’m just gonna press my breasts up against him."
23,Chandler, And say nothing?
24,Phoebe," Uh-huh, yeah that’s right."
25,Joey," (hangs up the phone) Wow! Well, my folks really liked it! So what-what did
you guys think? (Phoebe smiles, walks up to him, and presses her breasts against him.) It
wasn’t that good."
28,Monica," Phoebe, do you think that your favorite animal says much about you?"
29,Phoebe, What? You mean behind my back?
30,Rachel," (entering, excitedly) Oh! Hi you guys, oh my God! You’ll never
gonna believe happened to me today! I am sitting in my office and…"
31,Joey," (entering from bathrooms excitedly) You guys! You guys! You’re not
gonna believe what my agent just told me!"
32,Rachel, Joey! Kinda in the middle of a story here!
33,Joey," Ooh, sorry. Sorry. You finish, go."
34,Rachel," Okay, so anyway I’m sittin’ in my office and guess who walks
in."
35,Joey, I’m gonna be on two TV shows!
37,Rachel, Joey!
38,Joey," Oh, you weren’t finished?"
39,Rachel," Yeah! Guess who walks into my office is the end of my story. (To Monica
and Phoebe) It was Ralph Lauren! (Monica and Phoebe gasp) Ralph Lauren walked into my
office!"
40,Joey," Uh Rach, if you’re gonna start another story, at least let me finish
mine."
41,Rachel, It’s the same story.
42,Joey," (groans in disgust) Wow, it’s really long."
43,Rachel," (ignoring him) Anyway, Ralph just came in to tell me that he’s so
happy with my work that he wants me to be the new merchandising manager for polo retail."
44,Monica, Still get a discount on wedding dresses?
45,Rachel, Yeah!
46,Monica, I’m so happy for you!
47,Joey," Well, these really are the days of our lives."
48,Monica, What?!
49,Joey," Well, since you ask. They want me back on Days of Our Lives!"
50,Phoebe, (gasps) Oh God!
51,Rachel, I got—I get a big pay raise!
52,Phoebe, Oh hey!
53,Joey," I’ll be playing Drake Remoray’s twin brother, Stryker!"
54,Monica, Oooh!
55,Rachel, I get to hire my own assistant!
57,Joey," (jumps up) Well—I got a head rush from standing up to fast right
there."
59,Rachel, (reading the resume) And you were at this job for four years?
61,Rachel," Okay, well this is all very impressive Hilda, um I just have one last
question for you. Uh, how did I do? Was this okay?"
63,Rachel," I’ve never interviewed anyone before. I’ve actually never had
anyone work for me before. Although when I was a kid, we did have a maid, but this
is-this isn’t the same thing. "
65,Rachel," No. Yeah, and I know that. All right, well thank you so much for coming
in it was nice to meet you."
67,Rachel, All right. (Hilda exits) I’m a total pro!
70,Rachel," (seeing him) Wow! H-umm! Hi! Yes, uh I’m sorry the models are
actually down the hall."
72,Rachel," Really?! (Taking his resume) Okay well then, all right, well just have a
seat there. Umm, so what’s—what is—what’s your name?"
74,Rachel," Uh-huh, go on."
76,Rachel," That’s your whole name, okay of course it is! Okay, well
let’s-let’s just have a look-see here. (Looking at his resume)"
78,Rachel," Oh come on, what are you talking about? You’ve got three years
painting houses. Two whole summers at T.G.I. Friday’s, come on!"
80,Rachel," Okay, hold on just a second. (She grabs a camera out of the desk and
takes his picture.) I’m sorry, it’s for human resources, everybody has to do it.
Could you just stand up please?"
82,Chandler," No-no-no-no. (Waves him away as Monica and Phoebe enter whispering to
each other.) Hey! (Monica shushes him.)"
83,Phoebe," (To Monica) Anyway, I should go. Okay, bye."
84,Monica, (To Chandler) Hey sweetie.
85,Chandler," Hi sweetie. So, what was with all the whispering?"
86,Monica, I can’t tell you. It’s a secret.
87,Chandler," Secret? Married people aren’t supposed to have secrets between
one another. We have too much love and respect for one another."
88,Monica, Awww. (Kisses him.) But still no.
89,Chandler," No I’m serious, we should tell each other everything. I do
not have any secrets from you."
90,Monica," Really? Okay, so why don’t you tell me what happened to Ross Junior
year at Disneyland?"
91,Chandler," Oh no-no, I can’t do that."
92,Monica," If you tell me, I’ll tell you what Phoebe said."
93,Chandler, Okay.
94,Monica, Okay.
95,Chandler," So, Ross and I are going to Disneyland and we stop at this
restaurant for tacos. And when I say restaurant, I mean a guy, a hibachi, and the trunk of
his car. So Ross has about 10 tacos. And anyway, we’re on Space Mountain and
Ross starts to feel a little iffy."
96,Monica, Oh my God. He threw up?
97,Chandler," No, he visited a little town south of throw up. (Monica laughs
hysterically.) So what was Phoebe’s secret?"
98,Monica," Oh, Nancy Thompson from Phoebe’s old massage place is getting
fired."
99,Chandler, That’s it?! I gave up my Disneyland story for that?
100,Monica, That’s right! You lose sucker!! (Pause) Please still marry me.
102,Rachel," Chandler, you have an assistant right?"
103,Chandler," (angrily) Did she call? You-you told her I was sick right? Always tell
her I am sick!"
104,Rachel," No, I-I just don’t know how you decide who to hire. I mean
I’ve got it narrowed down to two people. One of them has great references and a lot
of experience and then there’s this guy…"
105,Chandler, What about him?
106,Rachel," I love him. He’s so pretty I wanna cry! I don’t know what to
do. Tell me what to do."
107,Phoebe," Come on you know what to do! You hire the first one! You don’t hire
an assistant because they’re cute, you hire them because they’re qualified."
108,Rachel," Uh-huh. No, I hear what you’re saying and-and-and that makes a lot
of sense but can I just say one more thing? (Takes out his picture.) Look how pretty!"
109,Phoebe," Let’s see. (Looking at the picture) Oh my God! Oh… But no! No!
You can’t-you can’t hire him, because that—it’s not professional. Umm,
this is for me (The picture) yes? Thanks. (Puts it in her pocket.)"
110,Rachel," Okay you’re right. I’ll hire Hilda tomorrow. Dumb old perfect
for the job Hilda!"
111,Chandler," Let me see this guy. (Phoebe hands him the picture.) W-H-Wow!
Don’t show this to Monica! And don’t tell her about the W-H-Wow!"
114,Joey, Hey Terry!
116,Joey," It’s been a while, huh? Wow, it’s funny these halls look smaller
then they used to."
118,Joey, So! Stryker Remoray huh? When do you want me to start?
120,Joey, Okay.
122,Joey," (looking between the pages and him) Audition? I thought you were gonna
offer me the part."
124,Joey," Well, I was Dr. Drake Remoray, Stryker’s twin brother. I mean, who
looks more me than me right?"
126,Joey," Y’know Terry, I-I don’t really need to do this. I got my
own cable TV series, (Pause) with a robot."
128,Joey," Well. I guess you think you’re pretty special huh? Sittin’ up
here in your fancy small hall building. Makin’ stars jump through hoops for ya, huh?
Well y’know what? (Throws the script away) This is one star who’s hoop…
This is a star that the hoop—this hoop—I was Dr. Drake Remoray!"
130,Rachel, Hi! Tag. What are you doing here?
132,Rachel, Kinda.
134,Rachel," Oh-ohh, thank you."
136,Rachel, Well…
138,Rachel, But I hired you!
140,Rachel, Yeah! You-you got the job! You’re my new assistant!
142,Rachel, Yeah!
144,Rachel," Me either. Umm, all right, first thing I need you to do is go downstairs
and find a women named Hilda and tell her to go home."
146,Chandler, Hey.
147,Monica," Hey! Good, you’re home!"
148,Chandler," Oh it’s always nicer to here than, ""Aw crap! You
again!"""
149,Monica, Hey baby. (Kisses him.)
150,Chandler, Hey.
151,Monica, I made you a surprise.
152,Chandler, Oh yeah?
153,Monica," Yeah, tacos! Ever since you told me that story I’ve had such a
craving for them."
154,Chandler, Did you not understand the story?
155,Ross, (entering) Hey!
156,Chandler, Hey! What’s up?
157,Monica, Ross!
158,Ross," Oh, nothin’ much. Just trying to figure out what I’m gonna do
for dinner."
159,Chandler, Huh.
160,Ross," (notices the table) Hey—Ooh! What’s-what’s that, dinner
stuff? You making dinner?"
161,Chandler, No! (The oven dings.) Shhh!
162,Ross, What you got over there? Tacos?
163,Monica," No! No. They’re umm… They’re just uh…ground beef
smileys. (Holding up one of the shells.)"
164,Ross," Uhh, those are tacos."
165,Monica, Excuse me Mr. Mexico.
166,Ross," Eh, either way I’ll pass. (Quietly to Chandler) I still can’t
eat those. (Monica is getting something out of the fridge and starts laughing.)
What’s so funny?!"
167,Monica, (trying not to laugh) I’m not laughing. 
169,Ross, (To Chandler) You told her!
170,Chandler," Nancy Thompson’s getting fired! (Monica slaps him on the
shoulder.)"
171,Ross," (To Monica) Look, okay-okay I had food poisoning! It’s not like I
choose to do it! It’s not like—It’s not like I said, ""Umm, what would
make this ride more fun?!"""
172,Monica," You’re right. I mean I’m sorry. Yeah, I shouldn’t be
laughing. I should be laying down papers for you! (Runs off laughing which gets Chandler
laughing.)"
173,Ross, (To Chandler) How could you tell her?!
174,Chandler," I had too okay?! We’re getting married! Married couples
can’t keep secrets from one another!"
175,Ross, Oh really? Well I-I guess Monica should know about Atlantic City.
176,Chandler, Du-ude!
177,Monica, (running up to Ross) What happened in Atlantic City?!
178,Ross," Well, Chandler and I are in a bar…"
179,Chandler," Did you not hear me say, ""Du-ude?!"""
180,Ross," And this girl is making eyes at Chandler, okay? So after awhile he-he goes
over to her and uh, after a minute or two, I see them kissing. Now, I know what
you’re thinking, Chandler’s not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes
out with girls, and you’re right, Chandler’s not the type of guy who just goes
to bars and makes out with…girls."
181,Monica, (To Chandler) You kissed a guy?!! Oh my God.
182,Chandler," In my defense, it was dark and he was a very pretty guy."
183,Ross," Oh Mon, I laughed so hard…"
184,Chandler," Ho-ho, so hard we had to throw out your underwear again?"
185,Ross," Whatever dude, you kissed a guy."
188,Rachel, Hi!
189,Joey, Hey.
190,Phoebe," Hey—Ooh, how’s Hilda? Is she working out?"
191,Rachel," Ohh, my new assistant is working out, yes."
192,Joey, Was she happy you gave her the job?
193,Rachel," Oh, my-my new assistant has very happy that I hired my new assistant."
195,Joey," (on phone) Hello? (Listens) Oh hey! Can you, can you hang on a second? (To
Phoebe and Rachel) It’s the producers over at Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E. can you excuse me
for a minute? (On phone) Hey, funny you should call. I was just looking over next
week’s script. (Listens) Canceled?! (Listens) Like they’re taking it off the
air? (Listens) Ohh. (Listens) All right, see you Monday. (Listens) We’re not even
shootin’ them anymore?!! (Listens) All right, bye! (Hangs up) They canceled Mac and
C.H.E.E.S.E!"
196,Phoebe, Sorry.
197,Rachel, I’m sorry Joey.
198,Joey, Why would they do that?! It was a good show right?!
201,Chandler," You wanna tell secrets?! Okay! Okay! In college, Ross used to wear leg
warmers!"
202,Ross," All right! All right! Chandler entered a Vanilla Ice look-a-like contest
and won!"
203,Chandler, Ross came in forth and cried!
204,Monica, Oh my God! (Laughing)
205,Ross," Oh, is that funny?! Oh, you-you find that funny?! Well maybe Chandler
should know some of your secrets too!"
206,Monica, I-I already told him everything! (Threateningly) You shush!!
207,Ross," Once Monica was sent to her room without dinner, so she ate the macaroni
off a jewelry box she’d made."
208,Monica," Ross used to stay up every Saturday night to watch Golden
Girls!"
209,Ross, Monica couldn’t tell time ‘til she was 13!
210,Monica, It’s hard for some people!
211,Chandler, (To Monica) Of course it is. (Mouths to Ross) Wow—whoa!
212,Monica, Chandler one time wore my underwear to work!
213,Chandler, Hey!!!
214,Monica," Ohh, I’m sorry I couldn’t think of anymore for Ross!"
215,Ross," Ohh! Ohh! In college, Chandler got drunk and slept with the lady who
cleaned our dorm!"
216,Chandler, That was you!
217,Ross," Whatever dude, you kissed a guy."
219,Joey," How could this happen to me?! Yesterday I had two TV shows! Today,
I got nothin’!"
220,Rachel," Well wait a minute, what happened to Days of Our Lives?"
221,Joey," Uh, well they might be a little mad at me over there."
222,Phoebe, What happened?
223,Joey, Well maybe I got a little upset and maybe I told them where they could go.
224,Rachel," Joey, why would you do that?"
225,Joey, Because they wanted me to audition!
226,Phoebe, You! An actor?! That’s madness!
229,Rachel," Tag? (He turns and looks at her.) Hi, who was that?"
231,Rachel, Really? (Giggles.)
233,Phoebe, Hi!
235,Phoebe, You must be Hilda.
236,Rachel," Yeah, this is Tag. Tag, this is Phoebe. Phoebe, can I see you for a
second? (Goes into office.)"
238,Phoebe," Oh, you like that? You should hear my phone number."
239,Rachel," (grabbing Phoebe) Okay. We’ll be right back. (They go into her
office and she closes the door.)"
240,Phoebe, So you hired yourself a little treat did ya?
241,Rachel," All right I know, I know how it looks Pheebs, but I’m telling
you…"
242,Phoebe, But-but you know you cannot get involved with your assistant.
243,Rachel," Yes, I know that. I know that. And I know that hiring him was probably
not the smartest thing that I’ve ever done. But I’m telling you, from this
moment on I swear this is strictly professional. (There’s a knock on the door.) Yes? "
246,Rachel, Hi!
248,Rachel, Gay? Yeah. (Kathy leaves dejectedly.)
250,Joey, Hey! Terry.
252,Joey," Wait! Terry! Wait—Look—Wait I-I… Look, I’m really
sorry about before. I was an idiot thinking I’m too big to audition for you. You
gotta give me another chance."
254,Joey," Wait! Terry! Please! Look, I just lost my other job. Okay? You have no
idea how much I need this. Please, help me out, for old times sake."
261,Joey, (jumping up and removing the bandages) I’m back baby! Ha-ha-ha!
263,Monica," Y’know, in my defense, umm there was no glitter on the macaroni and
very little glue."
264,Ross," And in my defense, the cleaning lady came on to me!"
265,Chandler, (To Monica) You have no trouble telling time now right?
266,Monica, No!
267,Chandler, Quick! What time is it?! (Holds his watch in front of her face.)
268,Monica," I don’t know! Time to kiss a guy maybe?! (Ross laughs.) What are
you laughing at Pampers? (He stops laughing and glares at her.)"
269,Chandler," Y’know when I said that because we’re getting married that
we should share everything and not have any secrets? "
270,Monica, Yeah?
271,Chandler, Yeah that was stupid. Let’s not do that.
272,Monica," Ohh, absolutely."
273,Ross," And! We should keep all the stuff uh, we told each other secret from
everybody else."
274,Monica," Yeah, definitely!"
275,Ross," Okay, (gets up) if you’ll excuse me, I-I’m gonna go hang out
with some people who don’t know the Space Mountain story."
276,Monica," Then, I’d steer clear of Phoebe."
277,Ross," Man! (Monica mouths, ""I’m sorry."")"
278,Chandler," Yeah, and not that you would, but I wouldn’t hang out
with…all the guys in my office."
282,Rachel, (noticing him) Hi! (Puts the pictures away.)
284,Rachel," Well yeah, sure, what’s up?"
286,Rachel, Oh really?!
288,Rachel," Oh, did you not want people to know that?"
290,Rachel, Why’s that?
292,Rachel," Ohh, you can say. Come on, I don’t want you to feel like you
can’t tell me things. (Motions for him to sit down.)"
294,Rachel, ‘Kay.
296,Rachel, Yeah.
298,Rachel," (Pause) Yeah, she’s gay."
0,Chandler, Hey.
1,Monica, What’s the matter?
2,Chandler, Someone on the subway licked my neck! Licked my neck!!
3,Phoebe, Oh Willie’s still alive!
4,Chandler, What are you guys doing?
5,Monica," Oh, my mom called, they’re gonna run our engagement announcement in
the local paper, so we’re looking for a good picture of us."
6,Chandler," Oooh, I’m afraid that does not exist."
7,Monica," That’s not true, there are great pictures of us!"
8,Chandler," No, there are great pictures of you standing next to a guy who’s
going like this… (Makes what can only be described as a toothy frown. Henceforth,
this shall be known as The Face.)"
9,Phoebe," Oh my God! That’s the creep that you’re with at the Statue
of Liberty."
10,Chandler," I don’t know what it is, I just can’t take a good picture."
11,Monica," (looking at one) Oh, here’s a great one."
12,Chandler," Yeah, I’m not in that."
13,Monica," I know, but look at me all tan."
14,Phoebe," Hey, why don’t you guys go, get portraits done by a professional
photographer."
15,Monica," That’s a good idea! I bet they have one of those wind machines!
Y’know… (Does the whole hair blowing in the wind model type poses.)"
16,Phoebe," Yeah that’s great! Next to that, Chandler won’t look so
stupid."
17,Monica, Chandler what do you say?
18,Chandler," All right, but I should warn you, I’m not going. I’m going.
(Does The Face while saying that last part.)"
21,Ross," (To Chandler) Dude, that reverse lay-up! Oh…"
22,Chandler, How about those three pointers?
23,Ross, Amazing!
24,Chandler," And those guys were this (Doing the standard ""This
Close"" gesture) close to lettin’ us play this time too."
26,Rachel," Hey look-look, Phoebe’s talking to uh, Cute Coffeehouse Guy."
27,Ross," Oh, you guys call him Cute Coffeehouse Guy, we call him Hums While He
Pees."
28,Chandler," Yes, and we call Ross Lingers In The Bathroom."
29,Phoebe," (returning) Hey you guys, Hums While He Pees just asked me out!"
30,Rachel," Hey, I thought that guy was married."
31,Phoebe, He is! But he’s getting divorced—Ross! Maybe you know him.
32,Ross, It’s not a club.
33,Rachel," Phoebe, if this guy’s going through a divorce, is it such a good
idea to start going out with him?"
34,Ross," Hey, divorced men are not bad men!"
35,Chandler, They have that on the napkins at the club.
36,Rachel," Oh, I gotta get back to work."
37,Phoebe, You don’t have to be back for a half-hour!
38,Rachel," Yeah but, my assistant Tag does sit-ups in the office during lunch. Ohh!
I could just spread him on a cracker."
39,Chandler," Rach, if you have a crush on this guy, why would you hire him? I mean
y’know you can’t date him right?"
40,Rachel," Oh no, I know that. I know that. Although, we made a joke that we spend
so much time together he should call me his work wife."
41,Ross," Soon he’ll be able to call you, that lady he knew who got fired."
42,Rachel," I am not gonna get fired, because I’m not gonna act on it."
43,Phoebe, So you wouldn’t mind if he was dating someone else?
44,Rachel," Why? Is he? He is! Isn’t he? He’s dating that slut in
marketing!"
45,Ross, Maybe I should open a divorced men’s club.
46,Chandler, Dude that is so sad.
47,Ross, I could put uh-uh a basketball court in the back.
48,Chandler, Could I play?
50,Rachel," Oh, no sit-ups today Tag?"
52,Rachel," Oh, well drop and give me ten more!"
54,Rachel," Uh, I-I had a drink with lunch. Did those cost reports come in?"
56,Rachel," Oh, great could you make me four copies of those?"
59,Rachel," (startled) Ahh, hi! Hi! Melissa, what’s up? I’m just uh, about
to umm, go out to the store to get some stuff to put in my backpack. Y’know, like
dried fruit and granola and stuff. What’s up? (She has put on the backpack.)"
61,Rachel, No. Why?
63,Rachel, Really?! Got a little crush on Tag there do ya?
65,Rachel," Okay, whoa-whoa easy there Melissa! This ain’t a locker room, okay?
But, y’know I remember him saying that-that he had plans tonight."
67,Rachel," Oh yeah. All right, back to work."
69,Rachel," Yeah Melissa, I don’t want to be known as the uh, office bitch, but
I will call your supervisor."
73,Chandler, Okay. (Does The Face.)
75,Chandler," No, I am."
76,Monica," Chandler, listen to me sweetie, I know you can do this. Okay? You have a
beautiful smile."
77,Chandler," I do? (He smiles, beautifully.)"
78,Monica," Yeah! (They turn to the camera, and Chandler does The Face again.) All
right, maybe you don’t have to smile. Let’s try something else. Let’s try
umm, try looking sexy."
79,Chandler," Okay. (You’ll have to see it, I can’t describe the face he
makes, but it isn’t good.)"
80,Monica, Or not.
82,Rachel, Hi Joey! What are you doing here?
83,Joey," Uhh, well I’ve got an audition down the street and I spilled sauce
all over the front of my shirt. (Removes his hand to reveal a huge sauce stain.) You got
an extra one?"
84,Rachel," Yeah, sure. Umm…here. (Hands him one.)"
85,Joey," Great. (He doesn’t like it.) You got anything that’s not Ralph
Lauren?"
86,Rachel," Yeah, I don’t think so Joe."
87,Joey," All right, I guess this will be fine."
88,Rachel," Hey, listen umm, what-what are you doing tonight?"
89,Joey," Nothing, why?"
90,Rachel, How would you feel about taking out my assistant Tag? I’ll pay.
91,Joey," Huh, Rach I got to say it’s gonna take a lot of money for me to go
out on a date with a dude."
92,Rachel, I’m not asking you to go on a date with him!
93,Joey, Really? ‘Cause I could kinda use the money.
94,Rachel," Joey, just-just he-he’s new in town and I know he doesn’t have
any guy friends. Just take him to like a ball game or something. I’ll really
appreciate it."
95,Joey," Yeah, okay."
96,Rachel, Yeah?
97,Joey," Sure, no problem. (Sees something.) Ooh—Hey, donuts!"
98,Rachel, Yeah!
99,Joey," Okay. (He grabs a jelly donut, takes a bite, and guess what he spills all
over himself. He tries to clean it up and smears it all over the shirt.)"
101,Monica," I know. Let’s try a look…of far off…wonderment. Okay,
we’ll-we’ll gaze into our future and we’ll think about our marriage and the
days to come. (Chandler is still not getting it.) Chandler! What is the matter with your
face?! I mean this picture is supposed to say ""Geller and Bing to be married,""
not ""Local woman saves drowning moron!"" (The photographer laughs.) Hey!
Don’t laugh at him! He’s my drowning moron!"
102,Chandler, Aww! (Smiles.)
103,Monica, That’s it! Take it! Take it! Take it!
106,Ross," I like this one. (Points to it.) It seems to say, ""I love you and
that’s why I have to kill you."""
107,Monica," They can’t all be bad. (To Chandler) Find the one where you make
your bedroom eyes. Ohh, there it is."
108,Chandler, Oh my God! Those are my bedroom eyes?! Why did you ever sleep with me?
109,Monica, Do you really want to pull at that thread?
111,Phoebe, I’m having a really good time!
113,Phoebe," Ohh. No that’s okay, he’s a friend."
115,Phoebe," Yeah, I… Well y’know I-I mean I missed the-the semi-finals, so
I’d just be lost."
117,Phoebe," Okay, don’t freak out. I’ll go."
119,Phoebe," Okay, I know. Hold on. (She walks over to the couch.) Hey Ross?"
120,Ross, Yeah?
121,Phoebe," Yeah, umm that’s Whitney (Points), Kyle’s ex-wife out there,
now do you think that you can y’know divert her so that we can slip out?"
122,Ross, What?! No!
123,Phoebe," Well okay but I have two tickets to the ballroom dance finals. (She
holds up the tickets that Kyle gave her.)"
124,Ross," Look, I don’t think so Pheebs. (Pause) All right, I’ll do it.
But just because you’re a friend. (Grabs the tickets and heads to divert Whitney.)"
126,Phoebe, Hi Ginger.
127,Ross, All right! I want my key back!
128,Phoebe, I don’t have it!
129,Ross, It’s right there! (Points to her hand.)
130,Phoebe," Ugh, okay Sherlock! (Hands over the key.)"
131,Ross," Look, I’m sorry but you-you-you better go Pheebs."
132,Phoebe," All right, well I just wanted to say thank you though for diverting
Kyle’s ex. "
133,Ross, Oh yeah—No—You’re welcome. We’ll talk about it later.
134,Phoebe, Okay.
136,Ross, Hi Whitney.
138,Ross, Yep. (Phoebe slams the door shut.) Okay.
139,Phoebe," (To Ross) Kyle’s ex-wife? You were supposed to divert her not date
her!"
140,Ross," (opens the door and to Whitney) Hi! I’m sorry, but can you give me a
second while I talk to this woman, who by the way did not spend the night."
142,Ross," Okay. (Closes the door.) (To Phoebe) I did divert her and we ended
up having a great time! Okay?"
143,Phoebe, Watching ballroom dancing?
144,Ross, Yes! That’s where we realized we were both super cool people!
145,Phoebe," Well look-look, okay Ross, Kyle just told me some really bad
stuff about her."
146,Ross, Like what?
147,Phoebe," Like she’s really mean, and she’s over critical,
and-and—No! She will paint a room a really bright color without even checking
with you!"
148,Ross, Okay.
149,Phoebe, And! She uses sex as a weapon!
150,Ross," Fine! Thank you for warning me. At breakfast I’ll be on full alert
for room painting and sex weapons."
151,Phoebe, You’re still gonna go out with her?!
152,Ross, Yeah!
153,Phoebe," Well, didn’t you just hear what I said?!"
154,Ross," Pheebs come on! I mean, consider the source! Of course her
ex-husband’s gonna say that stuff. Now, if you’ll excuse me…"
155,Phoebe, (interrupting him) No listen to me! She is crazy!
157,Phoebe, You see? Nothing is good enough for her!
160,Rachel," Hi Tag! Hey, so did you have fun with uh, with Joey last night?"
162,Rachel, Ohh that’s nice.
164,Rachel, Wo-women? You mean like old women?
166,Rachel, (Pause) Oh.
168,Rachel," That’s great! Wow man, so Joey must’ve really taught you some
stuff huh?"
170,Rachel, Yeah?
175,Joey," See? That’s a great smile! Easy. Natural. Now, pretend I have a
camera. (Chandler immediately does The Face.) You’re changing it!"
176,Chandler, I can’t help it!
177,Joey," All right, all right, all right, all right, you wanna know what I do when
I take resume shots?"
178,Chandler, Borrow money from me?
179,Joey," Okay, first—first of all, you want to make it look spontaneous. I
look down (Looks down), look down, keep looking down; then I look up. (Looks up and
smiles.) See? All right, now you try. Look down (Chandler looks down), you’re looking
down, keep looking down…"
180,Chandler, Why is there jelly on your shoe?
181,Joey, I had a donut. (Chandler nods.)
182,Rachel, (entering) Hi!
183,Joey, Hey!
184,Chandler, Hey!
185,Rachel," So uh, heard you had some fun with Tag last night."
186,Joey, Yeah! That guy’s all right!
187,Rachel, Yeah and you had fun teaching him how to be all Joey.
188,Joey, What?
189,Rachel," Y’know, all the women."
190,Joey," Hey well, you can’t teach someone to be good with women. Y’know,
that’s why I never had any luck with Chandler."
191,Chandler, (Pause) I’m right here!
192,Rachel," All right, would-would you mind just not going out with him again? Okay,
just the idea of you and he and all these women, it’s just—And I know he’s
my assistant and I can’t date him—but it just bothers me, all right?!"
193,Joey," Hey! No-no-no-no, you can’t take him away from me! I got a great
partner to pick up girls with! Finally!!"
194,Chandler, I’m still right here!
195,Rachel," All right, will you, will you at least tell him how hollow and
unsatisfying this, dating tons of women thing is!"
196,Joey, (shocked) What?!
197,Rachel," I just don’t want him to meet anybody until I am over my
crush—And I will get over it. It’s-it’s not like I love him, it’s just
physical! But—I mean I get crushes like this all the time! I mean hell, I had a crush
on you when I first met ya!"
198,Joey," I know, Monica told me."
199,Chandler," Did you have a crush on me, when you first met me?"
200,Rachel, Yeah. Sure. (Joey nods his head questioningly and Rachel nods no.)
201,Chandler," Can you people not see me?! (He waves his arms around to get their
attention.)"
202,Rachel," (To Joey) So, will you talk to him?"
203,Joey, I don’t know Rach.
204,Rachel," Oh, come on! I’ll give you ten free Ralph Lauren shirts."
205,Joey, One! (Pause.) No ten! You said ten! You can’t take that back!
208,Joey," I don’t know. You uh, you got something for me?"
211,Joey, Ten. Okay. Now Tag there’s such a thing as to many women.
213,Joey," Yeah, for you!"
215,Monica, (seeing him approach) Hey! There you are!
216,Chandler, There I am!
217,Monica, Are you okay?
218,Chandler," Yeah, Joey said I uh, I needed to relax so he gave me an
antihistamine."
219,Monica, What?!
220,Chandler," Yeah, and then I fell asleep on the subway and went all the way to
Brooklyn. Brooklyn is f-far!!"
221,Monica," Chandler, what were you thinking?"
222,Chandler," I don’t know, but don’t worry, don’t worry, because I
know how to take a picture now. (They get ready) Okay, see? Look down (Looks down), look
down, look down… (He falls asleep.)"
223,Monica, Chandler?
224,Chandler, (awakens) Yeah! (Looks up and does The Face.)
226,Phoebe, Hi.
227,Ross, Hi.
228,Phoebe," So, how are things going with crazy? Has she cooked your rabbit yet?"
229,Ross," Listen, you are hearing one side of the story, okay—and F.Y.I
she must’ve shown Kyle over 30 paint samples before she painted that room! And his
response to each one was, ""I don’t give a tiny rat’s ass."""
230,Phoebe," Yeah well, maybe she should’ve spent a little less time decorating
and a little more time in the bedroom."
231,Ross," Well, I don’t think we are gonna have that problem, but maybe
that’s just because I am not emotionally unavailable!"
232,Phoebe, You think he’s emotionally unavailable?
233,Ross, I think he can be.
234,Phoebe," Well, maybe he wouldn’t be she didn’t bring the office home
every night!"
235,Ross," Well, excuse her for knowing what she wants to do with her life!"
236,Phoebe," Yeah well, she certainly knew what she was doing New Year’s Eve
1997."
237,Ross," (angrily) I knew you were gonna throw that in my face!! That
was three years ago! She apologized and she apologized! What more do you want?!!"
238,Phoebe, (gets up and starts to leave) We want the last six years back!!
239,Ross," So do we!! So do we!! (Ross notices a couple has been staring at them.)
I’m sorry you had to see that."
242,Rachel," Hi! (He hands her, her mail) Thanks, hey so uh what’d you do last
night?"
244,Rachel, Oh yeah? Another night of birdogging the chickas?
246,Rachel, Wow! I did not see that coming.
248,Rachel," Oh no, yes I do! I do! I mean, come on go on, you were, you were saying
I am happier when uh, y’know?"
250,Rachel, Really?
252,Rachel, Sp-spoil?
254,Rachel, Uh-huh.
256,Rachel," Well, I-I’m startin’ too."
258,Rachel, Yes! Hell yes!
260,Rachel, Okay.
262,Rachel, I’d love to!
264,Rachel," (panics, turns around, picks up the phone, and pretend to talk on it)
Hello?! (Listens) Oh, yeah! (To Tag) This is gonna be a while. Excuse me. (Tag leaves and
she closes the door behind him, disgustedly.) Yeah!"
266,Ross, My God!
267,Phoebe," Oh, I’m sorry. Is that annoying? And speaking about being selfish
in bed, how’s Whitney?"
268,Ross," Well maybe she wouldn’t have to be selfish in bed if someone else
knew where everything was!"
269,Phoebe, Oh he knows! (Quietly) For the most part.
273,Phoebe, Both of you together?
274,Ross, Wh-what’s up?
277,Ross, Oh just say it Kyle!
279,Phoebe, What about her whining and her constant need for attention?!
281,Phoebe," Oh right, because you’re so capable of change."
282,Ross," (To Whitney) Y’know, he hums when he pees!"
284,Ross," It makes him miss the bowl, but whatever."
286,Ross," That’s all right, we-we don’t need you. In fact, hey I’m
over it already."
287,Phoebe," Yeah, and y’know what? I don’t give a tiny rat’s ass."
289,Ross," (To Phoebe) I’m sorry. Ugh, Pheebs, you were, you were right about
her. Y’know, she did try to use sex as a weapon! Yeah, I hurt my back a
little."
290,Phoebe," Oh. Y’know, he hums while he does other stuff to."
291,Ross," Yeah, were better off without them."
292,Phoebe," And y’know, even if they break up again, you’d better not let
him in your sad men’s club!"
293,Ross, Divorced men’s club.
294,Phoebe," Potato, Potaato. (She’s pronounces potato with the both the short
and long As.)"
297,Monica, Hey guys check it out! My mom sent me the paper!
298,Phoebe," Ooh, let’s see it!"
299,Chandler, Ahhh.
300,Monica, Okay. (She opens it up and shows it to them.)
301,Chandler," Oh yeah, that looks good."
302,Phoebe," You guys make a very attractive couple. (The camera cuts to a
shot of the picture and we see that Monica is posing with Joey instead of Chandler.)"
303,Joey," Yeah, we look great together."
304,Monica," Yeah, we really do!"
305,Chandler, Okay.
306,Monica, Wow! Imagine what our kids would look like!
307,Joey," Y’know, we don’t have to imagine."
308,Chandler, I’m marrying her.
309,Joey, We’ll just see.
0,Monica," Okay, the reason why I asked you guys out to brunch today is because I
have been doing some thinking about who should be my maid of honor."
1,Rachel," Oh my God! This is it! (She and Phoebe hold hands.) (To Phoebe) I really
hope it’s you!"
2,Phoebe, I hope it’s you.
3,Rachel, Me too!
4,Monica," First of all um, I love you both so much and you’re both so
important to me…"
5,Rachel," Okay, bla-bla-bla-bla!! Who is it?!"
6,Monica," Well umm, I was thinking that maybe we could come up with a system where
we trade of being maid of honor for each other. Like hypothetically, if Phoebe were
mine…"
7,Phoebe, Yes!!! Oh!!
8,Rachel, Hypothetically!
9,Phoebe, Still.
10,Monica, If Phoebe were my maid of honor…
11,Rachel, Uh-hmm.
12,Monica," Rachel would be Phoebe’s, I would be Rachel’s, that way we all
get to do it once and no one would get upset."
13,Rachel, Yeah that’s actually a pretty good idea.
14,Phoebe," Yeah, I’ll do that. So who gets to be yours?"
15,Monica," (laughs) Well that’s the best part. Umm, you guys get to
decide!"
16,Phoebe, Wh-why is that the best part?
17,Monica, Because then I don’t have to!
18,Rachel," Well of course we will help you decide! We will do anything we
can to help you! Now, I would like to make a toast, to the future Mrs. Chandler Bing (A
woman at the table behind them overhears Chandler’s name and starts listening
closer), my best friend, and truly one of the nicest people that…"
19,Monica, I’m really not deciding!
20,Rachel, Fine!
23,Monica, Yeah that’s right.
25,Phoebe," Aww, and good luck to you too! (To Monica and Rachel) What a nice lady!"
28,Chandler, Die Hard still great!
29,Joey," Yep. Hey, what do you say we make it a double feature?"
30,Chandler, What’d you rent?
31,Joey, Die Hard 2.
32,Chandler," (looking at the tape) Joey, this is Die Hard 1 again."
33,Joey," Oh, well we watch it a second time and its Die Hard 2!"
34,Ross," Joey, we just saw it!"
35,Joey, And?
36,Ross, And it’ll be cool to see it again! Yeah!
38,Ross," Dude, you didn’t say Die Hard. Is everything okay?"
39,Chandler," Yeah, I just got uh, got plans."
40,Ross," Well, John McLane had plans!"
41,Chandler," No, see the thing is I want to get out of here before Joey gets all
worked up and starts calling everybody bitch."
42,Joey, What are you talking about? Bitch.
44,Phoebe, Hey Rachel?
45,Rachel, Yeah?
46,Phoebe," Umm, when I get married will you be my maid of honor?"
47,Rachel, Really?!
48,Phoebe, Uh-hmm.
49,Rachel," Oh my God Phoebe! I mean I’m just—Wait a minute. If I’m
your maid of honor that means you are Monica’s."
50,Phoebe," Oh! Well, if that’s what you want…"
51,Rachel, Ohh! No way Phoebe! I want to be Monica’s!
52,Phoebe, But why does it even matter?!
53,Rachel, Why does it matter so much to you?!
54,Phoebe," Because this one is now! And-and it’s two of our best
friends! Who knows what you’re gonna marry!"
55,Rachel, What-what if I marry Ross—Or Joey?
56,Phoebe," (gasps) You wouldn’t! Okay look, Rachel I know you really want to
do this, but I-I’ve never been maid of honor to anyone before! And I know you’ve
done it at least twice!"
57,Rachel, Yeah but Phoebe…
58,Phoebe," And no, oh please, oh please let me finish. (Rachel stops talking.) Oh I
guess that was it."
59,Rachel," Okay. Okay. It’s—since you’ve never done it before you
can be Monica’s made of honor."
60,Phoebe," Oh, thank you so much! (They hug.) Okay."
61,Rachel, I’m gonna marry someone good y’know.
62,Phoebe, Oh I know.
63,Rachel," Better than Chandler. (Phoebe exhales as if to say, ""Like what
isn’t?"")"
65,Ross, What happened?!!
66,Joey," Well, I don’t know!!"
67,Ross, We fell asleep! That is all.
68,Joey," Yeah. Yep. Yeah. All right, well uh, I’d better go."
69,Ross, I think that would be best.
70,Joey," Yeah. All right, I’ll talk to you later."
71,Ross, Okay. But not about this!
72,Joey," No! Never! Never! (Pause, then Joey wants to shake Ross’s hand.) Bye."
73,Ross, No touch! No touch!
75,Monica," Yeah hey, a weird thing happened today whey I was at brunch. This woman
overheard that I was marrying you and-and then she…she wished me good luck."
76,Chandler, That’s sweet.
77,Monica," No, it’s more like a (sarcastically) good luck."
78,Chandler," So uh, what did this woman look like?"
79,Monica," She was like 30, dark hair, attractive."
80,Chandler," Well, is there any chance you were looking into a bright, shiny thing
called a mirror?"
81,Monica," Come on, was it somebody maybe you dated in college?"
82,Chandler," No, no I only dated two girls in college, both blonde, both not
attractive… (Thinks a little while.) Hold on one second; let me check this out. (He
gets up and grabs a photo album."
83,Monica, What are you doing?
84,Chandler," Well, let’s see… (Finding the picture he wants.) Okay uh, is
that her? (Pointing to the picture.)"
85,Monica, Oh my God yes! Who is she?
86,Chandler," Julie Grath, my camp girlfriend."
87,Monica, Did you break up with her?
88,Chandler," (pause) No, we’re still together. Yeah we went out for two
summers, and then I broke up with her."
89,Monica, Why?
90,Chandler," Well, ‘cause she came back the third summer and she’d gotten
really fa-aa-aw-ow…"
91,Monica, Fat?!
92,Chandler," I did not say fat! I said, ""Fa-aa-aw-ow…"""
93,Monica, You broke up with a girl because she was fat?!
94,Chandler," Yeah. Yeah, but it was a really, really long time ago! Does she still
feel bad?"
95,Monica," Well, apparently she does."
96,Chandler," Well, you know what they say, elephants never forget. (Monica is not
amused by that statement.) Seriously, good luck marrying me."
98,Joey, Hey! What’s going on?
99,Rachel, Phoebe is gonna be Monica’s maid of honor!
100,Joey," Hey! Well I hope it goes better than the last time you did it for that
girl downstairs, remember? (Phoebe glares at him.)"
101,Rachel, (shocked) You have been maid of honor before?!!
102,Phoebe, See? This is exactly why you shouldn’t lie!
103,Rachel, All right that’s it! I am maid of honor!
104,Phoebe," Na-uh, I am!"
105,Rachel, How come you are?!
106,Phoebe, Because I cared enough to lie!
107,Joey," Hey-hey-hey-hey, I can help you decide who should do it! Yeah, we could
have like uh, like an audition and see how you’d handle maid of honor type
situations."
108,Phoebe, What are you talking about?
109,Joey," Like when I want a job, I go to an audition and if I’m the best of
the people they see, they give me the part."
110,Phoebe," Okay, so after this audition, who decides who gets it?"
111,Joey," Oh uh, me and Ross can be the judges."
112,Phoebe," (To Rachel) Well, it’s better than us deciding."
113,Rachel," Oh, come on! This is crazy! Can’t we just flip a coin?!"
114,Phoebe, No! Coins hate me!
115,Rachel," Okay. Okay fine, y’know what? We will let Ross and Joey decide.
(Ross enters.) (In a sexy voice.) Hiiiii, Ross! Sweetie."
116,Phoebe," Hey there, you handsome thing. (Rachel and Phoebe exit.)"
117,Ross," Wow, this cologne really is every bit as good as Georgio. "
118,Joey, Hi.
119,Ross," Just uh, brought back your videos."
120,Joey," Uh hey look uh Ross, look I think we need to talk about before."
121,Ross, No! No we don’t!
122,Joey," Yes we do! Now look, that was the best nap I ever had!! "
123,Ross, I… I don’t know what you are talking about.
124,Joey, Come on! Admit it! That was the best nap you ever had!
125,Ross, I’ve had better.
126,Joey, Okay! When?!
127,Ross, All right! All right! It was the best nap ever!
128,Joey, Uh-huh!
129,Ross, I’ve said it! Okay?! But it’s over Joey!
130,Joey, I want to do it again.
131,Ross, We can’t do it again.
132,Joey, Why not?
133,Ross, Because it’s weird!
134,Joey, Fine! Do you want something to drink?
135,Ross," Sure, what do you got?"
136,Joey, Warm milk and Excedrin P.M. (Ross just leaves.)
139,Monica," Chandler! (Knocks on the door.) Chandler! I just figured out who you
are!"
140,Chandler, Can you figure out what I’m doing?
141,Monica, You’re Lewis Posin.
142,Chandler, Who?
143,Monica," Lewis Posin! He was my best friend in fifth grade, and-and then one day
I asked him to be my boyfriend and he said no. Do you know why?"
144,Chandler," Because you kept talking to him while he was trying to go to the
bathroom?!"
145,Monica," No! But because he thought I was to faaaaa…. (Chandler emerges,
without flushing by the way.) And every time I think about it, it makes me feel as bad as
I did in fifth grade! Y’know, I-I really think that you should apologize to Julie."
146,Chandler, What? Are you kidding? That was like 16 years ago.
147,Monica," No, I know. But y’know what? It would make me feel better if Lewis
apologized to me."
148,Chandler," Okay, I will do it. But I have to warn you; this may make me a better
person and that is not the man you feel in love with!"
150,Joey," Okay, all right, this is how it’s going to work. We’re gonna
give you hypothetical maid of honor situations and you will be scored on a scale of 1 to
10, 1 being the highest."
151,Ross," No, 10 is the highest."
152,Joey, Why is 10 the highest?
153,Ross," Because it’s the highest. (Joey shrugs his shoulders) Okay, Rachel
you’re up first. (Rachel stands up and gets ready.) Situation No. 1 You’re with
Monica, the wedding is about to start when Monica gets cold feet. Go! (Joey is playing the
part of Monica.)"
154,Joey, (crying) I don’t want to marry Chandler!
155,Rachel," Okay, uh…"
156,Joey, I’ve got cold feet.
157,Rachel, …it’s gonna be okay!
158,Joey," No, one man for the rest of my life? I don’t know if I can do it!
This means I’ll never get to sleep with Joey!"
159,Rachel," Look Monica, getting cold feet is very common. Y’know,
it’s-it’s just because of all the anticipation and you just have to remember
that you love Chandler. And also, I ran out on a wedding. You don’t get to keep the
gifts."
160,Joey," (out of his Monica character) Very good! Drawing on your own experience, I
like that!"
161,Rachel, Thanks!
162,Ross," Yes, very nice Rachel."
163,Rachel, Thank you judges.
164,Phoebe," Ugh, what a kiss ass."
165,Rachel, Oh!
166,Joey," Okay, Phoebe…"
167,Phoebe, Yes! Your honor?
168,Joey," We’re now in the ceremony, Monica is about to say, ""I do""
when her drunk uncle starts yelling. What do you do? Go!"
169,Ross," (playing the drunk uncle) When Monica was a little girl, I remember
that—(Phoebe screams and tackles him)—Ooh!! Ow! Very good!"
170,Phoebe, Oh!
171,Joey, Yes! Excellent! Perfect score!
172,Rachel, Wait a minute! She just made a scene in the middle of the ceremony!
173,Phoebe, Hey! Do you want do you want a little taste of Pheebs?!
174,Ross, It is time for you to give your maid of honor speech.
175,Rachel," Ohh, wait a minute, we haven’t pre…"
176,Ross, Go!
177,Rachel," Okay! Okay! Umm, Webster’s Dictionary defines marriage
as… (Ross and Joey start writing.) Okay!! Forget that! That sucks!! Okay, never mind!
Forget it! Umm, umm, okay, uh… I met, I-I met, I met Monica when we were just a
couple of six year olds and I became friends with Chandler when he was 25, although he
seemed like a six year old."
179,Rachel," Thank you. Thank you very much. Umm, I’ve known them separately and
I’ve known them together and-and to know them as a couple is to know that you are
truly in the presence of love. So I would like to raise my glass (Grabs a glass and holds
it up) to Monica and Chandler and the beautiful adventure they are about to embark upon
together. I can think of no two people better prepared for the journey."
180,Joey, Wow. (To Ross) Good speech.
181,Ross," Yeah, it really was!"
182,Rachel," Aw, thanks!"
183,Ross," Okay Phoebe, I guess you’re next (To Joey) although I really
don’t see the point."
184,Joey, Yeah.
185,Phoebe," Okay, I can’t believe that Monica and Chandler are getting married.
I remember talking about this day with Rachel while we were showering together, naked.
(Raises her glass and drinks.)"
187,Joey, And she’s back in the game.
189,Chandler," (she opens the door) Julie hi! Chandler Bing, I, I guess you remember
me."
191,Chandler," (To Monica) It’s a nickname, I’ll explain later."
192,Monica, It’s pretty clear.
193,Chandler," Ah, uh, I owe you a long overdue apology. I never should have broken
up with you because you were overweight."
195,Chandler," You-you-you didn’t know that. (Pause as she nods no.) Well, I
guess my work here is done!"
197,Joey," All right, well first of all I would like to say that you both performed
very well. Okay? You should be proud of yourselves. And-and I would also like to say that
in this competition there are no losers. Well, except for Rachel—Damnit!"
198,Phoebe, Really?! I won!
199,Rachel, What?!
200,Ross," I’m sorry Rach, it was, it was really close."
201,Rachel," Well then I demand a recount! (Hmm, I wonder where I’ve heard that
before.)"
202,Ross," Actually, it wasn’t that close."
203,Rachel," No! Y’know what? No! No! You thing was so stupid anyway, this was
ridiculous—We’re gonna flip a coin! (Phoebe gasps.) All right?! (She flips the
coin.) Heads! (Looks at the coin and grunts in disgust.)"
204,Phoebe, The coins have finally forgiven me!
205,Rachel," Well y’know what? I hope Monica forgives you after you throw her,
her vegetarian, voodoo, goddess circley shower! (Runs out.)"
206,Phoebe," (running after her) Rach, it’s gonna be okay! (To Ross and Joey)
You guys are the best!"
207,Joey," Boy I tell ya, that judging stuff took a lot out of me."
208,Ross, Yeah?
209,Joey," Yeah! I was thinking about maybe going upstairs and taking a little nap on
my couch. (Raises his eyebrows, questioning Ross to see if he wants to join him.) "
210,Ross, Why-why would I care about that?
211,Joey," No reason, I’m just saying that uh… That’s where I’ll
be. "
214,Chandler," As bad as that went I actually enjoyed myself. I think that I’m
going to apologize for all of the stupid things I do."
215,Monica," Why don’t you just stop doing stupid things? Then you wouldn’t
have to apologize."
216,Chandler, I would really love it if could do both.
217,Monica," All right, I…I have to ask."
218,Chandler, What?
219,Monica, Are you gonna break up with me if I get fat again?
220,Chandler, What?!
221,Monica," Well, you broke up with Julie Grath! How much weight could she have
gained?"
222,Chandler, A hundred and forty-five pounds.
223,Monica," In one year?! My God what did she eat? Her-her family! That’s not
the point."
224,Chandler," Look I know it was a stupid reason to break up with somebody, but I
was 15!"
225,Monica," Well… That’s not the only time this was an issue. You remember
when umm, you spent Thanksgiving with us? You called me fat."
226,Chandler," Okay. Okay, now wait a minute that was totally different."
227,Monica, How?
228,Chandler, You were not supposed to hear that! I said that behind you back!
229,Monica," What if I have babies, okay? I mean I’m gonna look different.
I’m okay with that, but I’m not sure that you are!"
230,Chandler," Look you have to realize I don’t think of you as a thin,
beautiful woman. (Monica glares at him.) See this is one of things that I can apologize
for later! Look, what I mean is you’re Monica! Okay? And I am in love with Monica. "
231,Monica, Keep going.
232,Chandler," So you can balloon up or you can shrink down and I will still love
you."
233,Monica, Even if I shrink down to two inches tall?
234,Chandler, I’d carry you around in my pocket.
235,Monica, I love you. (They hug and kiss.)
236,Chandler, Skidmark’s still got a way with the ladies.
238,Rachel, Hi Pheebs.
239,Phoebe, Hi!
240,Rachel, Hi! I just want to apologize. I’m really sorry I was a baby.
241,Phoebe," That’s ridiculous Rachel, we were all babies once. (Rachel looks at
her.) Oh, you mean today."
242,Rachel," Yeah. Yeah, and y’know you-you deserve to win. And-and y’know
I was thinking about it, if-if you’re Monica’s maid of honor that means I get to
be yours."
243,Phoebe, Oh yeah!
244,Rachel," Yeah! Oh, umm when-when Monica and Chandler got engaged I started
putting some stuff together, y’know just in case…"
245,Phoebe, Oh that’s so sweet thanks.
246,Rachel," Here is a book of poetry that I know Monica loves. And-and ohh God this
is funny, look, this is a picture of one Halloween where she dressed up as a bride. (Shows
Phoebe the picture.) And look, she made me carry her train, which was weird because I was Wonder
Woman. Oh and here’s a little purse that I found. (Hands her the purse)
Y’know I just thought that maybe they could hold the rings in there."
247,Phoebe, Ohh.
248,Rachel," And umm, vintage handkerchiefs y’know ‘cause, people cry at
weddings. (Starting to cry.) I’m just gonna grab a couple of these."
249,Phoebe, This stuff is great!
250,Rachel," Oh, I forgot this was in here. Umm, this was the uh garter that I was
saving for my wedding and I wanted it to be Monica’s something borrowed and it’s
blue. (Starts to cry again.) Yeah…"
251,Phoebe," Y’know Rach, I think that, I think you should be Monica’s made
of honor."
252,Rachel, You do? Why?
253,Phoebe, Because I think it means more to you.
254,Rachel," But Pheebs, y’know you earned it."
255,Phoebe," Its fine. I mean, this is something that you’ve been thinking about
since you were what, 14? (She’s referring to the Halloween picture.)"
256,Rachel," No, I was ten. I just developed early."
257,Phoebe, (looking at the picture again) Man alive!
258,Monica," (entering) Hey, what’s going on?"
259,Rachel, Hey!
260,Phoebe," Well, we just decided that Rachel is gonna be your maid of honor."
261,Monica," (gasps) Ohh, wow! That’s great! (Rachel and Monica hug.) Oh wow! We
really have to start planning! I have, I have a lot of really specific ideas! We should
probably get together like four times per week. You can come over to my place; we’ll
get together before work! What do you say, 630, my place? I’m so excited! (Runs out
leaving Rachel completely stunned and Phoebe laughing.)"
262,Rachel," Yeah okay, you laugh now, but she’s gonna be yours. (Phoebe gets
suddenly scared.)"
265,Joey, Great nap.
266,Ross, It really was.
268,Joey," (reacting first by jumping up) Dude! What the hell are you doing?! God!
(Heads for his room leaving Ross.)"
269,Ross, (slowly stands up and says quietly) Excuse me. (Exits.)
0,Joey, Morning!
1,Rachel," Hi! Oh, how was your date last night?"
2,Joey, Pretty good.
3,Rachel," Oh good. (She walks to the closed bathroom door, opens it, and finds a
naked woman wrapped in a towel.) Ahhh! My God, sorry! (She closes the door and confronts
Joey.)"
4,Joey," Okay, really good. Anyway I gotta go; I’m late for work."
5,Rachel, What-what?! You’re gonna leave this person with me?!
6,Joey," Yeah—Hey, don’t worry, she’s a terrific girl. And hey
listen, could you do me a favor? When she comes out could you just mention that I’m
not looking for a serious relationship; that’d be great."
7,Rachel, Why?! What?! Are you kidding?!
8,Joey," Just casually slip it in, y’know lay the groundwork. Tell her uh,
I’m a loner—No! An outlaw! Tell her she doesn’t want to get mixed up with
the likes of me."
9,Rachel," Y’know what? That’s a lot to remember, can’t I just tell
her you’re a pig?"
10,Joey," Hey, I’m gonna call her later! Honest! Oh come on, Chandler used to
do it! He’d even make the girl pancakes! Plus, he’d make extras and leave
‘em for me."
11,Rachel," Well forget it, I’m not telling that girl anything. That is not my
responsibility."
12,Joey," Fine! (Pause) Now, where’d we land on those pancakes? (She chases him
out the door as his date emerges from the bathroom.)"
14,Rachel, Hi.
16,Rachel," Yeah, Joey kinda disabled it when I moved in."
18,Rachel, Hi.
20,Rachel, (pause) Would you like some pancakes?
23,Chandler, …Come on! Why are we here?!
24,Ross," Okay, okay take a guess."
26,Chandler, The hot chicks?
27,Ross," Okay, okay, I was typing names into the library computer earlier,
y’know-y’know for fun, and I typed mine in and guess what came up? My doctoral
dissertation! It’s here! Yeah, it’s right-it’s right down here! In the
biggest library in the university! (They start heading that way, towards a secluded
section behind the racks.)"
28,Chandler, Wow that’s actually pretty cool.
29,Ross," (stopping quickly) Oh umm, there’s also a book here by a woman named
Wendy Bagina. (They both laugh, but stop when the hear moaning coming from the next
aisle.) What is that?"
30,Chandler, Sounds like two people are really enjoying the Dewey decimal system.
34,Chandler," You didn’t bring me here to do that, did you?"
36,Monica, She sent the chicken back again?!
38,Monica, Well fine! I want to meet this chicken expert! Send the Colonel in!
41,Monica," (to the lobster) Lucky bastard! (Throws the lobster in and turns around
to face the planet’s most annoying woman, next to Dr. Laura and Kathy Lee Gifford of
course. She’s the most annoying female TV character however.) Janice."
43,Monica, I’m fine.
45,Monica, Oh… Uh…
48,Chandler," OH…MY…GAWD! I am so sorry sweetie, are you okay? You
didn’t tell her we were getting married, did you?"
49,Monica," Well, she saw the ring."
50,Chandler, Did she freak out?
51,Monica," Well, she was shocked when I told her, but then again so were most
people."
52,Chandler, Right.
53,Monica," Well, she actually has a boyfriend y’know herself, named Clark. Uh,
she also kinda invited herself to our wedding. Clark too."
54,Chandler, (laughs) You said no right?
55,Monica, Huh?
56,Chandler, You said no right?!
57,Monica," Well, she corned me! She asked if the wedding was in town! I mean, what
was I supposed to do?!"
58,Chandler," Lie!!! How hard is that?! The check’s in the mail! Oh your baby
is so cute! I can’t wait to read your book Ross!!"
59,Monica, Come on! So she comes to the wedding! I mean it won’t be so bad.
60,Chandler," What do you think she’s just gonna sit there quietly? You
don’t think she’s gonna want to make a toast? You don’t think she’s
gonna want to grab the microphone and sing Part-time Lover?!"
61,Monica," Oh my God, she’s not gonna like the chicken that night either is
she?!"
62,Chandler," Y’know what? It’s gonna be okay. Y’know what?
She’s probably not gonna even want to come."
63,Monica, Really?
64,Chandler, No! That was a lie! See how easy that was?
65,Monica, So-so you would’ve just lied?
66,Chandler, Yes!!
67,Monica, Would it really have been that easy?
68,Chandler, Yes!!!
69,Monica," Good, so do it Saturday night because we’re going to dinner with
her and Clark."
71,Joey, Hey! What’s up?
73,Joey," Hey-hey, who’s your friend? (Erin turns around to face Joey,
startling him) Hey!!"
75,Joey, Erin! Still here!
76,Rachel," Yeah, we ended up spending the day together and had such a great time!"
77,Joey, Why wouldn’t ya? Erin is great! Then-then there’s you guys.
79,Rachel, I know!
80,Phoebe, Okay!
82,Joey," Yeah. I’ll uh, I’ll call ya."
83,Rachel, Oh and I’ll call ya too!
85,Phoebe, And call me!
86,Joey," (to Erin) Okay, good to see you again."
88,Joey, Bye-bye.
89,Rachel, Bye!
91,Joey," So, system kinda broke down huh?!"
92,Rachel," Oh Joey, I’m sorry I just couldn’t tell her all those things
you wanted me to tell her. And y’know we got to talking and I…"
93,Phoebe, We want you to marry her!
94,Joey, What?!!
95,Phoebe, She is so amazing! You have no idea.
96,Joey, No idea? Who do you think brought her here?
97,Rachel, Cupid.
98,Phoebe," Joey, she’s so cool. She speaks four languages."
99,Joey," Man, do you know what guys want!"
100,Rachel," Look Joey, come on she’s so perfect for you! I mean she’s
sweet, she-she likes baseball, and she-she had two beers at lunch."
101,Joey," My beers?! Look you guys, she’s a very nice girl. Okay? We had a good
time, but I just—I don’t see it going anywhere."
102,Phoebe," Yeah, but you always say that."
103,Rachel," Yeah, maybe if you gave this girl a chance it would go somewhere."
104,Joey," Look I’m sorry you guys, I-I just don’t think so."
105,Phoebe, Whatever.
106,Rachel, Fine. (They start to walk away.)
107,Joey," Hey, don’t start judging me! (To Rachel) Huh? You’re the one
who’s in love with her assistant! (To Phoebe) Huh? And you, you’re the one
having the affair with the guy who keeps the pigeons on the roof!"
108,Rachel, Phoebe!
109,Phoebe, Secret affair!
111,Ross, People are doing it in front of my book!
112,Rachel, I’m sorry?
113,Ross," My doctoral dissertation is in the library at school, I went to see it,
and there were students makin’ babies right in the middle of the Paleontology
section!"
114,Rachel, Oh my God! Did you get to see anything good?
115,Ross," Let me ask you something, at your school was there a like uh a place on
campus where students went to uh, fool around."
116,Rachel," Yeah, there was. It was—there the corner of the library where-where
all these dusty books that nobody ever read—Yes, there was."
117,Ross," Great! Because people kept showing up, I think it’s like uh-a thing!"
118,Joey," Now hold on a second, fifth floor against that back wall?"
119,Ross, Oh for cryin’ out loud! (He storms out.)
120,Joey," All right, so we should go catch our movie."
121,Rachel, Well now what’s the rush?
122,Joey, I like to see the previews. (Rachel looks at him.) The candy.
123,Phoebe, (entering with Erin) Oh. Hey!
124,Rachel, Well look who’s here!
126,Joey, Hey!
128,Joey, Erin.
130,Rachel," Hi! Well, we were just about to take off and see a movie. Oh no!"
132,Rachel," Oh Phoebe, we forgot that party we have to go to."
133,Phoebe, Oh no.
134,Joey, (skeptical) What party?
136,Joey, Who’s birthday party?
138,Joey," (still skeptical) Oh, and how is Allison?"
140,Rachel," (does a retching sound) Wait a minute! Why don’t you guys do
something?!"
141,Joey," (still skeptical) Yeah, look how that worked out."
144,Ross," Excuse me. Hi, I’m a professor here. Do you know the Paleontology
section, fifth floor, stack 437?"
146,Ross," No! No!! No! Can I speak to someone in charge please?! (The librarian
brings his boss over.)"
148,Ross," Hi, I was wondering if it is possible to increase security in the
Paleontology section? See I-I wrote a book up there and instead of reading it people
are-are-are well, rolling around in front of it."
150,Ross," Well, fine. Fine! If-if I’m the only person with any appreciation of
the sanctity of the written word, I’ll go up there and defend it myself! (Starts to
do so, but stops and to the previous librarian) And don’t you follow me!"
152,Joey, Hey.
153,Phoebe, Hey!
154,Rachel, How did it go with Erin?
155,Joey," Oh, unbelievable! We had the best time!"
156,Phoebe," Yay!! Oh so, you’re not, you’re not mad at us anymore?"
157,Joey," No! No! No! You guys were totally right! This is so much better than the
first time we went out. Y’know? That was so awkward, we were really nervous."
158,Phoebe, Didn’t you sleep together?
159,Joey," Yeah that really calms me down. And! We have so much in common! She loves
sandwiches, sports, although she is a Met fan, not much of an issue now but if were ever
to have kids, well that’s a…"
160,Rachel," (gasps) Oh my God! Listen to you talkin’ about having kids. Oh my
Joey. (She goes over and hugs him.) Oh, please don’t get married before I do."
161,Joey, Okay.
164,Monica, He might still show up.
166,Monica, Is that all?
168,Chandler," Well actually uh, there was something we wanted to tell you about the
wedding. Um, it’s going to be a small ceremony. Uh, tiny! We’re not even sure
why we’re having it."
169,Monica, It’s actually going to be just family.
172,Joey, How can you say that?! The Mets have no closer!
174,Joey, What about Game 1 of the Series?
176,Joey," You shut up! (To Phoebe and Rachel) I love arguing with her. (To Erin)
I’ll be right back. "
178,Rachel, So how’s it goin’ with Joey?
180,Rachel," Okay? Wait okay, tell-tell me that you like him, please? I mean tell me
that you like him."
182,Rachel," But you said that you liked him! I mean what happened?! Did ya just
change your mind?!"
184,Phoebe, Then change it back!
186,Phoebe, No spark? Didn’t you sleep together?
188,Rachel," Ugh, tramp!"
189,Phoebe, Does Joey have any idea?
191,Phoebe," Yeah, you mean like that you’re kind of a loner."
193,Phoebe," Yeah, and maybe that you’re a real (She says something in Italian,
and it doesn’t matter what she said. It’s not important so I don’t need
everyone who speaks Italian telling me what she said.)"
195,Phoebe," Oh well, I guess Italian isn’t one of the four languages you speak."
196,Joey, (returning) Hey! You wanna go?
198,Joey, Okay. See you guys later.
200,Rachel," Yeah, see ya."
201,Joey," (whispers to Phoebe and Rachel) Hey, thank you so much. (They both exit.)"
202,Rachel," Wow. Well, I guess it was Cupid who brought her here."
203,Phoebe," No, just a regular old flying dwarf."
205,Ross, Yes? Yes?! How can I help you?
207,Ross," Oh-oh, you’re-you’re fellow scholars. What exactly were you
looking for, hmm? Perhaps, (Grabs a book from the shelf behind him) perhaps Dr. Chester
Stock’s musings on the Smiledon Californicus?"
209,Ross," Ah… Ah…Get out of here! (The couple retreats. Ross starts
looking through the previously mentioned book as a beautiful woman walks into the
section.) Uh, meeting someone? Or-or are you just here to brush up on Marion’s views
on evolution?"
211,Ross, I find Marion’s views far to progressionist.
213,Ross," I’m a professor here uh, Ross…Geller."
215,Ross, Yes! You’re the person who checked out my book?!
217,Ross," Well I uh, I skipped forth grade."
219,Ross, I am very…very sorry.
221,Joey, Hey!
222,Phoebe, Hey!
223,Rachel, Hi!
224,Phoebe," So how was, how was your date?"
225,Joey," Oh, it was great! I mean we walked all around the village. We went to this
ice cream place, split a milkshake, 70/30 but still… And guess what, I’m
thinking about taking her upstate to one of those bed and breakfasts."
226,Phoebe, Oh really? She said she wants to go away with you?
227,Joey," No-no-no-no-no! It’s a surprise, but it’s gonna be tricky
thought because she said she was gonna be pretty busy at work for a while."
229,Rachel," Jo-Joey, look honey we-we need to talk okay? Umm, I kinda got the
feeling from her today that uh, she’s not lookin’ for a serious relationship."
230,Joey, Where are you gettin’ this?
231,Rachel," Well, she told me. She said she’s kinda a loner."
232,Joey, Oh. Oh.
233,Rachel, Joey…
234,Joey," No hey Rach, it’s cool okay? Y’know I’m a loner too! (Heads
for his room.) Right?"
235,Phoebe," Hey Joey, y’know what? You are way to good for her."
236,Rachel," Yeah and honey I promise next time that I will just say good-bye and
tell ‘em you’re not looking for a relationship."
237,Joey," No! No. Don’t do that, just next time make sure she really likes me."
238,Rachel, Well that too. (Joey goes into his room.) Joey?
239,Joey, Yeah?
240,Rachel, Do you want some pancakes?
241,Joey, (coming back out) Finally!
243,Monica, What are we gonna do?
244,Chandler, I say we go with Careless Whisper.
247,Chandler, (To Monica) Did she see us yet? Did she see us?
248,Monica," Janice, what umm, what are you doing here?"
250,Monica, (To Chandler) Our kids are gonna call her Aunt Janice aren’t they?
252,Chandler, Aren’t you just a tinsy bit curious?
254,Monica," Yeah, in-in-in the bathroom."
256,Monica, We’ll just…we’ll just let her stay.
257,Chandler," No-no-no-no, if we let her stay, she will stay forever!"
258,Monica, Kinda like your Barca lounger.
259,Chandler, Is that what you’re thinking about right now?
260,Monica, I never stop thinking about it.
262,Chandler," Janice, I’m sorry but umm, you can’t stay here tonight."
264,Chandler," Honestly? Our apartment is a hotbed for electromagnetic activity. Now
Monica and I have been immunized, but sadly you have not."
268,Monica, Oh my God! Oh my God! You have to go!
270,Monica, Because Chandler still has feelings for you!
272,Chandler, Say again?
273,Monica," That’s right. That’s right. And that is why you can’t
stay here tonight. And probably why you shouldn’t come to the wedding."
274,Chandler," Feelings, such strong feelings."
275,Monica," I mean, I realize that his feelings may never completely go away, but you
can."
279,Ross," (to the guard) Don’t sweat it, I’ve got this section covered.
Yeah, in fact I’ve got this little baby (Turns on a mini-flashlight) to shine in
people’s eye—(The guard walks away)—Okay, see you later. "
281,Chandler, I just wanted to show Monica your book. (Ross just glares at him.)
0,Ross, (entering) Hey everybody! Happy Thanksgiving! 
1,Chandler," No, no, no. No-no-no. "
3,Ross," What, are we keeping Thanksgiving a secret this year? "
4,Chandler," No, we're playing this game I learned at work. You have to name all
the states in six minutes. "
5,Ross, What? That's like insanely easy! 
6,Chandler," Now, that's a lot harder than it sounds. You always forget at least
one, or in some cases... fourteen (looks over to Monica). "
7,Monica," It's a stupid game and I wasn't playing against other people, so
technically I didn't lose. "
8,Ross, What? You forgot fourteen states? 
9,Monica," Nobody cares about the Dakotas. (That’s true in so many ways, trust
me, I’ve lived in one and been to the other.)"
11,Chandler," Oh, okay, time's up! "
12,Rachel," All right, I got 48. "
13,Chandler," Oh that's not bad, Pheebs? "
14,Phoebe," Oh, I got tired of naming states. So I decided to list the types of
celery, and I have one regular celery. "
15,Chandler," Okay, so Rachel's got 48 and Phoebe has the lead in…vegetables,
Joey? "
16,Joey, Say hello to the new champ of Chandler's dumb states game. 
17,Ross," Wow, how many have you got? "
18,Joey, Fifty-six! 
21,Joey, Hey! How is New England not a state? Huh? They have a sports-team! 
22,Chandler," Does South Oregon have a sports-team? (Joey strikes one from his list)
There you go. "
24,Rachel, (counting the place settings) How come we have one extra place setting? 
25,Monica, 'Cause you invited your assistant. 
26,Rachel," Oh, right. Sorry. But Tag's not coming; his girlfriend came into town,
so he's spending Thanksgiving with her. "
27,Monica," Oh! Why didn't you tell me? I made him his own individual sweet potato
stuffed pumpkin. "
28,Rachel," Well, I was going to, but then I figured, you know... you're food is so
delicious and perfect, you can never have too many of those pumpkin things. "
29,Monica," Now you think I wouldn't enjoy that, because it is so fake, (Laughs) but
I still do."
30,Phoebe," Regular Celery! (Starts to write that on her list) Oh, I already have
that. (She gets up and heads for her room) "
31,Ross, Done! With time a-to-spare. 
32,Chandler," Oooh that may be a New World's record (Looks at his watch and picks up
Ross' pad) "
33,Ross," You know, I hate to lecture you guys, but it's kinda disgraceful, that a
group of well-educated adults and Joey can't name all the states. Did you ever see a map,
or one of those round, colorful things called ""a globe?"" Hmm? "
34,Chandler," Uh, Magellan? You got 46 states. (Smiles and hands Ross back his pad) "
35,Ross, What? That's impossible. 
36,Joey," 46. Wow! Who's well educated now, Mr. I-forgot-ten-states? "
37,Monica," All right, I'm out of oven space. I'm gonna turn on Joey's. Please,
watch him! Do not let Joey eat any of the food! "
38,Chandler," I am only one man! (Monica heads out) Okay Ross, time is up! "
39,Ross," No, just give me another minute. "
40,Chandler," Look Ross, if you don't know them by now, you will never know them,
okay? That is the beauty of this game. It makes you want to kill yourself. "
41,Ross," This-this is crazy! I can do this! All right, uhh, I bet I can get all 50
before dinner. "
42,Chandler," Okay, but if you can't…no dinner! "
43,Ross, You're on! 
44,Joey," (gets up) All right. Don't look at my list, Ross, 'cause there's a lot on
there that you don't have. "
45,Monica," (entering, to Joey and Rachel) Hey, did you guys know, that your oven
doesn't work? "
46,Joey," But the drawer full of take-out menus is okay, right? "
47,Monica," Ross, I'm gonna use yours, okay? "
48,Ross, Pshhshhh!
49,Monica, Chandler? Can you give me a hand? (Grabs her jacket) 
50,Chandler," Sure, and Joey; do not let Ross look at any of the maps or the globe
in your apartment. "
51,Joey," Don't worry, Chandler, it's not a globe of the United States. "
53,Phoebe, Hey you guys I'm gonna go out and take a walk. 
54,Ross," Phoebe, why is your bag moving? "
55,Phoebe," Oh, it's not! "
56,Rachel," Seriously, it's moving! "
57,Joey, What the hell is in there? 
58,Phoebe," It's just my knitting that's all! (A dog sticks its head out of Phoebe's
bag. Everyone looks puzzled.) Yes! I knit this. I'm very good. "
60,Monica," Ross’s apartment is nice! How come we don't hang out here more
often? "
61,Chandler," I don't know. Maybe it's because it smells a little weird. It's like
old pumpkins or something. "
62,Monica, That's my pie! 
63,Chandler, Which smells delicious! 
64,Monica, Uh-oh! Uh-oh! 
65,Chandler, What? 
66,Monica," We left Joey alone with the food! (Walks towards the window and looks
out) Yep! Yep, I knew it! There he is... feeding stuffing to a dog! "
68,Phoebe, (answering the phone) Hi Geller-Bing residence. How can I help?
69,Monica," Phoebe, why is there a dog in our apartment? "
70,Phoebe," I'm sorry, who's this? "
71,Monica," Phoebe, there's a dog sitting on my couch! "
72,Chandler," Tell her, I'm allergic, and I will sue! "
73,Phoebe," No, there's no dog here? "
74,Monica," Yes there is! He's black and white and shaggy and [Cut to Monica’s
apartment] he's sitting next to Rachel and licking Rachel's hand. "
75,Phoebe, Oh my god! Where are you? (Looks around.)
76,Monica, I'll be right there! 
77,Phoebe," (Phoebe hangs up and someone knocks on the door. She gasps.) They're
here already? How are they doing this? "
78,Rachel, (gets up and opens the door) Hi Tag! What are you doing here? 
80,Rachel," Well, sure! Come in! (He enters) Well, what-what happened to your
girlfriend? "
82,Rachel," Oh, I'm sorry. "
84,Ross, Ohio!! Thank you! 
86,Chandler, Huh! Where is the dog?!
87,Ross, What dog? There-there's no dog here. 
88,Joey, Yeah that dog left! 
89,Monica," (walks to Phoebe's door) Phoebe! Phoebe, open up! "
90,Phoebe, There's no dog in here. 
92,Chandler," Phoebe, we can hear the dog barking! "
93,Phoebe," No that's just me coughing! (Doing some weird coughing noises and the
dog barks again. Phoebe comes out of the room.) Oh, good, there you are! Listen, um, I
have a dog in my room. "
94,Chandler, What is it doing here? 
95,Phoebe," Well, I'm watching it for some friends who went out of town. Wait. (She
bends down, picks up the dog, and waves with one of its paws) Hello, my name is Clunkers.
May I please stay with you nice people?"
96,Monica," Oooh, I wish she could stay here, but Chandler is allergic! "
97,Chandler," Extremely allergic, okay? If I'm anywhere near a dog for more than 5
minutes, my throat will just close up! "
98,Phoebe," That's odd, 'cause this dog's been living here for the past 3 days "
99,Chandler, (gasping) Really? 
100,Monica," Chandler, if that dog's been here that long, and you haven't had a
reaction, maybe you're not allergic to this dog? "
101,Chandler," Well, it still has to go, right?"
103,Chandler," Okay, it's um…"
104,Joey, (interrupting him) Don't do it! 
105,Monica, Don't do what? 
106,Chandler," (to Joey) I have to! Okay? It's time! (Joey shrugs as if to say,
""Do what you have to do"") Okay, I hate dogs. "
108,Phoebe, Are you crazy? 
109,Ross, Are you out of your mind?
110,Phoebe, Why? 
111,Joey, Told ya. (Waves bye-bye.)
112,Chandler," They are needy, they are jumpy, and you can't tell what they are
thinking, and that scares me a little bit. "
113,Ross," Right, they are scary. (He jumps up, screaming) Ahh, she just ate a treat
out of my hand!!!"
114,Rachel," Wait a minute. Do you not like all dogs? I mean, not even puppies? "
115,Chandler, (scared) Is there a puppy here? 
117,Chandler," (to Tag) Okay, you are new!"
118,Joey," Look, Chandler, I told you, never tell anyone about this dog thing. It's
like Ross not likin’ ice cream. "
119,Phoebe, You don't like ice cream? 
120,Ross, It's too cold. 
121,Chandler," Okay, it's just that dogs make me a little uncomfortable. "
122,Ross, (to Phoebe) It hurts my teeth.
123,Chandler," And I don't wanna say this, I don't you guys to hate me, but uh, I
don't think, I can be around that dog anymore. Okay, so either the dog goes, or I go. (An
awkward silence ensues.) Oh my god!!"
125,Ross," How can I not get this? I'm a college professor; I got 1450 on my S.A.T.s.
"
126,Monica, 1250.
127,Ross," Damn, I forgot you were here. "
128,Phoebe," All right. We're gonna take Clunkers to Ross’s. We'll be back in a
minute. (Gets up with Monica to do so.)"
129,Rachel," Oh, wait before you guys go, can I just ask you a question? "
130,Monica, Yeah. 
131,Rachel," When a guy breaks up with his girlfriend, what is an appropriate amount
of time to wait before you make a move? "
132,Phoebe," Oh, I'd say about a month. "
133,Monica, Really? I'd say 3 to 4. 
134,Joey, Half hour. (Rachel turns to look at him and he nods yes.)
135,Rachel, Interesting. 
136,Monica," When it's your assistant, I would say never. "
137,Joey," All right, Rach, the big question is, does he like you? All right? Because
if he doesn't like you, this is all a moo-point. "
138,Rachel, Huh. A moo-point? 
139,Joey," Yeah, it's like a cow's opinion. It just doesn't matter. It's moo. "
140,Rachel," (to Monica and Phoebe) Have I been living with him for too long, or did
that all just make sense?"
141,Monica," Please, don't listen to Joey, okay. Would you look at him? He-he’s
obviously depressed. He's away from his family; he's spending Thanksgiving with strangers.
  What he needs right now is for you to be his friend. "
142,Rachel," You're right, I'm sorry. Thank you. Okay, that's what I'm gonna do. "
143,Joey," Fine! Take their advice. No one ever listens to me. When the package is
this pretty, no one cares what's inside. "
145,Rachel, Hey! 
147,Rachel, How are you holding up? 
149,Rachel, Yeah? I'm sorry about your girlfriend. 
151,Rachel, So were you guys together a long time? 
153,Rachel, Now that she broke up with you? 
155,Rachel, Yeah. Hmmmm. 
157,Rachel," No…Yeah, all the time, constantly. It's terrifying. But you know
that I figure it…it has to work out. "
159,Rachel," Because, uh—it has to. "
161,Rachel," Yeah, I know, I do. I really do. "
163,Rachel," Well, what is a boss for? Hug it out! (They hug) "
164,Joey," (through the window) All right, he likes you back! Huh? Told ya, you
should go for it! "
166,Joey," (realizes what he said) Street noise drowned any of that out? (Rachel
moves madly towards him) No, all right, I see you later, okay... (Turns away embarrassed) "
170,Rachel," Uh, yeah, well, see, he… Joey knows, that I'm-I'm very insecure
about my back and, and…you're hugging me, so obviously you are not repulsed by it,
yeah!"
172,Rachel," No? (He shakes his head) All right, here's the truth um, Joey said what
he said, because um, I'm attracted to you. "
174,Rachel," Yeah, I admit it. I have a crush on you, and uh, and, and I know that's
crazy because we work together, and-and nothing could ever happen, and the last thing I
want to do is-is to freak you out or make you feel uncomfortable. Which is why it would be
really great if you said something right about now. "
176,Rachel, What? 
178,Rachel," Okay, that's gonna take them a minute. Do you have anything else you
wanna get off your chest? "
180,Rachel," (she hurries after him) Wait, we still have time to talk and
they’re-they're not even in the car yet! (She takes a quick look down the street.) Oh
look, there they go, okay. (She hurries in, too) "
182,Monica," Okay Phoebe, we should probably go back now. "
183,Phoebe," (doing Clunkers) Please don't leave me, I'll be lonely. "
184,Monica, Stop it. Stop! Okay let's go. We can be strong.
185,Phoebe," Yeah, okay. "
187,Monica," Oh my god! Did you hear that? She said Monica! (She goes back to
Clunkers again) Oooh, I can't leave her! "
188,Phoebe," You know if you want, we can sneak the dog back in and Chandler wouldn't
even know. "
189,Monica, That's not gonna work. 
190,Phoebe," I've had that dog there for three days and Chandler had no idea. He's
not so smart. "
191,Monica, Hey! I didn't know either. 
192,Phoebe," Yeah, but you kinda knew that something was going on, didn't you? "
193,Monica," Yeah, I knew. "
195,Phoebe, Where's Chandler? 
196,Chandler, (comes out of the bathroom) Here I am. 
197,Phoebe, Wash your hands!!!
198,Chandler, How did you…know? (Heads back into the bathroom) 
200,Ross, Hey! What's she doing back here? 
201,Monica," Relax, Ross. She's not made of ice cream! "
202,Ross," Hey look, Phoebe. I, uh, I laid out the states geographically... "
203,Phoebe," (interrupts him) No, no, we don't really have time for this right now.
Okay, we have to keep Chandler away from my bedroom. "
204,Ross," Yeah, but, but look what I'm... "
205,Phoebe," See, this is exactly what we do not have time for. (She rushes into her
room) "
206,Chandler, (comes out of the bathroom) Where's Monica? 
207,Ross," Um, in Phoebe's room. You can't go in there. "
208,Chandler, Why not? 
210,Ross, Monica's crying. She's very upset about this whole Clunkers thing. 
211,Chandler," Well, I, I should go in there. "
212,Ross," No. No, no. She doesn't want to see you right now. "
213,Chandler, Why not? 
214,Ross, Because you sent away the dog!
215,Chandler, This is ridiculous. (He heads for Phoebe's bedroom) 
216,Ross," Oh, is it? Is it? Look, when Monica and I were kids, we had a dog
named Rover. And, uh, one day, my dad decides, he doesn't like dogs. So Monica and her
friend…Phyllis…take away the dog. And that was the last time we ever saw him.
Don't you see? This is just like that. Only with a few details changed. "
217,Joey," (entering) Okay, I'm in my sweat pants. Bring on the food! (Sees that
Chandler has a worried look on his face) What's the matter? "
218,Chandler," Monica's all upset, because I sent Clunkers away. "
219,Joey," So? Bring the dog back, you're a hero. "
220,Chandler," Yeah, I can be a hero, I could do that. I could, I could do... I,
w-w-what if, what if it attacks me? "
221,Joey," Chandler, it's like a big gerbil."
222,Chandler, And that doesn't scare you? (He walks out) 
223,Joey," Ross, you need some help? "
224,Ross," From you? (He does a weird desperate laughter, like he's almost crying)
Yes, please! "
225,Joey," (sits down next to Ross) First of all, Utah? Dude, you can't just make
stuff up!"
227,Ross," I hate America! When I finish this game, I swear I am moving. "
229,Joey, Hey! Tag's still talking to the police. 
230,Rachel," Yeah, ohh! Why, damnit, why did I open my mouth? (In a girlish voice) I
have a crush on you; I am attracted to you. (Back to normal again) Gee, I-I know that I
freaked him out "
231,Joey," If you said it like that, you probably did, yeah. "
233,Phoebe," (opens her bedroom door and peeks out) Hey, is Chandler here? "
234,Chandler," No, no he went for a walk. "
235,Phoebe," Okay, but you cannot tell him... but look whose back! "
237,Rachel, (gasps) Hi! 
238,Joey," Oh No-no-no-no-no-no-no! He went over to Ross' to bring the dog back here!
"
239,Phoebe," Oh no, the dog's not going to be there! "
240,Joey, You think? 
242,Monica," Hi, honey. "
243,Chandler," Please, please, please, don't be mad at me. "
244,Monica," What? Why, why would... "
245,Phoebe," (interrupts her, to Monica) Shh, wait and see. Maybe we will, maybe we
won't. "
246,Chandler," Okay, I went over to Ross' apartment to bring back Clunkers.
Y’know, for you, and…(Clears his throat) I left the door open and she must have
gotten out and I looked everywhere, all over the apartment, including the roof,
which FYI Ross, one of your neighbors, growing weed. I couldn't find him, and I am so, so,
so, sorry. But I do know where we could all go ease the pain. (Points up and then
over to the street) "
247,Phoebe," We have good news, look whose back! "
248,Rachel, (uncovers the dog) Hi! 
249,Chandler, Clunkers?! Oh my god! 
250,Monica," That's right, she came back all by herself. "
251,Phoebe, It's a Thanksgiving miracle! 
252,Chandler, (to Clunkers) It is so good to see you! 
253,Phoebe," Yeah, she came all the way back from Ross' building. Oh, the things she
must have seen! And then she climbed up the fire escape and she tapped on the window with
her teeny little paw and then we ran to let her in…(Realizes, that Chandler starts to
not believing her) I went to far, didn't I? When should I have stopped? "
255,Ross," Okay, maybe this is so hard, because there aren't 50 states. Let me tell
you something, I have 49 states, and there are no more! I-I think, I should be able
to eat something. "
256,Chandler, It's up to you. 
258,Rachel," Oh, hi! How are you doing? "
260,Rachel, Oh. 
262,Ross," Tag? Y-You're going? (Comes over to Tag) Uh we didn't, uh we didn't get
the chance to talk. Uh, so, where did you say you're from again? "
264,Ross," Ah, what good are you. (Walks back to his map dejectedly.) "
266,Rachel," Look, um, I think we should talk about what happened on the terrace. "
268,Rachel," Ah, I-I never should have said what I said. It—y’know what? It
just doesn't matter how I feel. I mean we work together, so nothing could really ever
happen between us, and what I would love is just to go to work on Monday, and-and never
talk about this again, okay? Big day Monday lots to do. So, we're okay? "
270,Rachel," Oh, god, I know it, that I freaked you out. "
272,Rachel, Really? 
274,Rachel," Okay, well, that's one less thing we have to do on Monday. "
277,Ross, Delaware! (Starting to cry.) Delaware!
278,Chandler, All right. 
279,Ross, (hands Chandler his pad and walks in) I want my turkey now! 
280,Chandler," You got it. (Starts looking at the pad, while Ross got the turkey out
of the fridge and starts to unwrap and it) You got Nevada twice. "
281,Ross, (pauses) I know. 
282,Chandler, Yeah. (Throws the pad on the table and heads for the bedroom)
1,Ross, You sure?
3,Chandler," Okay, let me just straighten out your helmet there. (Does so.)"
5,Ross," No-no, one daddy, two mommies. All right, it’s all yours.
(Ross pushes him off.)"
6,Chandler, Okay. Okay.
7,Ross, Yes! Yes! Yes!! (Everyone stands and claps.)
8,Phoebe," His first big kid’s bike, this is so exciting!"
9,Monica," Oh yeah, I remember mine! Ohh, it was my sixth birthday, my dad took me
to the park, I got it, and…it bent."
10,Ross, Yeah.
11,Phoebe, I never had a bike of my own.
12,Ross, (shocked) What?!
13,Phoebe," Well, we didn’t have a lot of money. But the girl across the street
had the best bike! It was pink and it had rainbow colored tassels hanging off the
handle grips, and-and-and a bell and this big, white wicker basket with those
plastic daisies stuck on."
14,Chandler," That sounds like my first bike. (They all turn and look at him.) My
dad gave me his old one."
15,Ross, Ohh.
16,Monica, Did the girl ever let you ride it?
17,Phoebe," No! But she gave me the box that it came in. It had a picture of the
bike on the front. (They’re all speechless) So I would sit on it and my step-dad
would drag me around the backyard."
18,Ross, That is so unfair!
19,Phoebe," Not really, I got to drag him around too! (They all nod,
""Oh."")"
22,Chandler, Hey! What are you guys doing? 
23,Joey, Hey.
24,Monica, Making holiday candy for the neighbors.
25,Chandler," I’m sorry, who?"
26,Monica," I’m gonna hang this basket (Points to the one sitting on the table)
on the door and when the neighbors walk by they can all take a piece."
27,Chandler, But we don’t know the neighbors.
28,Joey," I do. There’s uh, let’s see, Guy With a Mustache, Smokes-A-Lot
Lady, Some Kids I’ve Seen, and A Red-haired Guy Who Does Not Like To Be Called Rusty."
29,Monica," See? This is exactly why I’m making this candy. We can learn
their names and get to know our neighbors."
30,Chandler, Wouldn’t it be easier if we just moved?
31,Rachel," (entering, happily) Gooood morning!!"
32,Chandler," Eh, somebody’s in a good mood!"
33,Rachel," Well, why shouldn’t I be? I have great friends! I have a wonderful
job!"
34,Monica, Where you can make out with your assistant.
35,Rachel," Come on, it’s not a big deal! We stayed up all night coming up with
a plan so that us dating will not be a problem."
36,Monica," Oh yeah, what’s the plan?"
37,Rachel," (pauses as she thinks and exhales loudly) We… We are not…
…going to let it… be a problem."
38,Monica, Wow! It took you all night to come up with that plan?!
39,Rachel," Well y’know, we did other stuff too. (Joey and Chandler start to
giggle.)"
40,Monica, Did you two…
41,Rachel," Oh Monica come on, y’know I don’t sleep with guys on the first
date!"
42,Monica," Matt Guire, Mark Lynn, Ben Wire…"
43,Rachel, Anymore!!
44,Monica, Okay.
46,Rachel," Hi. Tag, I have a conference call today is that correct?"
48,Rachel," Okay, thank you. That’ll be all. (The mail guy leaves and Tag
starts to follow, but Rachel stops him.) (Excitedly) Wait! Wait! (Rushes over and closes
the office-door.) Did you see that? That mail guy had no idea there was something going on
between us. (They kiss.)"
50,Rachel," Okay, you hard worker! I’ll remember to put that in your
evaluation."
52,Rachel," Well, you’ve been here for two months now and your boss is required
to hand in a performance evaluation. But y’know, there is one thing that I have yet
to evaluate. (She turns around and sweeps the stuff off of her desk and hops up onto it.) "
54,Rachel," No, I’ve just always wanted to do that. Can you help me clean this
up?"
56,Monica," The basket is totally empty! My God, the neighbors ate all the candy!"
57,Chandler," Well, either that or uh…(Motions towards Joey’s door.)"
58,Monica, Joey!! 
60,Joey, Yeah?
61,Monica, Did you eat all the neighbor candy?!
62,Joey," Uh well yeah, that was the plan, but by the time I got to it there was
only a couple of pieces left!"
63,Phoebe," Yeah, and they’ve been coming by all day. They love it!"
64,Monica," They love my candy? Oh man!!! I’ve gotta go make more!! (Starts to
do so.)"
65,Joey," Hey Mon, you might wanna make some more lasagna too, because something
might’ve happened to a huge chunk of it."
67,Monica, Ross! The neighbors ate all my candy!!
68,Ross," Mine stole my newspaper! It’s like a crime wave!! (Monica runs
to make more candy.) Pheebs, you uh, you got a second."
69,Phoebe, Sure!
70,Ross," Yeah, ever since you uh, told me that story about that bike I-I
couldn’t stop thinking about it. I mean, everyone should have a-a first bike,
so… "
72,Phoebe, (gasps) Oh my God Ross!!
73,Ross, You like it?
74,Phoebe, I love it!!
75,Ross, Yeah?
76,Phoebe, Ohh!! Ohh!! And I love you!
77,Ross, Ahh.
78,Phoebe, Not that way! But the bike brought you a lot closer!
79,Ross," Ah! (She hugs him.) Well uh-uh, t-take it downstairs, y’know give it
a test ride."
80,Phoebe," Okay! Oh my God! My first bike! Thank you for the best present I’ve
ever gotten."
81,Ross, (stunned at the complement) You’re welcome.
82,Phoebe," (starts to leave, but stops) Oh and Chandler’s about to cry."
83,Chandler, (about to cry) Am not!
85,Monica, (turning a light on) Who is that?!
86,Chandler," Don’t worry, I’m brave! I am brave! I…I am brave! (They
get to the door and Monica goes to open it.) No-no-no-no!! (He stops her.) (Through the
door.) Can you tell me who is there please?"
90,Monica, Hi. Do you know what time it is?
92,Monica, Oh please! (To Chandler) Did you hear that? Little drops of heaven.
93,Chandler, (laughs) 400 A.M.
95,Chandler," I am sorry, but some of us have to get up early and go to work!
(Monica looks at him) (To Monica) He does not know that I am not some of us."
96,Monica," Umm, listen I am sorry, but I’ll put some out first thing in the
morning."
98,Monica, Um-hmm.
100,Chandler, Mm! Night Gar’! (Monica closes the door.)
102,Rachel, (hugging him) So did you read your evaluation yet?
104,Rachel," (worried) Okay please, you’re kidding right?! I wrote that one as a
joke for you!"
106,Rachel, I’m thinkin’ no.
108,Rachel," Umm, I said I thought you were a good kisser, and uh, and that I like
your tiney-tiny touchie."
110,Rachel," Well, it gets worse. When asked if you take initiative I wrote,
""Yes, he was able to unhook my bra with minimal supervision,"" and under Problems
with Performance I wrote, ""Dear God, I hope not,"" and then uh, then I drew a
little smiley face, and then a small pornographic sketch."
112,Monica," Ross! That is so sweet of you to get Phoebe that bike! When I heard the
story, I almost cried."
113,Joey, Almost cried huh? Hear that Chandler? Almost cried!
114,Chandler," Hey, you cry every time somebody talks about Titanic!"
115,Joey, (about to cry) Those two only had each other!
116,Ross, Phoebe really likes the bike huh?
117,Monica," Oh yeah! I saw her walkin’ it down the street the other day. She
had uh, these flowers in the basket. It was so cute."
118,Joey," Yeah, I saw her this morning walkin’ it by the park."
119,Ross," Wait a minute, she was walking the bike? Both times?"
121,Joey, Hey Pheebs?
122,Phoebe, Oh hi!
123,Chandler, Hey! So are you enjoying the bike?
124,Phoebe," Ohh, uh-huh so much!"
125,Ross, Pheebs you uh…you do know how to ride a bike don’t you?
126,Phoebe, Of course!
127,Monica," Umm, can we see you ride it?"
128,Phoebe," Okay. (The gang is giggles then Phoebe gets the bike out of the rack,
gets on, pushes off, rolls a few feet, and falls over.) See?"
131,Monica," See, this is why I told you never get involved with your assistant! And
here is no such thing as keeping secrets when it comes to affairs. (To Chandler) Did you
hear that Chandler? No such thing!"
132,Chandler, (with his mouth full) What happened? I’m just eating candy.
133,Rachel," Maybe it’s not as bad as I think. Y’know, maybe they
didn’t take it the way I meant it."
134,Chandler," Absolutely! Y’know, because touchie can mean both ass and good
worker."
135,Rachel," Ugh, I just gotta get the thing back!"
136,Joey, Hey Rach?
137,Rachel, Yeah?
138,Joey," That sketch you mentioned? Might it have looked a little something like
this? (He shows her what he’s been drawing.)"
139,Rachel, Oh my God! Joey!
140,Chandler, What is the matter with you?
141,Rachel, Ugh!
142,Joey," Boy I tell ya, this little talent came in handy before I could afford
porn."
145,Monica," I’m sorry, I can’t help you. See? (Points to her new sign.)
Rules are rules."
147,Monica," No kidding, out of towners huh? What did you tell ‘em?"
149,Monica," Some people have been saying its y’know little drops of heaven, but
whatever."
151,Joey," (watching the discussion) Hey Chandler, do we know that lady?"
152,Chandler," Maybe, isn’t she the woman who lives below you and has sex really
loud?"
153,Monica," (still talking to the woman) All right, I’ll do it just this once!
But you can’t tell anybody!"
157,Monica," (closing the door) It’s unbelievable! I-I can’t believe that
sign didn’t work!"
158,Chandler, Y’know what would work?
159,Monica, Hmm?
160,Chandler, Stop making candy!
161,Monica, But they like it!
162,Chandler, You mean they like you.
163,Monica, Maybe.
164,Chandler, Is that why you became a chef? So that people would like you?
165,Monica," Oh, you really want to talk about getting people to like you huh, funny
man? (Joey laughs but stops when Chandler turns to glare at him.)"
167,Ross," Okay, now just remember everything I taught you and you’ll be fine.
Okay? Here we go. Ready…Set…"
168,Phoebe," (hopping off the bike) Wait! This seat is really uncomfortable! Yeah,
maybe before we start we should just get another one. Perhaps, like an airplane
seat—or a beanbag chair!"
169,Ross," Phoebe, you can’t get out of this! Okay? You have to learn how
to ride a bike!"
170,Phoebe, Why? Why do I have to learn?
171,Ross, Well…In-in case of emergency.
172,Phoebe, What kind of an emergency?
173,Ross," Well let there—what if a man comes along and puts a gun to your head
and says, ""You ride this bike or I’ll sh…I’ll shoot you."""
174,Phoebe," Okay, I would ring the bell to distract him and then I would knock the
gun out of his hand with a Chinese throwing star."
175,Ross," Okay, Phoebe just-just get-get on the bike and—Hey! I’ll hold
you up and-and push you. Okay?"
176,Phoebe, You won’t let go?
177,Ross, No!
178,Phoebe, Swear?!
179,Ross, I swear!
180,Phoebe, (thinks it over) Okay. 
181,Ross," Come on. (She gets on the bike.) All right, here we go. All right? (They
start.) "
182,Phoebe, All right.
183,Ross, All right. Feel good?
184,Phoebe, Well…
185,Ross," All right, try pedaling. "
186,Phoebe, Okay. (Does so.)
187,Ross," That’s it, your doing great."
188,Phoebe, Okay.
189,Ross, Doing great! Yes-yes-yes! Take control! Yes!
190,Phoebe, Weee!!! (Ross pushes her and lets go.)
191,Ross," Yes!! Yes!!! (He starts clapping and Phoebe turns around to look at him
and falls off the bike.)"
192,Phoebe, Oh! Oh! Oh no!! You swore!
193,Ross, I-I just thought you were doing so well. I…
194,Phoebe," I am shocked! Shocked!! (She storms off leaving Ross to defend himself
from the angry looks from onlookers.)"
195,Ross," It’s a legitimate learning technique. (Looking around and seeing the
woman behind him glaring at him.) Wow!"
197,Ross," Hey, there’s uh, some people outside, askin’ about candy."
198,Monica," Well, they’re just gonna have to wait aren’t they? I’ve
only got two hands!!"
199,Ross, Need some help?
200,Monica," No! You don’t know the system! There’ll be nobody messing with
the system!"
201,Ross," By the way, the week before your wedding you may not see a lot of me. (She
glares at him and he quickly makes his way to Phoebe’s room.)"
203,Phoebe," (seeing him) Oh, hello liar."
204,Ross," (entering) Look, I-I’m really sorry I let go of the bike."
205,Phoebe, I could’ve been killed I hope you know!
206,Ross," I know. I know. But, can we please try it again? Huh? I mean, you were so
close Phoebe!"
207,Phoebe," Well, I would love to but…the bike got stolen and the police have
no suspects. (Ross just happens to have his hand on a sheet that is covering something
that suspiciously looks like a bike.) "
208,Ross, Phoebe.
209,Phoebe, What?! (Ross rings the bell.) What the hell?!
210,Ross," All right, y’know what? If you are not going to learn how to ride
this bike then I’m sorry, I’m just gonna have to take it back."
211,Phoebe, What?! Why?!
212,Ross," Because! Because, it-it-it’s… It’d be like you having this
guitar (Points to hers) and-and never playing it. Okay, this guitar wants to be
played! And-and this bike wants to be ridden and-and if you don’t ride it
you-you’re-you’re killing its spirit! (Pause) The bike is dying."
213,Phoebe," All right. If you care enough to make up that load of crap, okay."
214,Ross," Great! Great! (He runs to the door.) You’re making the bike very
happy."
215,Phoebe," (sarcastically) Okay Ross! (Ross exits and she says quietly to the bike)
Please don’t die!"
217,Rachel," Okay, I think we can get the evaluation back before they see it, but
we’re gonna have to get into Mr. Zelner’s office. Now, he doesn’t get in
until 10, so he’s no problem, but his assistant, Betty, she comes in early to eat her
breakfast at her desk."
219,Rachel," Yeah, well Betty’s kinda sad. Which is why I believe I can lure her
away with these chocolates. (Holding up the box of chocolates.) Now, while I distract her,
you get in the office."
221,Rachel, Let’s roll!
224,Rachel," (worried and shocked) Yeah, sure Mr. Zelner, for you
anything—minute. Okay. Fine. (To Tag) Abort the plan, abort the plan. (She start to
usher Tag out.)"
226,Rachel," Okay. Uh, well can we, can we get you anything Mr. Zelner? Maybe some
chocolates? (Holds up the box.)"
228,Rachel," (laughs) Oh my God. Can you imagine if there was?! I mean, (getting
serious) what would happen exactly."
230,Rachel, Well…
232,Rachel, Oh no-no-no…
237,Rachel," You’re lookin’ at it upside down—y’know what? (Grabs
the evaluation and throws it out.) It doesn’t matter."
239,Rachel, Whoa! I can’t believe you did that. That was really sweet.
241,Rachel," No, you could’ve lost your job."
243,Rachel, Thank you! You’re great! (They kiss.)
245,Rachel, What?
247,Rachel, I… It just—it took me so long to get that desk organized.
249,Rachel, (looking at his butt) There it is. (They hug.)
251,Chandler, (asking a man leaning against the wall) What is going on? 
253,Joey, Yeah lady! Give us candy!!
254,Chandler, Joey!
255,Joey, What’s up buddy?
256,Chandler, What are you doing?
257,Joey, Waiting for candy.
258,Chandler," Get in here! (They head for the door and Chandler sees Smokes-A-Lot
Lady standing next to the door and smoking, to her) Hey, and you can not smoke in here!
(Takes the cigarette and takes a drag for himself.) (Exhaling in ecstasy) Merry Christmas."
259,Monica," (opening the door and frantically) Okay, guys! The candy is coming; I
just need another 15 minutes for the chocolate to cool!"
261,Chandler," All right everybody! Just be quiet! Be quiet! Be quiet!!
Pipe-pipe-pipe down! (They settle down) What is the matter with you people?! This woman
was trying to do a nice thing for you. She was making candy so she could try to get to
know all of you, and I’ll bet that not one of you can tell me her name! Am I right?"
263,Chandler, No not (imitating) Candy Lady.
264,Joey," (stepping in and knocking the man over) Hey, if we know it can we have
candy?!!"
265,Chandler," All right, y’know what? Forget it, all of you forget it!
You’ve ruined it! Go home! You’ve ruined it! You’ve ruined it!"
266,Joey," That’s right, it’s all ruined! You guys ruined everything! You
ruined it! (Steps into the apartment and Chandler closes the door.) (Joey struts over to
the candy and starts eating it.)"
267,Monica, (To Chandler) Thank you.
268,Chandler, You’re welcome. (They kiss.)
269,Monica, Did you smoke?
270,Chandler," No! Smokes-A-Lot Lady blew smoke directly into my mouth.
Eh-uh—are you okay?"
271,Monica," I’m fine now, but it was really scary there for a while. I mean,
someone slipped a-a threatening note under the door."
272,Joey," (with his mouth full) Oh yeah, sorry about that. Mob mentality or
whatever, I don’t know… (Grabs the note.)"
275,Phoebe," I can’t believe it! I did it! I rode a bike! I never thought
I’d be able to do that! Thank you Ross."
276,Ross," Oh hey, don’t thank me, thank yourself. You’re the one who faced
her fears and ultimately overcame them."
277,Phoebe," Don’t be so corny Ross, it’s not an after-school special. (She
rides off and the camera pans down to reveal two shiny, silver training wheels firmly
attached.)"
0,Chandler," Buh-bye. (Hangs up the phone) I just got us reservations at
Michelle’s and tickets to the Musicman to celebrate our first holiday season
as a betroughed couple."
1,Monica, Betrothed… (Corrects him)
2,Chandler, …betrothed couple.
3,Phoebe, (entering carrying a skull) Hey!
4,Chandler, Hey!
6,Phoebe, Haaaa... (Puts the skull on the table) ... ahhhh!
7,Chandler, Pheebs?
8,Phoebe, Huh?
9,Chandler, Skull?
10,Phoebe," Oh, yeah, it's my mom's."
11,Rachel, (freaking out) Oh my god!!
12,Phoebe," No, no, no. It's not! It's not my mom. It belonged to mom. Yeah, no, she
used to put it out every Christmas to remind us, that even though it's Christmas, people
still die. And, you can put candy in it. (She grabs the skull, pulls out a stick of
licorice, and takes a bite.)"
13,Ross, (entering) Hey!
15,Monica, (Offering Ross the skull) Licorice?
16,Ross," (Thinking it over) Sure! (Takes one) Hey, I just found out, I get Ben for
the holidays this year."
18,Monica, Are you gonna dress up as Santa?
19,Ross," Nope. I mean, I know Susan does every year, but I think I wanna take this
year to teach him all about Hanukkah."
20,Phoebe," And maybe I could teach Ben about the Christmas skull and how people
die."
21,Rachel, You may need to use this year to teach Ben about Phoebe.
22,Ross, Hmm.
24,Joey, Hey. (He exits)
25,Rachel, (to Monica) Did you know he was in there?
26,Monica, No.
27,Chandler, How long have we been home?
28,Monica, About a half an hour.
29,Chandler, Lovely!
32,Chandler," Hey, you know what I was thinking? When we get married, are you gonna
change your last name to Bing?"
33,Monica, No.
34,Chandler, Why not?
35,Monica, Bing's weird.
36,Phoebe," (entering) Oh, hey, you guys!"
37,Chandler, Hey!
38,Monica, Hey!
39,Phoebe," Hey. Guess what! My landlord just called and my apartment is gonna get
ready soon, so I guess I'll be moving out."
40,Monica," Ahh, Phoebe, I'm gonna miss you!"
41,Phoebe," Yes, you will be very sad. All right, well I gotta go tell Rachel the
good news."
42,Chandler, Ohh! You guys gonna be living together again?
43,Phoebe," Yeah, why not?"
44,Chandler," Well, she's just so much fun with Joey, I just assumed, she'd still be
living with him."
45,Phoebe," Why do you think, she's having so much fun living with Joey?"
46,Chandler," No reason, except…she…told…me."
47,Phoebe," Really? So she said, she didn’t wanna live with me anymore?"
48,Chandler," No! No, she didn't say that. I-I-I think you should talk to Monica
now."
49,Monica," Phoebe, don't worry about it. I'm sure she wants to live with you."
50,Phoebe, You're sure? You're absolutely sure?
51,Monica," Well, no. But, um, I bet she probably does."
52,Phoebe," Probably? Yeah, I don't like that word. (Chandler and Monica look
surprised) Kind of what ‘probably’ really means. Yeah, uh-huh. Yeah, oh,
""Your mom probably won't kill herself,"" y’know? I'm sorry, but I'm not
hanging all my hopes of Rachel and I living together on-on ""Probably!""
Y’know? You gotta take care of yourselves! (She starts to walk out) In this
world history teaches us nothing! (Exits)"
53,Chandler," Bing doesn't seem so weird now, does it?"
55,Rachel, (entering) Hey!
56,Joey," Hey! Great, you’re home! Guess what Phoebe got me for Christmas!
(Starts drumming.)"
57,Rachel, Drums?
58,Joey, (yelling) No! Drums!
60,Chandler," (to the Maitre d') Hi, could we get two burritos to go, please?
(Laughs.)"
61,Monica," I'm sorry. But not that sorry, 'cause you don't have to live with it.
Um, we have a reservation under the name Chandler Bing."
63,Chandler, Forty-five minutes? We have tickets to the Musicman at 800.
65,Chandler, Is this because of the burrito thing?
66,Monica, (pulling Chandler away from the Maitre d') You need to give him money.
67,Chandler, Give him money? It was a joke!
68,Monica," No, to get a table! Places like are always shakin’ you down.
Everybody wants to be paid off."
69,Chandler," Right, calm down, O'Mally. I'll slip him some money."
70,Monica, You've got to be smooth about it.
71,Chandler," Hey, I can be smooth. (Walks back to the Maitre d', very smoothly)
Listen, we're a little bit in a hurry, so, if you can get us a table a little quicker, I'd
appreciate it. (Shakes his hand)"
73,Chandler, Okay. (Walks back to Monica)
74,Monica, How did it go?
75,Chandler," Had the money in the wrong hand. (Shows her his left hand with the
money in it)"
77,Ross," Wooooooo, hehehe. Hey, ahh, you don't feel like you're gonna throw up, do
ya?"
79,Ross," Well, I do, so let's... (Ben and Ross sit down on the couch) So, Ben, you
uh, you know what holiday is coming up, don't ya?"
81,Ross," Yep, and you know what other holiday is coming up?"
83,Ross," Yes, but also (Pauses to let Ben answer, but he doesn’t.) Hanukkah!
See, you're part Jewish, and-and Hanukkah is a Jewish holiday."
85,Ross," Right, um, but, on Hanukkah, Hanukkah is a celebration of a miracle. See,
years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees."
87,Ross," (interrupts him) Okay, that's right, yes, but on Hanukkah, uh, we sing, uh
(Sings) Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made you out of clay."
89,Ross," (interrupts him again) Okay, it's not a contest."
91,Ross," Well, how about this year, instead of Santa, we have fun celebrating
Hanukkah?"
93,Ross," No! Oh, no-no-no. Hey, you weren't bad, you've been very good, Ben."
95,Ross," No, hey-hey, come on, (He grabs Ben and sits him on his lap) Ben, Santa is
not mad at you, okay? Hey, you're-you're his favorite little guy!"
97,Ross, (disappointed) Yes! Santa's coming!
99,Monica," It's easy! Just keep it casual! Give him a kind word, shake his hand and
give him the money!"
100,Chandler, How do you know so much about this?
101,Monica, I don't know.
102,Chandler," Richard used to do it, didn't he?"
103,Monica, We'd be eating our soup right now.
104,Chandler, Mustached bastard…
105,Monica," (sees two people exit) Okay, those people just left, come on! Quick!
Give him the money and get their table!"
106,Chandler, (walks up to the Maitre d') Excuse me...
109,Chandler," (finds his money) Ahh-hahaha! (Turns around to give the Maitre d' his
money, but he isn't there anymore)"
111,Rachel, (stopping at Phoebe’s entrance) Ha!
112,Phoebe," So you like the drums! That's, that's great! Y’know, I was worried,
that, you know, they would maybe an unbearable living situation. All right, okay, well,
apparently not! So, yay!"
113,Joey," Hey-hey, Pheebs, check it out, we already learned a song. (To Rachel)
Ready? One, two, three, four..."
116,Phoebe, That's fun. (She exits disappointedly.)
120,Chandler," Thank you Gunther, put it there. (He gets up, and shakes Gunther's
hand. A bunch of coins fall out his hand. He sits down next to Monica.) Definitely not
easier with coins. (Joey gets up and picks up the coins. Chandler thinks, Joey is just
helping him to pick them up.) Thank you."
121,Joey," Thank you. (He gets up and puts on his jacket.) (Phoebe enters) Hey
Pheebs!"
122,Phoebe, Hey!
123,Joey, Here. (Gives her the coins) Now I only owe you $49.50.
124,Chandler, Hey Pheebs!
125,Phoebe, Hey! (she sits down next to him)
126,Chandler," If you wanna give Joey a Christmas present that disrupts the entire
building, why not get him something a little bit more subtle, like a wrecking ball, or a
vile of small pox to release in the hallway?"
127,Monica," It's not just the drum noise. Every five minutes, Joey throws his sticks
in the air, and I have to hear, ""Oh my eye! Oh god, my eye!"" I mean, it is so
annoying."
128,Phoebe," Yes, thank you. You see, this is how normal people are supposed to react
to drums."
129,Monica," Phoebe, you got Joey drums to annoy Rachel, so she wouldn't wanna live
there anymore?"
130,Phoebe, Maybe on some level.
132,Rachel," Joey, y’know that you could just not throw the sticks up in the
air."
133,Joey, What is Rock 'n' Roll about that?
134,Phoebe," (entering with an aquarium covered by a towel) Hey, Joey, I got you
another present. (She puts it on the counter)"
135,Joey," Oh wait, before you tell me what it is! (He plays a drum-roll) Okay, what
is it?"
136,Phoebe," It's a…tarantula! (Joey almost falls down from his drum-stool
jumping up) Oh! God! Rachel, look, I'm sorry. What was I thinking giving Joey this big,
gross, scary spider in such a poorly constructed cage?"
137,Rachel," What are you talking about? I love them! (Looks into the cage) Yeah, I
had a tarantula when I was a kid. But it-it died, because my cat ate it. And then, then my
cat died. But Joey, isn't this cool?"
138,Joey," Is it on me? I feel, I feel like it's on me! I got, hey! (He storms into
his room)"
139,Rachel," Oh, isn't that adorable? Joey is afraid of the tarantula."
140,Phoebe," (sarcastic) Ah, yeah, he's so adorable, God, he's just so much fun, Joey
is the best, I'm glad you're having so much fun here. (She turns around, about to leave)"
141,Rachel," What? Wait-wait a minute, what? Phoebe, what's the matter?"
142,Phoebe, Our apartment is ready.
143,Rachel, And that makes you angry because…
144,Phoebe, Because you would rather live here with Joey.
145,Rachel, Where did you get that?
146,Phoebe," Monica and Chandler said that you were having so much fun here. And
apparently no amount of drums or tarantulas is gonna change that."
147,Rachel, Phoebe?
148,Phoebe, Hm?
149,Rachel," Did you get all this stuff for Joey to try and drive me out of the
apartment? Honey, if you wanted to do that, you might as well just gotten him a fish, you
know how fish freaked me out!"
150,Phoebe, (nods along) Fish!
151,Rachel," It wouldn't have mattered anyway, Phoebe, you and I are, are gonna live
together, we're roommates; that's the deal."
152,Phoebe," Yes, but I wanted you to want to live with me, but okay, if you're
having so much fun over here…"
153,Rachel," Oh, it's so much more fun with you."
154,Phoebe," We did have fun, didn't we?"
155,Rachel, We did!
156,Phoebe," Oh, anyway, they say, if we want, we can see it tonight."
157,Rachel," Oh, I would love to!"
158,Phoebe," Yay, okay!"
159,Rachel," Good, good, good, good, good. (She runs to the drums and gets the
sticks)"
160,Phoebe," Great, all right, okay, and Monica ask me to make the drumming stop."
161,Rachel," (with the sticks in her hands) Um... (She goes to the tarantula-cage and
puts the sticks into it) Done!"
163,Ross, Hey!
165,Ross," No, these are my pants."
167,Ross," Well, uh, do you have a Santa-outfit left?"
169,Ross," Okay look, do-do, you have anything Christmassy? I promised my son, and I
really don't want to disappoint him, um, come on, I…uh, you gotta have something."
171,Ross," I'm the holiday armadillo! I'm a friend of Santa's and he sent me here to
wish you (Points to Ben) a Merry Christmas!"
172,Monica," What happened to Santa, Holiday Armadillo?"
173,Ross, (to Monica) Santa was unavailable so close to Christmas.
174,Monica," Wow, come in, have a seat. You must be exhausted coming all the way
from…Texas."
176,Ross," That's right, Ben. I'm Santa's representative for all the southern states.
And Mexico! But, Santa sent me here to give you these presents, Ben. (He tries to bend
down to pick up the bag with the presents, but can't because of the costume) Maybe the
Lady will help me with these presents."
179,Ross," You're welcome, Ben. Merry Christmas, ooh, and Happy Hanukkah!"
181,Ross," (gasps) You are? Me, too!"
182,Monica, Because Armadillos also wandered in the desert?
183,Ross," (to Monica) You wanna wander in the hall? (to Ben) Ooh, hey Ben, what if
the Holiday Armadillo told you all about the festival of lights?"
185,Ross, Yeah!
186,Monica, Come on Ben.
188,Ross, Years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees...
189,Chandler," (entering in a Santa costume) Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!"
191,Chandler, Hey! (Grunts as Ben hits him at full speed.)
192,Ross," What are you doing here, Santa?"
193,Chandler," Well, I'm here to see my old buddy Ben. What are you doing here,
weird…turtle-man?"
194,Ross," I'm the Holiday Armadillo, your part-Jewish friend. You sent me here to
give Ben some presents. Remember?"
195,Chandler, What?
197,Chandler," You bet I did, Ben, put it there! (He shakes Ben's hand, but the money
falls out of his hands) (to Monica) Well, it would have worked this time, if his hands
weren't so damn small! (Realizes, that Ben is standing right there) Ho, ho, ho!"
198,Monica," Okay Ben, why don't you come open some more presents, and Santa, the
Armadillo, and I have a little talk in the kitchen? There's a sentence, I never thought
I'd say."
200,Ross, (to Chandler) What are you doing?
201,Chandler," You called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a Santa
costume, so I borrowed one from a guy at work!"
202,Ross," Thank you, but, but you gotta leave."
203,Chandler, Why?
204,Ross," Because, I'm finally getting him excited about Hanukkah, and, and
you're-you’re wrecking it."
205,Chandler, But I didn't get to shape my belly like a bowl full of jelly.
206,Ross," I'm sorry, Chandler but this, this is really important to me."
207,Chandler," Fine, I'll give the suit back."
209,Monica," (to Chandler) Hey, you think, you can keep it another night? (She has a
really teasing look on her face and keeps twirling Chandler's beard.)"
210,Chandler, Santa? Really?
211,Monica," Yes, is that okay?"
212,Chandler, Did your Dad ever dress up like Santa?
213,Monica, No.
214,Chandler, Then it's okay! (They kiss.)
215,Ross," Okay Ben, Santa has to go. Say good-bye!"
217,Chandler," Because, if Santa and the Holiday…Armadillo? (Ross nods) ...are
ever in the same room for too long the universe will implode. Merry Christmas!"
219,Ross," Fine, I-I give up. Santa, Santa can stay."
220,Chandler," Well, I'll stay, but only because I wanna hear about Hanukkah. Ben,
will you sit here with Santa and learn about Hanukkah?"
223,Ross," All right, it's time for the story of Hanukkah. Years and years ago, there
were these people called the Maccabees."
225,Joey, (entering wearing a Superman costume) Merry Christmas!
227,Rachel, Oh wow! Look at this place!
228,Phoebe," Oh, this is terrible. Oh, they’ve made so many changes I can’t
even feel my grandmother’s presence anymore—Ooh! New sconces!"
229,Rachel, (yelling from another room) Oh my God!
230,Phoebe, What?
231,Rachel," (returning) Okay, remember uh, remember how you told me that your
grandmother put up that wall to make that into two bedrooms?"
232,Phoebe, Yeah?
233,Rachel," And remember how you always said you were afraid the landlord would find
out and then tear it down?"
234,Phoebe, Yeah?
235,Rachel," Do you really not know where I’m going with this? (Phoebe nods,
""No."") It left! It’s one huge room!"
236,Phoebe," Oh no! (She runs to see.) (Running back, excitedly) Oh! Wow!!!"
237,Rachel, See?
238,Phoebe," Well, I guess we’ll just have to put the wall back up."
239,Rachel," You can’t, because of the new skylight!"
240,Phoebe," There’s a skylight?! (Runs to see and yells from the bedroom.)
Wow!!"
241,Rachel, So what should we do? Should we start looking for a new place?
242,Phoebe," (returning slowly) Y’know I’m-I’m sensing that um, my
grandmother would not be comfortable with that."
243,Rachel, Oh yeah? Startin’ to feel her again there are we?
244,Phoebe," A little bit, yeah."
245,Rachel, Pheebs is your grandmother maybe saying that you should live here alone?
246,Phoebe, You heard her too?! You have the gift!
247,Rachel," Phoebe, it’s okay. I like living with Joey."
248,Phoebe, Are you sure?
249,Rachel," Oh please, I hate packing, it’s closer to work, and we do have fun.
Although, I’m really gonna miss living with you."
250,Phoebe, Oh me too.
251,Rachel," I know. (They hug.) Oh-oh, wait did you hear that-hear that? Listen,
I’m gettin’ something from your grandmother, she said that since you get to keep
the one bedroom apartment you should give Rachel the purple chair?"
252,Phoebe," No, I do not hear that."
254,Ross," …and the miracle was that that little bit of oil that should’ve
just lasted just one day, burned for…"
256,Ross," That’s right, and that’s why we celebrate Hanukkah today. The
end."
258,Ross, Yeah?
259,Chandler," My favorite part was when Superman flew all the Jews out of
Egypt. (Glaring at Joey who’s nodding.)"
260,Ross," The Armadillo was actually not so thrilled about that part! Okay
Ben, it’s time to light the Hanukkah candles! (Santa, Superman, Monica, Ben,
and the Holiday Armadillo go over to the menorah to light the candles.)"
261,Rachel, (entering with Phoebe) Hey! 
262,Phoebe, Oh.
263,Rachel," (seeing the collection of characters.) Wow! It looks like the Easter
Bunny’s funeral in here."
264,Ross," Come on, come on, we’re-we’re-we’re lighting the candles!"
265,Rachel, Oh.
266,Phoebe, Oh.
268,Phoebe," Okay, I understand why Superman is here, but why is there a
porcupine at the Easter Bunny’s funeral?"
271,Rachel, I got it!
272,Joey, (yelling from the bedroom) Is it back in the cage?
273,Rachel, Its back in cage!
274,Joey, Cage closed?
275,Rachel," Joey, would you just come out here and stop being such a baby!"
0,Chandler, Ohh. Mmm.
1,Rachel, (Comes in the front door and walks towards the kitchen.) Hi.
2,Chandler," Hey, you have got to try this cheesecake."
3,Rachel," Oh, y’know I'm not that much of a sweet tooth. I—(Chandler
puts a forkful of the cheesecake in her mouth.)—Wow. My God, so creamy. Oh my God,
this is the best cheesecake I have ever had. Where did you get this? (She reaches over to
look at the label on the box.)"
4,Chandler," (nervously) It was at the front door. When I got home. Somebody sent
it to us."
5,Rachel," Chandler, this is not addressed to you. This is addressed to Mrs.
Braverman downstairs. (Gasping) Thief."
6,Chandler," I—no! I didn't read the box before I opened it. And you can't
return a box after you've opened the box."
7,Rachel," Why, why not?"
8,Chandler, Because it's too delicious.
9,Rachel," Chandler, you stole this cheesecake. That is wrong."
10,Chandler," No-no-no! It is going to be okay, because Mrs. Braverman is gonna send
away for a free one and that way we all win! The only losers are the big cheesecake
conglomerate, (Reading the label) Momma’s Little Bakery. (Pause) I feel terrible,
I’m a horrible, horrible, horrible person."
11,Rachel," (taking a bite) Oh, I’m sorry what?"
14,Joey," All right, I should get going, big day a work. Y’know I’m in a
coma? Today, they do this test on me and it turns out I’m not brain dead."
15,Chandler, So…
16,Joey," Ah-ah-ah Mr. Smartie Pants, it’s just not my character that’s
not brain dead. Hey, so Pheebs, we still on for tonight?"
17,Phoebe, Absolutely!
18,Joey, I’ll see you at 800.
19,Phoebe, Okay. (Joey exits.) 
20,Chandler," Oh, what’s at 800?"
21,Phoebe," Oh, I have dinner plans with Joey. We get together about once a month to
discuss the rest of you guys."
22,Ross," Wow, did not know that! May I say how lovely you look today?"
23,Phoebe, Duly noted.
24,Ross," Thanks. (Phoebe gets up to get a refill.) (To Monica) Oh! So for tomorrow,
do you want to rent a car and drive down together or what?"
25,Monica, What are you talking about?
26,Ross," Cousin Frannie’s wedding, its tomorrow night."
27,Monica, You were invited?!
28,Ross, No.
29,Monica," My God, I can’t believe this! I mean I knew that mom and dad were
invited, but I thought that was it! I mean from the ages 7 to 9 Frannie and I were
inseparable!"
30,Chandler," Well, maybe since the age of 9, Frannie’s made some new friends."
31,Ross," Well l-look okay, it’s probably just a mistake. Let me call Aunt
Sheryl okay? Maybe you are invited and the invitation just got lost in the mail."
32,Monica," Yeah, well you call her and tell her that y’know when we were kids
her precious little Frannie tried to undress me several times, okay? And if I hadn’t
have stopped her, there probably wouldn’t even be a wedding to go too."
33,Ross," Y’know, she tried to undress me too."
34,Chandler," I used to undress my cousin Glenn. (Monica looks at him then sushes
him.)"
36,Phoebe, Joseph Francis Tribbiani are you home yet?!!
37,Rachel," Umm, I think he’s still out. What’s wrong?"
38,Phoebe," Well, I’ll tell you Rachel Karen Green, I had plans with Joey
tonight and he left me this note. (Hands it to Rachel.)"
39,Rachel," (reading the note) ""Pheebs, can’t make it, got a date. Talk to
you later. Big Daddy."" (Laughs) Big Daddy?"
40,Phoebe, Oh that’s a nickname we were trying out.
41,Ross," Hey, y’know what nickname never caught on? The Ross-A-Tron! (Monica
shakes her head in disgust.)"
42,Joey, (entering) Hey!
43,Phoebe, Oh! Here’s Joseph Francis!
44,Joey, Oh-Wha-Ho! What are you middle naming me for?! I left you a note!
45,Phoebe, So what?! That doesn’t give you the right to ditch me!
46,Joey," Hey, you can cancel plans with friends if there is the possibility for
sex!"
47,Ross," Phoebe he’s right, that is the rule."
48,Phoebe," I don’t accept this rule. When me make plans, I expect you to show
up. Okay, I can’t just be a way to kill time ‘til you meet someone better!
Y’know boyfriends and girlfriends come and go, but this (Motions that their
friendship) is for life!"
49,Joey, Wow! I’m so sorry; I had no idea it would bother you this much.
50,Phoebe," Well, it does."
51,Joey," Okay, can I-can I make it up to you? Huh? I’m sorry. (They hug.) How
about uh, dinner tomorrow night?! I’ll pay for myself!"
52,Phoebe," Okay, you wore me down."
53,Ross," Hey Joe, while you’re over there how about another beer for the
Ross-A-Tron?"
54,Joey, The Ross—Is that back?!! (Chandler motions no.)
56,Rachel, Hi!
57,Chandler, Another cheesecake came! They delivered it to the wrong address again!
58,Rachel," So just bring it back downstairs, what’s the problem?"
59,Chandler, I can’t seem to say goodbye.
60,Rachel," Are you serious?! Chandler, we ate an entire cheesecake two days ago and
you want more?"
61,Chandler, Well I’ve forgotten what it tastes like okay?!
62,Rachel," It was cheesecake. It was fine. It had a buttery, crumbly, graham
cracker crust, with a very rich yet light, cream cheese filling… (Pause) Wow! My
whole mouth just filled with saliva! "
63,Chandler," (closing the box) Y’know what? Forget it! We are just
hungry! We have not had lunch! We are just light-headed! So let us go out and have lunch
and forget about the cheesecake."
64,Rachel," Yeah and we’ll drop it off downstairs so that we’re not
tempted."
65,Chandler, Good idea. Where do you want to go to lunch?
66,Rachel," Momma’s Little Bakery, Chicago, Illinois. (They exit with the
cheesecake.)"
68,Joey, Awww! Mel Torme died.
69,Monica," Joey, that paper’s like a year old!"
70,Joey, Aw! Does that mean the Sam Goody’s sale is over?!
71,Ross, (entering) Hey.
72,Joey, Hey.
73,Monica, Hey.
74,Ross," So I finally heard back from Aunt Sheryl and apparently it wasn’t
a mistake. Ahh, there’s-there’s limited seating in the hall."
75,Monica, Limited seating?! (Screechingly) I am just one tiny person!
76,Ross," Well yeah, but she doesn’t know that. I mean, the last time she saw
you-you would’ve turned one of those little wedding chairs into kindling. "
77,Monica," (disgusted) Limited seating! Oh, that is such a lame excuse! That’s
not the reason she’s not inviting me!"
78,Ross," Oh what’s the big deal?! I wasn’t even invited to the ceremony,
just the reception. And-and y’know what? If it makes you feel any better, Joan and I
will just make an appearance and then, and then we’ll-we’ll leave early as a
sign of protest."
79,Monica, Joan?
80,Ross," Yeah, Joan Tedeski my date. She’s an assistant professor in the
Linguistics department. Tall, very beautiful, and despite what some people say, not
broad backed!"
81,Monica," Wait a minute, you got Ross Gellar and guest?! I wasn’t invited and
you got ""and guest?!"""
82,Joey," Uh-uh, excuse me, I do have to interrupt on Ross’s behalf. I-I think
the rule applies here y’know, since she has a chance to get on broad back…"
83,Ross, (interrupting) Not broad backed!
84,Monica," Wait a minute, y’know, you’re bringing me!"
85,Ross, What? I can’t cancel on Joan!
86,Monica, Why not?!
87,Ross," Bec—Did you not hear me?! She’s an assistant professor in the
Linguistics department, okay? They’re wild! Why do you want to come anyway?"
88,Monica," Because! She’s my cousin. I mean, we grew up together! We’re
family y’know? Well that’s important to me."
89,Ross," Okay, all right, I’ll take you. I’ll go call Joan. (Does so.)"
90,Joey," Aww that’s nice. Family should be there, huh? This is her wedding,
happiest day of her life."
91,Monica, (laughs) We’ll see.
93,Chandler," Well, thank you for lunch."
94,Rachel," What? Wait a minute, I didn’t pay, I thought you paid!"
95,Chandler," So apparently we just don’t pay for food anymore. (Rachel laughs
then Chandler notices something.) Do you see what I see?"
96,Rachel," (gasps) Its still there! (The cheesecake they returned to Mrs. Braverman
is still lying in front of her door.)"
97,Chandler, Mrs. Braverman must be out. (They move closer to it.)
98,Rachel, She could be out of town. Maybe she’ll be gone for months.
99,Chandler," By then, the cheesecake may have gone bad. We don’t want her to
come back to bad cheesecake."
100,Rachel, No that could kill her.
101,Chandler," Well, we don’t want that."
102,Rachel, No so we’re protecting her.
103,Chandler, But we should take it.
104,Rachel, But we should move quick.
105,Chandler, Why?
106,Rachel, Because I think I just heard her moving around in there.
107,Chandler," Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! (Rachel grabs the cheesecake
and they take off upstairs.)"
109,Phoebe, (gasps) (whispering) Oh my God! That’s David!
110,Monica, David who?
111,Phoebe," David the scientist guy, David that I was in love with, David who went
to Russia and broke my heart David!"
113,Phoebe," Oh, you say someone’s name enough, they turn around."
115,Phoebe," David! (He kisses her cheek) What-what are you doing here? Aren’t
you supposed to be in Russia?"
117,Phoebe, Well… Yeah. You look great too. Did you get a haircut?
119,Phoebe, Yeah.
121,Phoebe, Uh-huh.
123,Phoebe," Well, of course I would want to see you. I…I think about you all
the time."
125,Phoebe, Really?
127,Phoebe, Uh-huh.
129,Phoebe, Yeah.
131,Phoebe, (excited) Yes! Oh no! 
133,Phoebe," I can’t. I can’t believe I have plans, I can’t. Can you
do it tomorrow night though?"
135,Monica," Phoebe, can I talk to you for a second?"
136,Phoebe, Uh-huh. (They go over and talk.)
137,Monica, What are you doing?
138,Phoebe," Well, I have plans with Joey tonight."
139,Monica, So! He’ll understand!
140,Phoebe," No he won’t. And that’s not even the point! Monica, I made a
whole speech about you do not cancel plans with friends! And now y’know what? Just
because, potentially, the love of my life comes back from Russia just for one night, I-I
should change my beliefs?! I should change beliefs! No! No! No, if I don’t have my
principles, I don’t have anything!"
141,Monica," God, you are so strong."
142,Phoebe, Or! I should rush through dinner with Joey and I can meet David at 900!
145,Rachel, (taking a bite) Oh my God! That is so good!
146,Chandler," I’m full, and yet I know if I stop eating this, I’ll regret
it."
147,Joey, (entering) Hey!
148,Rachel, Hey!
149,Joey, (seeing what they’re doing) What do you got there?
150,Rachel," Oh it’s umm, it’s tofu cake. Do you want some? (He makes a
disgusted noise and heads for his room, Chandler follows him in.)"
151,Chandler, What are you doing tonight?
152,Joey, Huh? Uh… (He starts taking off his pants.)
153,Chandler, Dude! Dude! (Motions that Joey should pull up his pants.)
154,Joey," Oh! (Pulls up his pants.) Sorry. Uh, I’ve got those plans with
Phoebe, why?"
155,Chandler," Oh really? Uh, Monica said she had a date at 900."
156,Joey, What?! Tonight?!
157,Chandler, That’s what Monica said.
158,Joey," After she gave me that big speech?! She goes and makes a date with a guy
on the same night she has plans with me? I think she’s trying to pull a fast one on
Big Daddy!"
160,Ross," Oh here, I think this is us. (Reading the name cards.) Yeah."
161,Monica," Limited seating my ass. Let’s see who made the cut. (To the couple
sitting to her right.) Hi!"
163,Monica, I’m Monica Gellar. Who do you know the bride and groom?
165,Monica," Used to work with her. Used to! I’m a relative and I didn’t
get invited! A blood relative! Blood!!"
166,Ross," (To Monica) Stop saying, ""Blood"" to strangers."
167,Monica," (to the couple on her left) So, how about you huh? How do you know the
happy couple?"
169,Monica," Okay, you’re fine."
172,Phoebe, Hey!
174,Phoebe," Yes! I will have the green salad, umm the house salad, and water’s
fine."
176,Phoebe, Okay. 
178,Joey," Yeah, this slow roasted salmon, just how slow are we talkin’ here?"
180,Joey," Ohh, then no. Maybe I should hear those specials again."
181,Phoebe," Oh Joey, we’ve heard the specials three times! Okay? There’s
prime rib, mahi mahi, and a very special lobster ravioli. (She grabs his menu and hands it
to the waiter.)"
183,Joey," Oh well, that changes everything! (Grabs his menu and starts looking at it
again. The waiter leaves.) Y’know what Pheebs?"
184,Phoebe, Huh?
185,Joey," You were right before. I mean, friends are so important."
186,Phoebe," (checking her watch) Yeah, I’m very wise. I know."
187,Joey, Y’know-y’know what I really want?
188,Phoebe, What?
189,Joey," Is to have a long, long talk. Y’know? Get Joey out on the open road
and really open him up."
191,Joey, Yes! I will have the lobster ravioli.
192,Phoebe," God Joey, this is taking forever!"
193,Joey, What’s the rush? What?
194,Phoebe," W-w—I just—it’s that—I have—y’know I
have-I have an appointment. And it’s very important."
195,Joey," Whoa-whoa, what is it?"
196,Phoebe, Well… It’s a date.
197,Joey," A date?! No, no Pheebs you-you must be mistaken, because I know you
wouldn’t schedule a date on the same night you have plans with a friend!"
198,Phoebe," Come on Joey, don’t make me feel badly about this."
199,Joey," No, I’m gonna!! That’s right! Yeah, you made me feel really
guilty about goin’ out with that girl! Like-like-like I did something terrible to
you! And now Pheebs, you’re doing the same thing!"
200,Phoebe," That—It’s not the same thing! This is totally
different! This is with David! Remember David, the scientist guy? Okay, he’s very
special to me."
201,Joey," Okay, well my girl from the other night was special. She was a scientist
too!"
202,Phoebe, She was?
203,Joey," Well, she graduated from high school!"
204,Phoebe," Okay, whatever. Y’know what? I don’t have time have time to
convince you because he’s only here for four hours, and I’m gonna go see him!
(Gets up and leaves.)"
205,Joey, Fine!
206,Phoebe, Yeah!
207,Joey, Fine!
208,Phoebe, Yeah! (She exits.)
209,Joey," (to the waiter) What are you still doin’ here?! I told you, lobster
ravioli!"
211,Phoebe, Hey!
213,Phoebe," Oh, I wouldn’t miss this."
215,Phoebe," Oh, you’re such a gentleman. (Grabs his arm.) Come on! We’re
going to my place! (Drags him off to her place.)"
217,Chandler, Are you eating the cheesecake without me?!
218,Rachel, (with a mouthful) Mm-mmm. (Nods no.)
219,Chandler," I will give you a hundred dollars to whistle right now. (She tries to
whistle and blows little chunks of cheesecake out of her mouth.) How can you eat the
cheesecake without me?!"
220,Rachel," Oh, what are you going to do?! Are you gonna go run tell Monica?! Are
you gonna tell Joey?! No! Because then you will have to tell them what we did! We are
desert stealers! We are living outside the law!"
221,Chandler," Y’know what? I don’t trust you with this cake anymore! And I
got it first, and I’m takin’ it back! (Grabs the cheesecake and heads for his
apartment.)"
222,Rachel, What?! What?!
223,Chandler, Oh yes! 
224,Rachel, Wait a minute!
225,Chandler, Oh yes!
226,Rachel," Oh no-no-no-no-no, no you don’t!"
228,Chandler, Oh yes! Oh yes!
229,Rachel," You think I trust you with it?! No! We’re gonna split it! You take
half and I take half!"
230,Chandler," Well that’s not fair, you’ve already had some!"
231,Rachel," What? Oh, well then y’know what? I think Monica would be very
interested to know that you called her cheesecake dry and mealy."
232,Chandler, What do we use to split it?
233,Rachel," Okay! (Grabs a knife and cuts it in half.) All right, pick a half."
234,Chandler," (examining the cake) Okay well, this side looks bigger. Uh…
There’s more crust on this side. Y’know? So, maybe if I measured…"
235,Rachel, Oh for God sake just pick a piece!
236,Chandler," All right, I’ll pick that one. (Points.)"
237,Rachel," That’s also the smaller piece. (Puts the piece onto a plate.) Okay,
there you go. Enjoy your half my friend, but that is it. No sharing. No switching, and
don’t come crying to me if you eat your piece to fast. (As she’s saying
that she is backing out the door, when she finishes she turns around to return to her
place, stumbles and drops the cheesecake on the floor.) Oh!!!!"
238,Chandler, (gloatingly and holding his piece) Ohhh!
239,Rachel," Okay, you gotta give me some of your piece."
240,Chandler," Oh-ho-ho-ho-no! No! No switching! No sharing, and don’t come
crying to me! Ha-ha-ha! I may just sit here and have my cake all day! Just sit here in the
hallway and eat my… (Rachel knocks the plate from his hand and it falls on the floor.
That process leaves just the forkful Chandler has, Rachel starts to go after that little
bit and Chandler retreats into his apartment.) "
243,Ross," Oh, hey Aunt Millie."
245,Ross," Yes, yes it is. It’s uh… (Aunt Millie uses this opportunity to
grab Ross and kiss him on the lips. After she leaves Ross quickly wipes his mouth with a
napkin.) Every time on the lips! Why?! Why on lips?!"
247,Monica," Here’s Frannie. Hmm, won’t she be happy to see me? (Starts to
get up and great Frannie.)"
248,Ross," Now wait a minute, you be nice! All right? I didn’t bring you here so
you can ambush her."
249,Monica," Frannie was the one who found your Playboys and showed them to
mom."
250,Ross," That bitch! (He gets up and they go over to ambush Frannie. Monica taps on
Frannie’s shoulder.)"
252,Monica," Am I doing here? Why? Surprised to see me? Ross brought me. How do you
like that?!"
253,Ross," (to Frannie) Hi Frannie, congratulations."
254,Monica," You invite my brother, you invite my whole family, and not me?! Why?!
What—Why wouldn’t you want me at your wedding? What could I have possibly done?!
(Frannie’s husband walks up.) Stuart!"
257,Ross, So it’s really a question of who could you have possibly done.
260,Phoebe," Are you sure? I’ll bet there’s another flight to Minsk in
like…"
262,Phoebe, That’s really beautiful. What does it mean?
264,Phoebe," That’s good. I got to admit, I thought it was something else."
266,Phoebe, You’re right! You’re right. Don’t say it. 
268,Phoebe, I do too. (They kiss.)
270,Phoebe," (seeing him) Okay, now’s not the time Joey. All right? You can yell
at me tomorrow."
271,Joey," No! No! No Pheebs, I’m not gonna yell at you. I just y’know,
started thinking about you and David and I…remember how bummed you were the first
time he left. And I just… Oh Pheebs, come here. (He hugs her.) Are you okay?"
272,Phoebe," No I’m not okay. The only guy I’ve ever been crazy about has
gone to Minsk and I may never…I may never see him again. (Crying.)"
273,Joey," Hey, y’know you could always visit him."
274,Phoebe," Oh right, like they’re gonna let me have a passport."
275,Joey, Anything I can do? Whatever you need.
276,Phoebe," Well—But—Now, if-if you can achieve positronic distillation of
sub-atomic particles y’know before he does, then he can come back. (They hug again.)"
277,Joey, I can give it a shot.
279,Rachel, Oh! Yay! Look! There’s a piece that doesn’t have floor on it!
280,Chandler, Stick to your side!
281,Rachel," Hey, come on now!"
283,Joey," (pulls out a fork) All right, what are we havin’? (Starts digging
in.)"
286,Monica, Oh wait I forgot my wrap.
287,Ross," What? Oh, okay. Wait here. (Goes to get it, but before he gets there Aunt
Millie sits down on it forcing him to pull it out from behind her which gets her
attention.)"
289,Ross, Well…
292,Ross," Why?! Why on the lips?! (He wipes his mouth on Monica’s wrap and
walks off, leaving Aunt Millie stunned.)"
0,Monica," (looking up) Ross, when’s this comet thing start?"
1,Ross," Well, technically it seven billion years ago… (Well,
technically you’d be able to see it for days, well nights; that is if you could see
it with all of the bright lights of New York.)"
3,Ross," Okay! Okay! Fine, I’ll stop! No teaching, okay? We’ll just watch
the pretty light streaking across the sky. (Comets don’t streak across the sky,
meteors do.) Okay? Who’s official name is Bapstein-King."
5,Phoebe," (looking up) There it is! Oh, look at that! Isn’t Mother Nature
amazing?"
6,Chandler, (looking up with her) That’s a plane!
7,Phoebe," Well, all right. 1700 bags of peanuts flying that high, that’s
pretty amazing too."
9,Rachel," No. No, you can’t."
11,Rachel, Oh I don’t-I don’t know.
12,Ross," Man, look at all those stars! (Yeah, you can see what? Five of them from
the city?) Infinite space. It really, really makes you wonder, doesn’t it?"
13,Joey," (looking through his binoculars at a nearby building) Y’know what
else makes you wonder?"
14,Ross, Huh?
15,Joey," Check out the rack on this chick! (Turns around to point it out to Ross
and finds that Ross is glaring at him. So he quickly puts his binoculars to his eyes and
starts looking for the comet.)"
18,Monica," Okay, we’ve been out here for two hours and we haven’t seen
any stupid comets. Can we go now? I mean, Chandler’s getting chilly. (She walks over
to where Chandler is bundled up in a big coat and shivering.)"
19,Chandler," (with a quivering voice) No, I’m not!"
20,Joey, Then why are you wearing Monica’s jacket?
21,Chandler," Because it’s flattering! (Shivers harder) Come on Monica! Come on
Monica! (He goes inside.)"
22,Rachel," Yeah actually, I think we’re gonna take off too. We rented a movie."
23,Phoebe," Oh! I won’t say, ‘no’ to a movie!"
24,Rachel," Uh Pheebs, we just actually kinda wanted to be alone."
25,Phoebe, Shh! Get me out of here.
26,Rachel," Oh. (They leave, leaving just Joey and Ross.)"
27,Joey, (whispering) Ross!
28,Ross, What?
29,Joey," Come here, check this out!"
30,Ross, What? Is it the comet? (Runs over to where Joey’s standing.)
31,Joey," No! No-no. Look, there’s a bug stuck in tar right here. (Bends down
to get a closer look.)"
32,Ross," Joey come—I can’t believe—I bring you here to see the
Bapstein-King comet, one of nature’s most spectacular phenomenon, and all you care
about are bugs stuck in tar and-and some woman!"
33,Joey," (standing up) Y’know, there’s two women dude."
34,Ross, Show me where?
35,Joey, Right-right up here. (Starts looking at them through a piece of pipe.)
36,Ross," (noticing the pipe and looking at the door) Joey where’s the pipe
that was holding the door open?"
37,Joey," (annoyed) I don’t know! (Goes back to looking through the pipe.)
(Pause) Yeah, I do."
38,Ross, Joey!
39,Joey," What?! All right—Hey! Don’t look at me! You’re the one who
wanted to come up and look for some stupid Burger King comet!"
40,Ross," It’s called the Bapstein-King comet, okay? (Joey starts to groan.)
Hey! Hey! Bapstein was a very well respected astronomer! "
41,Joey," (covering his ears and yelling) Oh no! No! No! (He starts banging on the
door.)"
43,Chandler, (whispering) Monica!
44,Monica, She’s sleeping.
45,Chandler," I know, just quick-quick question, quick question. Which one was Deep
Impact and which one was Armageddon?"
46,Monica," Deep Impact was the one with Robert Duval, Armageddon is
what’s going to happen to you if you wake me up."
47,Chandler," Sorry, I just…can’t sleep. Ooh! (Turns on the light and
Monica groans.) Where is that book that you are reading with the two women who were
ice-skating and wearing, wearing those hats with the flowers on it? Because every time I
look at that cover I’m like…(Fake snores.)"
48,Monica," It is in the living room where there is also a light! And no one will
kick you in the shin."
49,Chandler," What?! (Monica kicks him in the shin.) Ow! (He gets out of bed and
heads into the living room.)"
51,Phoebe," (crossing her fingers and closing her eyes) Please don’t be a space
ship. Please don’t be a space ship. (She turns on the light and looks around and
finds that it’s the smoke detector that’s beeping.) Oh thank God! (She moves a
chair over and starts to investigate how to make the beeping turn off, in frustration she
yanks the thing off of the wall. She sets it down and heads for bed, just as she gets
there it beeps again. She opens the cover and removes the battery, but it still beeps.)
How could you be beeping?! I just disconnected you! I took out your battery! How can…"
53,Phoebe, Don’t interrupt me!!
55,Ross, Rachel!! Monica!!
56,Joey, Come on!
58,Ross, I can’t believe this!!
59,Joey," All right well, y’know…I guess we know what we have to do to get
down."
60,Ross," (standing at the edge of the roof) Yeah, I guess we don’t have a
choice. (Screaming to the street) Help us! Please help us! We’re stuck up on the roof
and we can’t get down!!!"
61,Joey," Ross. I was thinking we could just go down the fire escape. (Points it
out.)"
62,Ross," (To Joey) I know, I wasn’t finished. (Joey motions him to finish.)
(Yelling at the street) But don’t worry! We’re gonna go down the fire escape!!"
64,Chandler," Shhhhhhhhh!!! (Monica enters) I’m sorry, I thought maybe I’d
make some warm milk and it would help me sleep."
65,Monica," With a wok? (Chandler’s holding a wok.) I thought you were going to
read my boring book to put you asleep."
66,Chandler, It got interesting! Damn you Oprah!
67,Monica," Here, let me make the milk, I’m up anyway."
68,Chandler," Hey, y’know what we can do? Y’know, now that we are up? We
can just like talk to each other all night long, y’know like we did when we were
first going out. It’d be fun!"
69,Monica, Okay that does sound like fun. 
70,Chandler," Okay, so how bummed were you when the second sister died huh?"
71,Monica, The second sister dies?!
72,Chandler," (Pause) No. No, I-I was, I was talking about the book I was reading."
73,Monica, The second sister dies in Archie and Jughead Double Digest?
74,Chandler, That’s correct.
76,Rachel, You wanna go in the bedroom? It’s a little more comfortable.
78,Rachel," Okay. (They start to head for the bedroom) Oh wait! Umm, did you send
those contracts to Milan?"
80,Rachel," No seriously, y’know the contracts I gave you, did you overnight
them?"
82,Rachel," Okay please tell me that this is just one of your jokes that you do that
I don’t get."
84,Rachel," Y’know, like the thing when you put the phone in your pants? (He
starts laughing.) Tag! I’m serious! This isn’t funny! Those contracts absolutely
had to go out today!"
86,Rachel," Yes I did! And I put a little Post-It on it that said, ""Must
go out today,"" and underlined today three times and, and then I put a little heart in
the corner because I didn’t want to seem to bossy."
88,Rachel," Y’know what Tag, if we went down to the office you would see those
contracts sitting on your desk."
90,Rachel," Or maybe you would see me looking embarrassed because you are talking on
the phone with your crotch!"
92,Rachel," No! Come on its late, we’re not gonna go down to the office."
94,Rachel," Okay get your coat! (They get their coats and start to leave. Rachel
suddenly stops and sticks the hand up the back of her shirt.) Oh! When did you unhook
this? (Her bra.) Nice work!"
96,Joey," All right, it won’t go down any further. It’s stuck."
97,Ross," Ugh. Well, we’re just gonna have to jump. (Joey looks at him.) Yeah.
Now, we’re gonna have to make sure to land to the right of that patch of ice, okay?
Not hit the dumpster on the other side and uh, and try to avoid that-that weird brownish
red stuff in the middle. So, when you get down there…you go up to the
roof and you let me in."
98,Joey, Oh whoa-whoa wait a minute! I have to do it?!
99,Ross," Yeah! Oh yeah, you’ll be fine! It-it’ll be uh, just like bungy
jumping. Y’know? But instead of bouncing back up you-you won’t."
100,Joey, What if I smack my head on the concrete?
101,Ross," Well, I’m gonna lie to you Joey, it’s a possibility."
102,Joey," (looks at the ground and at Ross) I don’t know Ross! I-I tell you
what, let’s flip to see who does it, okay? You-you call it in the air, all right?"
103,Ross," Oh, all right. (Joey flips the coin.) Tails! (The coin bounces off of the
landing above them and falls to the ground.) Can you-can you see what it is?"
104,Joey, No.
105,Ross," Okay. Well, you be careful."
106,Joey," What? No! No Ross! No-no! Stop! I’m not jumping! Okay, look I have an
audition tomorrow and I can’t go if I break my leg."
107,Ross," Well I’m jumping! I have a son! Okay? He won’t have a father
if-if I die!"
108,Joey," Well all right so, it looks like we’re even!"
110,Phoebe," Okay. So, this wire is connected to this wire which plugs into here.
(She points at each as she says it.) Okay so, to get the beeping to stop all I have to
do… (She picks up a shoe and proceeds to pummel the smoke detector. She then gets up
and heads to bed, stops, quickly turns around, and is satisfied that the beeping has
stopped.) Well done, Pheebs. (She resumes her trek to bed, but is stopped at the entrance
to the hallway by the now steady and extremely loud tone emanating from the smoke
detector.) (Yelling.) What do you want from me?!!!!!!!"
112,Monica," Okay, here’s your milk. What do you want to talk about? (She sees
that Chandler has fallen asleep and slams the door loudly to wake him up.)"
113,Chandler, (startled) What? What? What?
114,Monica," Ohh! Ohhhh! Were you sleeping sweetie? I’m sorry. Here. (Hands the
mug of milk to him.)"
117,Rachel," Oh how can you possibly know? Look at this mess, Tag! I mean,
this is what I’m talking about! You have to be organized! You’ve got newspapers!
You’ve got magazines! You got—Ohh! (Finds a picture.) And who is this chippy? A
little young for you Tag, but whatever."
119,Rachel," Okay, very cute braces. Anyway y’know what, the point is
Tag, start looking because you are going to find those contracts on your desk. (She goes
into her office.)"
121,Rachel," In the afternoon. Mr. Zelner came into my office after lunch. He put
them on my desk, and then I put a Post-It on it (Looks down onto her desk and finds
the folder with the Post-It on it that contains the contracts she imagined she gave
Tag) that said, ""Must go out today."" So you just keep looking in there! All
right?"
125,Rachel," Puzzler. A bit of a puzzle. Why don’t you um, check the copy room,
maybe you left the contracts in there?"
127,Rachel," I don’t know Tag! How can your genitals make phone calls? Okay?
It’s not a perfect world! Just go please."
129,Rachel," Thank you. (He leaves and she proceeds to plant the folder in his bottom
drawer. She then picks up the phone and holds it to her breasts.) Hello? (Hangs up the
phone.) I still don’t get it."
131,Monica, Are you still awake?
132,Chandler, Yeah! You?
133,Monica," You do know that was me who just said that right? (He doesn’t
respond and she turns on the light, waking him.) Hey. As long as we’re both up…"
134,Chandler," (intrigued) Yeah? (Monica nods yes.) I hope you’re not thinking
about cleaning the living room."
136,Joey," Man, I’m starving! What the hell was I thinking at dinner?! ""Do
you want soup or salad?"" Both! Always order both!"
137,Ross," (looking in the window behind them) Y’know, y’know I’m
lookin’ and I don’t think anyone’s home here. I say we just break the
window, crawl through, and-and y’know explain later."
138,Joey, Yeah? Really? No one’s home?
139,Ross," I don’t think so. Hello? (Knocks on the glass, which angers the big,
large, angry dog behind the glass and causes them to jump to the other side of the
landing.) When you get in there… (Joey nods his disapproval.)"
141,Phoebe," Okay, this is where you and I part ways. (She drops the blanket into the
chute.) Noisy bitch!"
143,Monica, What?! What are you doing?!
144,Chandler, Do you know what just happened?
145,Monica, Yeah. We-we had sex and then we fell asleep.
146,Chandler, No. We were in the middle of sex…and you fell asleep.
147,Monica," Nooo! No, that’s not true. No, best time ever! Yeah, you rocked me
world! (She turns out the light to go back to sleep.)"
148,Chandler, (turning the light back on) Monica?
149,Monica, What?!
150,Chandler," I was giving you some of my best moves, and you missed it. So please
wake up so we can do it right!"
151,Monica," Okay. Okay, I’m ready. Come on big fella!"
152,Chandler, Okay.
153,Monica, Give me the good stuff.
154,Chandler," Yeah! (Monica falls asleep) No! No! No! Don’t fall asleep! Okay,
I am going to make you some coffee. (Monica doesn’t move as he gets out of bed and as
he’s heading for the door.) And I probably won’t spill coffee grounds all over
the kitchen floor."
155,Monica," Okay, I’m up! I’m up!"
157,Rachel," Hi! I got you some coffee. To, uh… (She looks for a place to set it
on his messy desk and he clears a spot for her to set it down.) …fair enough. So! Do
you got anything for me?"
159,Rachel," Oh my God! Did you check your entire desk! Did you check all the
drawers!"
161,Rachel," Well yeah, I wish that you would. (He opens the top drawer.) Well, no
it’s not in there! (Closes it.) How about that drawer? (She points to the bottom one
and he opens it. She doesn’t see the folder she planted and bends over to check.)"
163,Rachel," (thinks) Y’know, I don’t-I don’t know. Let me, let me
check. (As she heads for her office, she stops glances over her should at Tag, looks into
her office, and finds the folder on her desk.)"
165,Rachel, Can I see you in my office for a minute?
167,Rachel, You put these on my desk!
169,Rachel," Oh really? So you’re saying they just slid out of your
bottom drawer, crawled across the floor, then jumped on to my desk?! (I think Dogbert
should have a line here.)"
171,Rachel," (pause as she realizes her lame attempt to shift the blame has failed) I
am so hot for you right now."
173,Phoebe, Oh my God! How did you get back here?!
175,Phoebe," (scared) Fire alarm? (She opens the door to reveal a fireman holding the
blanket with the smoke detector.) Oh! Hi, officer—fireman, can-can I help you?"
177,Phoebe, That’s not mine.
179,Phoebe, How do you know?
181,Phoebe," Okay do you—Okay, do you have a search warrant? Because the last
time I checked this was still America!"
183,Phoebe," Fine! (She takes the blanket.) But please God; tell me how to stop them
from going off!"
185,Phoebe," There’s a reset button?! Ugh, thank you! Thank you! (He exits and
she goes to shut it off.) There’s a reset button! My God! Why didn’t I see that!
(She takes off the plastic cover and looks for the button.) Reset button, reset button,
where is there a reset button? (Finds it.) Oh here it is! (Picks it up off of the floor.)
Oh! (She presses it hard, but of course it would help if the button was still attached to
the detector. In frustration she presses it so hard it causes pain in her thumb.) Ohh,
God!"
187,Ross," Okay, do-do you have a good grip?"
188,Joey, Yeah!
189,Ross," Okay, I’m going to start climb down you now."
190,Joey, All right! Just hurry up!
191,Ross," Okay. Now-now-now should I climb down your front so we’re face to
face or-or should I climb down your back so we’re-we’re butt to face."
192,Joey, I think face to face.
193,Ross, I would say that.
194,Joey," Face to face, yeah!"
195,Ross," Okay, here I go."
196,Joey, All right. 
198,Joey, (grunting) Oh my… How much do you weigh Ross?!
199,Ross," I prefer not to answer that right now, I’m still carrying a little
holiday weight."
201,Joey," Y’know, when we talked about face to face, I don’t think we
thought it all the way through."
202,Ross, So what do you want me to do?
203,Joey," Well, just shimmy down me and drop!"
205,Ross, Hi.
206,Joey, Hi.
207,Ross, (looking down) M-maybe I should hang and you can climb down me.
208,Joey, (angrily) Yeah? Maybe we should talk about that for a little while!
209,Ross, It’s still looks pretty far!
210,Joey, It’s not that far! Just drop!
211,Ross, Do not rush me!!
213,Joey," Ross, you should know that my pants are startin’ to come down and
I’m not wearing any underwear!"
215,Ross," Oww!! My ankle! I really hurt my ankle! I think I twisted it when
I—Ooh, a quarter!"
218,Monica, That really was some of your best work.
219,Chandler," Hm-hmm, I told you! (Looks at the clock) I can’t believe that
I’ve only got two hours before I call in sick for work."
220,Monica, I have to be up in seven minutes.
221,Chandler," Well, you’re not gonna believe this, but if you have seven
minutes…"
222,Monica, Really?!
223,Chandler, Do you wanna?
224,Monica, Okay! You get the vacuum cleaner and I’ll get the furniture polish!
0,Joey, Hey.
1,Rachel, Hey.
2,Joey, What are you doing?
3,Rachel," Well, y’know I was thinking of moving the couch over here."
4,Joey, (laughs) Why would you want to do that?
5,Rachel, So that there will be a decent place for me to sit.
6,Joey," Rach, there is a decent place to…"
7,Rachel, And your lap does not count! Okay? Come on help me move this.
8,Joey, No. No. No.
9,Rachel, No?
10,Joey, No. Rosita does not move.
11,Rachel," I’m sorry, Rosita? As in…"
12,Joey, As in Rosita does not move.
13,Rachel," Joey, it’s just a chair! What’s the big deal?"
14,Joey," The big deal is that it is the exact equal distance from the bathroom to
the kitchen and it’s at the perfect angle so you don’t get any glare coming of
off Stevie."
15,Rachel, Stevie the TV?
16,Joey, (glaring at her) Is there a problem?
17,Rachel," No! (Joey sets his beer and bag of chips down and heads into his room.)
Oh what does he know! Come on Rosita, us chichas got to stick together! (She tries pulling
on the back of the chair, until the hinge breaks and the back falls off.) You bitch!"
20,Ross," Hey, y’know what’s weird? After you guys get married, when you
introduce me to people you’re gonna have to say, ""This is my brother-in-law
Ross."" Not, ""My friend Ross,"" ""brother-in-law Ross."" That’s
weird isn’t it?"
21,Chandler," Couldn’t I just say, ""This is Ross?"""
22,Ross," (disappointed) Sure, do whatever you want."
24,Monica," (entering, carrying a newspaper) Hey Ross! So, I was checking out the
uh, real estate section…"
25,Ross, Yeah?
26,Monica, Look at this. (Hands him the newspaper.)
27,Ross," Oh, it looks like mom and dad’s house. Oh, it even has a tree with a
broken limb out front and the uh, the window in the attic is…Oh my God!!"
28,Phoebe, What? What happened to the window in the attic?!
29,Monica, I can’t believe mom and dad are selling the house!
30,Ross, I can’t believe they-they didn’t even tell us!
31,Phoebe," I can’t believe I still don’t know what happened to the window
in the attic!"
33,Ross," (on phone) Uh, hello dad! Monica and I just saw the house in the paper!
(Listens) Yes we’re surprised! (Listens) Who did you leave a message with?"
34,Chandler, (knocking on the window while outside) Sorry! (Runs off.)
36,Rachel," Joey, Joey I am so sorry."
37,Joey," I told you not to move it! Rach, how would you feel if say, I wanted to
move you mom, and you said don’t, and I did it anyway and her head fell off?"
38,Rachel," Okay, come on—Joey, I’ll buy you a new one! All right?
We’ll go down to the store right now and we’ll-we’ll get you a new chair."
39,Joey, (slowly turning and glaring at her) She’s not even cold yet!
40,Rachel," But don’t you think Rosita would’ve wanted you to move on? I
mean y’know, she did always put…your comfort first."
41,Joey, That’s true.
43,Rachel, (grabbing her coat) Okay? You ready?
44,Joey," Yeah, I… (Shuts off the TV.) I don’t want Stevie to see her like
this."
46,Ross," I can’t believe we have to say goodbye to the house we grew up in.
Man, some-some stranger’s gonna be living in my room."
47,Monica," Well, after 15 years of mom and dad keeping it as a shrine to you,
it’s time the velvet ropes came down."
48,Ross, They kept your room for a while.
49,Monica," Oh please! Dad turned my room into a gym 20 minutes after I moved out! I
gotta say, a tanning bed and a stack of Victoria’s Secret catalogues, not a
gym!"
50,Ross," Come on, you know they love you."
51,Monica, As much as they love you?
52,Ross," I was their first born! They thought she was barren! It’s not my
fault."
53,Phoebe, (entering) Hey.
54,Ross, Hey.
55,Monica, Hey!
56,Phoebe," Ugh, I hate this year!"
57,Ross, What’s wrong with this year?
58,Phoebe," Well okay, it’s already February and I’ve only given two
massages and they were both the worst tippers in the world!"
59,Monica, That was me and Ross.
60,Phoebe, Oh that’s right!
61,Ross," Hey, y’know if you want to pick up some extra cash? Some friends of
mine made good money doing telemarketing."
62,Monica, Oh that’s a great idea. You’re really good on the phone.
63,Phoebe," Yeah and yeah, and it would probably be better than the last telephone
job I had. Y’know, I probably wouldn’t have to say spank as much. (Monica and
Ross are shocked.) "
64,Ross, What?
65,Phoebe," Oh yeah, like you never called!"
68,Phoebe," Okay, I can do that! Oh, by the way, I love my office."
70,Phoebe," Oh okay. Umm, all right. (Picks up the phone and starts reading from the
script.) Hi, this is Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies, can I speak to your supply
manager please?"
72,Phoebe," Umm, okay I would like to talk to you about your toner needs."
74,Phoebe," Oh okay, well I’m sorry to bother you. Bye-bye. (Hangs up the
phone.) Yeah you’re right, this is easy."
76,Phoebe," Oh well, all right…um, no offense, but you were kind of rude."
78,Phoebe, Oh.
80,Phoebe," No. (Pause) Oh wait yes! I do, I do have one question. What is toner?"
82,Chandler," Joey! Joe! (Sees that he’s not here and starts investigating. He
picks up the bag of chips.) Full bag. (He picks up the beer.) Beer’s still cold.
Something terrible must’ve happened here! (He decides it’s not that
important; sits down on Rosita, and the back falls off causing him to flip over.) Oh
no-no-no-no-no-no! (Runs over to Stevie.) Stevie, I was never here! (Runs out.)"
84,Ross, Dad?
86,Ross, (entering with Monica) Hey!
88,Ross," Dad, we-we can’t believe you’re selling the house."
90,Ross, (To Monica) Let’s grab our stuff and get the hell out of here.
92,Monica," Oh, that’s okay, I can’t wait to see everything again! All of
the memories…"
94,Monica, I used to love to play restaurant.
95,Ross," Yeah, not as much as you used to love to play uncooked batter eater."
96,Monica," Hey, it is unreasonable to expect a child to wait for a light
bulb to cook brownies! (She goes to the attic.)"
98,Ross," Wow! Great! (Finds a pack of cigarettes.) Wait, dad who-who’s
cigarettes are these?"
100,Ross," Cool! Dad! My report cards! Hey, check this out dad, (reading his grades)
Math, A. Science, A. History, A. Gym…(He puts it away and finds something else.)
Oooh, my rock polisher!"
102,Ross, It’s a clown kit! Clown kit!
104,Ross, What?
106,Ross, How are you ever going to sell this place?
108,Ross," Oh no. Dad! Dad! What…(He goes to open one of her boxes and it rips
apart.) Oh God…everything’s ruined! Dad, she’s gonna be crushed!"
110,Ross, No!
113,Phoebe," (on phone) Hi, this Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies, can I speak to
your supply manager please? (Listens) Earl, thanks. (Listens) Hi Earl, this is Phoebe from
Empire Office Supplies I’d like to talk to you about your toner needs. (She’s
reading from the script.)"
116,Phoebe," I’m hearing what you’re saying, but at our prices everyone
needs toner."
118,Phoebe, May I ask why?
120,Phoebe, I surely do!
123,Phoebe," (doesn’t have any luck) Umm, is-is that because you’re out of
toner?"
127,Phoebe," No-no wait-wait! I can’t just let you hang up! Just please talk to
me."
129,Phoebe," Yeah! Now, why do you want to kill yourself?"
131,Phoebe, Chandler?
133,Phoebe," No look, I-I’m sure that people know you exist!"
136,Chandler," My chair. Now, if anybody asks, your name is Rosita! (He runs out the
door, grabs the back of Rosita, and we can hear Joey and Rachel talking as they are coming
up the stairs. Neither of them have reached the landing yet.)"
137,Rachel, You will like it!
138,Joey, No I won’t.
140,Rachel, You don’t even know!
141,Joey," Because, I know what I like and what I don’t like! It’s not the
same thing!"
143,Rachel," Well look, if you don’t like this…(The audience’s
laughter at Chandler’s progress cuts out the rest of Rachel’s line.)"
144,Joey, I don’t know why you say that so soon.
146,Rachel," Come on Joey, I just bought you a new chair! The most expensive one in
the store! Hey, y’know what I was thinking? We could name her Francette."
147,Joey, Francette? What is she? A couch?
149,Joey, Poor thing. Cut down in her prime.
150,Rachel," Joey, the new chair will be here in an hour. Maybe we should actually
move Rosita out of here. Y’know, start the heeling process?"
151,Joey," Well, I guess you’re right. Maybe, maybe I’ll take her down to
the incinerator. It’s gonna be so said, and kinda cool. (He goes to remove the back,
but it doesn’t come off. So he sits down in it, puts his feet up, stands up, and
looks back at it.) She’s heeled!"
152,Rachel, That’s weird.
153,Joey," No it’s not weird, it’s a miracle!"
154,Rachel," It’s not a miracle Joey! I’m sure there’s some
explanation."
155,Joey," Oh there is! If you want something enough and your heart is pure, wondrous
things can happen!"
156,Rachel," Joey, I really don’t…"
157,Joey, (interrupting her) Can you tell me how this happened?
158,Rachel, Well no.
159,Joey, Miracle!
160,Rachel," No, y’know what? Maybe somebody came in here and fixed it! Or
something!"
161,Joey, Someone like an…angel?
162,Rachel," That’s right Joey, the chair angel came in and heeled your chair.
(She sits down in the chair.)"
163,Joey," (angrily) Get your non-believer ass outta my chair! (She gets up and heads
for her room.)"
166,Ross," Dad that won’t matter to her. Look, all my stuff is safe and dry and
all her is-is, is growing new stuff! See, this is exactly the kind of thing that makes her
think you guys love me more than you love her."
168,Ross," Well, can you blame her?"
170,Ross," Dad, dad I don’t want to hear about it."
172,Ross," Well, not right now. Okay look, Monica came here for some memories and
damnit, we’re gonna give her some! Okay, grab…grab some empty boxes. Okay?
We’ll-we’ll take stuff from mine and whatever we can pass off as hers
we’ll-we’ll put ‘em in their. "
174,Ross," Like uh y’know like this! This! (He picks up one of those art
projects that kids make in kindergarten and first grade.) She-she could’ve made this!"
176,Ross, Right? And this! (He picks up a trophy) She-she could’ve won this!
178,Ross," Sure! Ooh-ooh, what about this?"
182,Rachel," (grabbing a beer out of the chair’s fridge) I am so psyched I kept
this chair for myself!"
183,Joey," Yeah, me too. (He flips up his armrest in disgust.)"
184,Rachel," Hey, how’s…how’s the uh, miracle chair?"
185,Joey, Fine.
186,Rachel," Yeah? Wow! Y’know, that this thing has speakers in the headrest!"
187,Joey, No. Really?
188,Rachel, Yeah! You can hook it up to your TV and you get radio!
189,Joey, (quietly) My chair heels itself.
191,Phoebe," Earl, you’re not hearing me! All I’m saying is that
you’re not alone all right? Everybody hates the people they work with! (One of her
coworkers overhears that, and she mimes that she didn’t mean him.)"
193,Phoebe," Wait, what was that? That sounded like someone being nice to you."
195,Phoebe," All right so Earl, let’s just forget about the people at the
office, okay? There-there’s gotta be someone else in your life worth sticking around
for! What about-what about your family, your friends, or maybe your girlfriend?"
197,Phoebe," Oh sorry, boyfriend!"
199,Phoebe," No, whatever! Anything!"
201,Phoebe," Yeah, he’s gotta go."
203,Phoebe," No! I’m not finished yet! Don’t! Don’t you dare hang up
on me!!!"
206,Monica, Hey guys! Hey!
207,Ross, Hey.
208,Monica," Hey, I just whipped us up some Easy Bake treats, they should be
ready in about three days."
210,Ross," (overacting as well) Yeah! Yeah! (Laughs.) Oh, this will make a great
memory."
211,Monica," (wary) Okay. So, which boxes are mine?"
212,Ross," Well, these. These are yours right here. (Pointing to the boxes they just
created for her.)"
213,Monica," Okay. (Starting to go through them) Oh! A coloring book! (Holding it
up.)"
214,Ross," Yeah. Yeah, oh you loved that thing. You always had it with you. You never
went anywhere without-without that coloring book."
215,Monica," (looking through it) Really? Wow! It looks like I had some trouble
staying inside the lines."
216,Ross, Nu-uh! (Grabs it and examines it.)
217,Monica," (holding up a glove) Oh, an old glove?"
219,Monica," Wow! Look at this! (Picking up a shirt.) I can’t believe I even fit
into this shirt! (She holds it up and it reads Tyrannosaurus Ross.) (She turns it around
and looks at it.) Oh, this is yours. (Hands it to Ross.)"
220,Ross," Oh, I don’t know how that got in there."
221,Monica," (holding up a small cowboy hat) This isn’t mine. (Sets it down and
looks at the rest of the boxes.) Hey, this isn’t, this isn’t my stuff! Ugh,
Ross! (Grabs and holds up a doll.) These are your boxes! Where are my boxes?"
222,Ross," Umm, your boxes are umm…"
223,Monica, What?
224,Ross, Dad?
226,Monica, Just mine?
228,Monica," So why-why wasn’t Ross’s stuff ruined? (Pause) And if you say
the words medical marvel I’m going to Easy Bake your head!"
230,Monica," So wait, Ross’s stuff is fine, but I have no memories because you
wanted to keep the bottom two inches of your car away from water!!!"
232,Monica, I can’t believe this! (Storms out.)
236,Rachel, Hey Chandler!
237,Chandler, Hey!
238,Rachel," How would you like to sit in a chair that fully reclines, has a rolling
massage, and speakers in the head rest?"
239,Chandler," Yeah, I’d love to but I’ve tried that so many times they
won’t even let me in the store anymore."
240,Rachel," Well what if I told you, you can do it in my apartment?"
241,Chandler," (excitedly) Are you telling me that you bought the chair that is
making all other lounge systems obsolete? The chair that Sit magazine called the Chair of
the Year?"
242,Rachel," I just purchased the La-Z-Boy E-cliner 3000. (Which is an actual
product by the way, I’m not sure about the 3000 part.)"
243,Chandler, That’s awesome! That’s great! What made you do it?!
244,Rachel," Well, it’s a long story, but umm I broke Joey’s chair…"
245,Chandler, Whoa-whoa-whoa! You broke Joey’s chair?
246,Rachel, Yeah.
247,Chandler," I thought I broke Joey’s chair! That’s why I replaced
it with mine!"
248,Rachel, Ohhhhh. That’s how it got fixed!
249,Chandler," Well, what did you think, that-that elves came in and fixed it?"
250,Rachel, Noo! (Laughs) Angels.
251,Chandler," I’m gettin’ my chair back! (Heads for Joey and
Rachel’s.)"
252,Rachel, What? Wh-hey!
254,Joey," Well, it looks like it wasn’t heeled after all! Yeah! So, I guess
this chair is mine now! (Sits down in it and groans.)"
255,Chandler, Joey you broke my chair!!
256,Joey, Your chair?!
257,Rachel," Yeah, he thought he broke your chair so he switched the chairs!"
258,Joey," So, there was no miracle?!"
259,Rachel," No Joe, no miracle."
260,Joey," (sarcastic) Oh no this is devastating! My faith is shaken. I’m so
glad I have the new chair to get my through this difficult time in my life."
261,Rachel," Uh-huh! Nice try, but you don’t get that chair anymore! All right?
That is my chair now! You can sit on my lap! (Joey starts to get up.) No I take that back!"
262,Chandler, I think I should get the chair!
264,Joey, How do you figure?
265,Chandler," Because you (Points to Joey) broke a chair and you (Points to
Rachel) broke a chair! The only one around here that hasn’t broke a chair, is me!"
266,Rachel, No-no-no! This chair’s not going anywhere.
267,Chandler," Well, where’s the logic in that?!"
268,Rachel," The logic is, that there are two of us and we are both strong enough to
break a chair in half!"
269,Chandler, So Joey breaks my chair and I get nothing!
271,Joey, That’s right!
272,Chandler, What are you guys? Like a gang or something?!
274,Joey, Yeah! We are!
276,Rachel, We’re the Cobras!
278,Phoebe," (to Marge) Excuse me! Can you tell me where I can find Earl? He’s
the supply manager around here."
281,Phoebe, (goes over to his desk) Earl! I’m Phoebe.
283,Phoebe," Umm, look it, you-you can’t kill yourself."
285,Phoebe, No-no I can’t! I can’t let you do it!
287,Phoebe, Because it was fate that made me call you today!
289,Phoebe," No! Think about it okay? This isn’t even my regular job!
Okay? And my first day on the job, you’re my first call! And-and somebody else
might’ve hung up on you, but I wouldn’t do that because I know about this stuff.
My mom killed herself."
291,Phoebe, Yes.
293,Phoebe," I’m not gonna give you tips! Look don’t you see that
this-this…this all came together so that I could stop you from doing this."
295,Phoebe," No, it’s fate!"
297,Phoebe," Oh. Well umm, okay here’s a weird thing. My mother was also a
supply manager."
299,Phoebe," Oh my God! So was she! And! Get this, okay? Your-your name is Earl,
right? Her name was Pearl, P-Earl."
301,Phoebe," Sure! (Thinks.) Umm, where are you from?"
303,Phoebe," Oh my God! So was she! Oh, I’ve got-I’ve got goose bumps. (She
holds out her arm.)"
305,Phoebe," Well, y’know I’m wearing layers and it’s warm."
307,Phoebe," But if—no look, okay. These jerks might not care about you, but the
universe does! And that says a lot!"
309,Phoebe," Y’know, I don’t-I don’t think it’s you. This is a
freaky place. (To All) Hey! Guys! (Everyone looks up.) (To Earl) Oh no, it’s you."
312,Monica," Oh, this terrible! Everything is destroyed! Look at this. (She
picks up some kind of furry thing.) It obviously meant enough for me to save it, and I
don’t even know what it is! Ohh, it’s still soft. (She rubs it against her
cheek.) What do you think this is?"
313,Ross, All right. I think it was a mouse.
316,Monica," How do you think I am?! You’ve wrecked all my childhood memories.
You love Ross more than me. And I just rubbed a dead mouse on my face!"
319,Monica, (opening it) What’s this?
321,Monica, (shocked) What?!
322,Ross, (even more shocked) What?!!!
324,Monica," Wait, you’re giving me your Porsche, you’re kidding me
right?!"
325,Ross," Well w-w-w-w-wait, w-wait, wait, wait a minute! I mean a couple of stupid
boxes get wet and she gets a Porsche?!"
327,Monica, All right!
328,Ross," Well, what about me?! I’m a medical marvel!!"
331,Joey, Oh yeah.
332,Rachel, Ahhhh….
333,Joey, Ahhh…… (To Rachel) Eh?
334,Rachel, Uh-huh.
335,Monica, (entering) Hey guys!
336,Rachel, Hey!
337,Joey, Hey!
338,Monica, Do you guys know what happened to Chandler’s barca lounger?
339,Rachel," Oh yeah, Joey broke it. Had to get rid of it."
340,Monica," Are you kidding?! I get a Porsche and the barca lounger’s
gone?! This is the best day ever! (Runs out.)"
0,Ross, Happy birthday!!!
1,Monica, Happy birthday!!!
4,Monica, It’s your birthday!
6,Chandler, (To Monica) She’s not as pretty as she was when she was 29.
8,Joey, They do!
9,Phoebe, Rachel! Come on out! Monica made breakfast!
10,Monica, Chocolate-chip pancakes!
12,Ross, We’ve got presents!
14,Rachel, Good ones?
15,Monica, They all came from the list you handed out to us two weeks ago.
16,Rachel," Well, can I keep the presents and still be 29?"
17,Joey," Come on Rach! Look, turning thirty is not that big a deal."
18,Ross, Oh really. Is that how you felt when you turned thirty?
20,Joey," (screaming) Why God?!! Why?!! We had a deal!! Let the others grow old! Not
me!! (He buries his head in Phoebe’s lap for comfort.)"
22,Rachel," Y’know, I’m still 29 in Guam."
23,Ross," Hey, 30 is not that old! Do you know how old the Earth is?"
24,Rachel," Late thirties? Oh come on you guys! Is it just me? Am I overreacting to
this?"
25,Chandler," No Rach, it’s not just you. My thirtieth birthday certainly
wasn’t that much fun."
27,Joey," (screaming) And now Chandler! We’re all gettin’ so old! (Looking
up) Why are you doing this to us?! (Turns away crying.)"
30,Monica," Rach, you’re in a great place in your life. Come on, you’ve
got a great job! Good friends…"
31,Joey," Yeah, you’re roommate is a soap opera star."
32,Rachel," Look, y’know I know my life’s going pretty well, but I look
around and I just see so many people who’ve accomplished so many other goals by the
time they’re thirty."
33,Phoebe," Yeah, but you shouldn’t compare yourself to me."
36,Rachel, There you go!
38,Phoebe," I did it! One mile on a hippity-hop! That’s it!! That’s
everything I wanted to do before I was thirty. Oh, except I wanted to patch things up with
my sister. But oh well. Yay!! (They all cheer again.) And-and girls this thing is a
Godsend if you know what I mean. (Rachel and Monica look intrigued and as they all head
into Central Perk, Rachel picks up the hippity-hop that Phoebe left behind.)"
40,Rachel," Thirty. Ugh, I mean thirty! Monica, do you remember mean, old Mrs.
Kreeger in the fifth grade? She was thirty!"
42,Rachel, Nothing. I don’t want to do anything.
43,Monica," Well, doing nothing on your thirtieth is better than doing something
stupid, like Ross."
44,Ross," Hey! That was a practical purchase! I needed that car for transportation!
Okay? I-I have a child!"
46,Ross," How hot do I look in this, huh?!"
47,Chandler," Ross, a sports car? Wouldn’t it have been cheaper to just stuff a
sock down there?"
48,Ross," That’s not what this is about okay? I-I am a sports car enthusiast. I
have always been into cars."
49,Joey," Hey, what’s the horsepower on this thing?"
50,Ross," (giddy) I don’t know, but-but look how shiny!"
51,Monica, I can’t believe you bought this.
52,Rachel," Really! God Ross, what were you thinking? (To Phoebe, quietly) I know
it’s really shallow, but a part of me wants him again."
53,Phoebe," Oh, well get in line missy. (To Ross) So, can I have a ride stud?"
54,Ross, Hop in. (Phoebe hops in.) Get ready for the smoothest ride of your life. 
56,Ross, Damnit! (Shuts the car off.)
57,Phoebe," (getting out) Okay, who’s next?"
59,Rachel," Y’know what? I am going to do something today. I’m not just
gonna sit around like some old lady. I’m gonna get something pierced. Like my uh,
like my nose or my tongue or something."
60,Phoebe, Really?! ‘Cause y’know that hurts.
61,Rachel," So what?! Y’know what? The way I see it—(Phoebe pulls out a
hair from the back of her head)—Ow! Son of a bitch!!"
63,Rachel," (glares at him) Get out, get out of my apartment. "
64,Monica," All right Rach, for what it’s worth, I think that you’re doing
great. I mean y’know let’s face it, no one handles this well."
65,Phoebe, Least of all you.
67,Monica, Weren’t you asked to leave sonny?
69,Chandler," (To Joey) Would you put that back on?! Monica’s gonna be here any
minute!"
70,Joey, But it hurt’s my Joey’s Apple.
71,Chandler," (frustrated) Okay, for the last time. It’s not named for each
individual man."
74,Chandler," Oh well, not as lovely as you. I mean, I can’t believe that you
would have a thirty-year-old daughter! (To Mr. Geller) And you! I can’t believe that
you would have a tux that’s thirty years old! (Puts his hand on Mr. Geller’s
shoulder.)"
76,Chandler, Ohh! (He quickly removes his hand and looks at it.)
77,Rachel, (entering) Hey! Everybody hide! Hide! I saw her! She’s coming!
78,Chandler," Okay! Okay! Everybody down! Everybody down! (Rachel turns off the
lights and everyone crouches. As everyone crouches, a ripping noise erupts from the
assemblage.)"
81,Chandler," (getting up to investigate) Okay, everybody stay here. I will find out
what’s going on."
83,Monica, Heyyy!! You got the door open!! (Giggles.)
84,Chandler, Hey-hey are you drunk?
85,Monica," Nooo! (Giggles) Okay. (She tries to pull herself up by Rachel and
Joey’s doorknob, but the door opens and she almost falls into the their apartment.
She manages to catch herself.) Whoa! (Stands up, unsteadily) Okay. See I was, I was a
little nervous about turning (whispering) thirty. (Giggles.) So the bus boys took me out
for some drinks. (Pause) I wanna puke on you later!"
86,Chandler," Okay, here is the thing. We have thrown a very formal surprise
party for you in there! All of your friends are in there and your parents!"
87,Monica, Noo!!!
88,Chandler, Yes!
89,Monica, Noo!!
90,Chandler, Yes!!
91,Monica, Oh no! My parents have never seen me drunk! (Pause) That they know of.
92,Chandler," Okay, here’s the thing. We’re gonna get you some coffee and
they will never know that you’re drunk."
93,Monica, Really?! You promise?
94,Chandler," Yeah, I’ll take care of it."
95,Monica, Okay. I love you so much. (Kisses him.)
96,Chandler, (laughing) Okay we have to do something about your breath.
97,Monica, What about your breath?! (Breathes on him.)
98,Chandler," That’s still yours. Okay, now remember it’s a surprise
party. So, when you go in, act surprised."
99,Monica, Okay. I can do that.
100,Chandler, Okay.
106,Ross," Okay, forward. Forward—Stop! (The car moves an inch and Ross runs to
the back of the car.) Okay, back—Stop! (The car barely moves and Ross runs back to
the front.) Okay, forward—Stop! Stop! Stop!"
107,Monica," Ross, just forget about it. This guy’s got you totally wedged in."
110,Joey, Well actually…
111,Ross," No-no-no! It’s mine! It’s-it’s mine. (The woman walks
away.)"
112,Joey," Dude, you soooo need this car."
113,Phoebe," (running up) Okay. Okay, here’s what we’re gonna do. Okay,
I’m gonna break into this mini-van and put it in neutral. You guys push it forward so
Ross can drive out of his spot. Okay? All right, here we go. (She opens her coat and
reveals that thing car thieves use to break into cars as Ross jumps in behind the wheel.
She inserts the device, unlocks the door, opens it, and the alarm goes off.) Haul ass!!!!
(Runs off.)"
116,Phoebe," Happy thirtieth birthday! Here! (Hands her the hippity-hop.) It’s
for the child in you, and the woman. Happy thirtieth!"
118,Phoebe, Because it’s our thirtieth birthday.
120,Phoebe, Wait! (Knocks on the door and Ursula opens it.)
122,Phoebe, Yeah. What?!
124,Phoebe, Nu-uh!
126,Phoebe, You have your birth certificate?
128,Phoebe, Our mom.
130,Phoebe, Do you have my birth certificate?
132,Phoebe," (reading the certificate) Oh my God! Oh my God, we are 31."
134,Phoebe, I just lost a whole year of my life.
136,Phoebe, Your middle name is Pamela?
138,Phoebe," Well, I never knew mine. Do you remember what it is?"
140,Phoebe, That’s my first name.
143,Chandler," Okay before we start the celebration, Monica has to go put on her
party dress."
144,Monica, Yay!
145,Chandler," See? (Does his laugh.) Here we go. (Starts walking her to their room,
and has to pass in front of Mr. Geller who’s sitting at the table and Mrs. Geller
who’s standing next to him.)"
149,Monica, (sees someone) Paul!
150,Chandler, (correcting her) Phil.
151,Monica, Phil!
152,Chandler," Now, there is a dress laid out on your bed. (Monica stumbles on the
steps.) Okay, (catches her) you’re doing great. You’re doing great. You’re
doing fine."
154,Phoebe," Hey, what’s going on?"
155,Chandler, Monica’s a little drunk.
156,Phoebe, Yay! I love drunk Monica!
157,Monica, Awwwww… (Giggles.)
158,Chandler," (To Monica) Go change! (To Phoebe) She doesn’t want her parents
to know she’s drunk."
159,Phoebe," Ohh! All right! All right. Here’s what we’ll do, I’ll get
twice as drunk as Monica and then no one’s will even notice her."
161,Rachel, What’s-what’s going on? Phil’s really pissed!
162,Chandler, Monica’s wasted.
163,Ross, Maybe that will liven up this party.
164,Chandler," (To Rachel) Okay, will you just go help her change please!"
165,Rachel," Okay, but taking care of a drunk, naked woman seems like a job for Joey."
166,Joey," Yep. (Starts for Monica’s room, but Chandler stops him.)"
169,Rachel, Ahh!
171,Rachel, (opening it) A scooter! (She’s not happy.)
172,Ross, (to Tag) Stick to the list. Always stick to the list.
173,Rachel," No! No-no, I love it. Thank you. (Kisses him.) "
174,Chandler," Okay, open ours next. Open ours next!"
175,Rachel, Okay.
176,Joey," Now that you’re a couple, we don’t get two presents from you
guys?"
177,Chandler," For my last birthday you gave me a hug! (To Rachel) Okay, read
the card! Read the card!"
178,Rachel," Okay. (Opens the card and reads it.) Happy birthday Grandma! It’s
better to be over the hill (starting to cry) then buried under it. (Breaks down as
everyone glares at them.) All our love Monica and Chandler. (Crying) That’s funny,
yeah!"
179,Chandler, No-no-no-no! That was the joke!
180,Rachel," (crying) No, I know! I get it! It’s funny!"
181,Chandler," No, because you’re not a grandmother!"
182,Rachel," No I know, because to be a grandmother you have to be married and have
children and I don’t have any of those things. That’s why it’s so funny.
(Runs into her room crying.)"
183,Monica, All you had to do was buy the card!
185,Ross," Hey! Look who’s back! It’s the birthday girl! How’s the
birthday girl feeling?"
186,Rachel," Well, I feel fine, but I think you’re bumming out the rest of the
kids."
187,Ross," What? (Glances over and sees the faces of the rest of the group, then goes
and sits down.)"
188,Rachel," Okay! Y’know what? I realized it was stupid to get upset about not
having a husband and kids. All I really needed was a plan. See I wanna have three
kids…"
189,Phoebe," Oh let me guess, and you wanna have them all at the same time and you
wanna have them for your brother."
190,Rachel," As I was saying… I should probably have the first of the three kids
by the time I’m 35 which gives me five years. I love this plan! I wanna marry this
plan!"
191,Phoebe," If you could do that, I’d marry the hippity-hop."
192,Rachel," So, if I wanna have my kid when I’m 35, I don’t have to get
pregnant until I’m 34. Which gives Prada four years to start making maternity
clothes! Oh wait, but I do want to be married for a year before I get pregnant…"
193,Monica," Really! That long?! (Chandler slowly turns and looks at her.) (To
Chandler) Look all you want, it’s happening!"
194,Rachel," No, so I don’t have to get married until I’m 33! That’s
three years, that’s three whole years—Oh, wait a minute though. I’ll need a
year and a half to plan the wedding, and I’d like to know the guy for a year, year
and a half before we get engaged… Which means I need to meet the guy by the time
I’m thirty."
195,Ross," Which is fine! Because you just turned—(Removes two candles
from the cake)—twenty-eight!"
196,Rachel," No! Ross, no! It is not fine! Eh-eh-according to my plan I should
already be with the guy I wanna marry!"
198,Joey, Will you quit hoggin’ it!
201,Rachel," (To Chandler) I’m telling you it’s like watching Bambi learn
how to walk."
202,Ross," (To Monica) You’re drunk! Mom and dad are gonna be maaaaadd! Maybe
I’m a little drunk."
204,Chandler," (to a waiter) Oh that’s great! Right there! Can we get some of
that over here please? (The waiter comes over) There we go."
205,Joey," (to the waiter) Hey! Are those crab cakes? (The waiter nods) Did I not
tell ya to come straight to me when more crab cakes were ready?"
206,Chandler, (To Monica) How are you feeling?
207,Monica," You are so handsome! I wanna make love to you right here, right
now! (Growls and pulls him into a kiss.)"
208,Ross, I really wish that you wouldn’t.
209,Chandler," (To Monica) Now all you have to do is just get through a little bit
more, okay? Then we can put you in bed, okay? Just smile and don’t talk to anyone."
210,Phoebe," (clinking two glasses together) Speech! Speech! Let’s hear from the
birthday girl! Huh?"
211,Chandler, Pheebs!!
212,Phoebe," Don’t you see? Everyone’s looking at me! The plan’s
working! I didn’t even have to take off my top yet!"
214,Ross, Come on!
219,Chandler, I think it’s necessary. (Backs away anyhow.)
220,Monica, I-I-I wanna thank you all for coming. My family and my friends…
221,Phoebe, (screaming) Wooo!! Hoo!!
222,Monica," I really like to say that I’m-um… (Pause) Y’know what
I’d really like to say? I’m drunk!! (Mrs. Geller pulls the camera down.)
That’s right mom and dad your little Harmonica is hammered!! (Ross grabs the camera
out of his dad’s hands.) And guess what! I’ve been drunk before! And I’ve
smoked a cigarette! And I got a box of Ding-Dongs hidden in my underwear drawer!
It’s all okay. It’s okay because I turned thirty today. And, and I can do
anything I want! Because I am a grown up. (Falls over sideways with Ross filming
the fall.)"
223,Phoebe," (To Joey) Okay quick, help me get this off! (Motions to her top.)"
224,Joey, Yeah!!
227,Phoebe, I lost a whole year! I can’t believe it! This is so unfair!
228,Joey," Oh, I don’t know Pheebs. It’ll be okay."
229,Phoebe," Will it? Will it?! I mean, how would you feel if you found out you were
31?"
230,Joey, That’s not gonna happen. No. (Looks up) Because we have a new deal!
231,Phoebe," Plus, it totally ruined my schedule! I…I haven’t done any of
the things I wanted to do by the time I was 31!"
232,Joey, Like what?
233,Phoebe," Like okay I-I-I, I haven’t met any Portuguese people! I, I
haven’t had the perfect kiss! And I haven’t been to sniper’s school!"
234,Monica," Phoebe, y’know why don’t we just go upstairs and have some
birthday cake?"
235,Phoebe," No, I just feel like being by myself for a while. All right? I’ll
see you guys later. Thanks. (Gets up and exits.)"
236,Rachel," Hey. (After she leaves.) Oh, poor Pheebs."
237,Joey," Hey, y’know what you guys? I think I’m gonna go walk her home.
(Gets up and runs out.) "
238,Monica, Oh man!
239,Chandler, What?
240,Monica, He’s gonna eat the cake!
242,Joey," Pheebs! Wait up! (She stops.) Listen uh, close your eyes. (She does so and
Joey passionately kisses her.) Maybe that’s one thing you can cross off your list."
243,Phoebe, Oh yeah.
245,Joey," Oh, and plus I’m 1/16th Portuguese."
246,Phoebe, Oh! (Phoebe walks away smiling.)
248,Ross," Okay, is everybody clear? We’re gonna pick it up…and move it.
Now all we need is teamwork, okay? We’re gonna lift the car…and slide it
out. Lift and slide!"
249,Rachel," Ross, I really don’t think…"
250,Ross, (interrupting her) Lift!! And slide!
251,Chandler," Okay, here we go."
252,Ross," All right everyone, lift! (They and try to lift the car, of course it
doesn’t raise up) And slide!! (Everyone leans over, but the car still does not move.)"
254,Rachel," Hey Joey, can I…"
255,Joey," Oh, come on Rach! My turn just started!"
256,Rachel," Actually, I just wanna talk to Tag."
257,Joey," Oh. Okay. Hey, can I ride this outside?"
258,Rachel," Whatever! Okay, I’m not your mother."
259,Joey, Okay! (Runs off downstairs.)
260,Rachel, Not in the street!!
261,Joey, Yes!
262,Rachel, (to Tag) Hi.
264,Rachel, Hey.
266,Rachel," Yeah, I’m doing okay. I’m um…let’s talk."
268,Rachel, Umm…
270,Rachel," Ohh Tag, umm…you’re such a great guy and we have sooo much fun
together but I don’t-I don’t…"
272,Rachel," Well said. And a uh good example of the fun I was referring to uhh, but
I just think I’m past the point where I think I can y’know, just have fun."
274,Rachel," Yeah, it is! But you’re just a kid! I mean you’re 25!"
276,Rachel," Oh God! Y’know what I wish? I wish you were six years older. Well
actually, if I’m wishin’ for stuff, I actually wish I was six years younger."
278,Rachel," Yeah, I’m sorry. (They hug.)"
280,Chandler, Hey! How’d it go?
281,Rachel," Oh, if I only want two kids, can I keep him for another year?"
282,Phoebe, You did the right thing.
283,Joey," (entering, limping, and holding his arm) I don’t like this anymore.
(He sits down with them in pain.)"
284,Chandler," Well, here we are, just a bunch of thirty year olds."
285,Ross," God, do you realize in ten years we’re gonna be 40?"
286,Joey," (crying) Why God?! Why are you doing this to us?! (He buries his head in
Ross’s shoulder.)"
288,Ross, Yes! My baby’s finally free! 
289,Joey, All-all right! (They run and jump in the car.) Start it up! Let’s go!
290,Ross, (starting it) Woohoo!
293,Ross, You wanna buy a car?
294,Joey, No.
0,Monica," I’m glad you’re here, we have a couple of things to ask you
about the wedding ceremony."
1,Rachel, (starting to cry) Ohh…
2,Ross, What’s the matter? You okay?
3,Rachel," Yeah, it’s just y’know…"
4,Chandler, (To Ross) Monica said wedding.
5,Monica," Uh, so anyway, we thought one of you could read something during the
ceremony."
6,Rachel, Oh! I would love to read a poem.
7,Chandler, Do you think you could get through a poem?
8,Rachel, (crying) It’ll be a short one.
9,Monica," Okay, so Ross will be doing the reading."
10,Rachel, Ohhh…
11,Ross," Okay. Yeah, I guess, I guess I could do that too."
12,Chandler, Too?
13,Ross," Yeah, I kind of uh, have something else planned for you guys."
14,Monica, Do you mind telling us what it is?
15,Ross," Sorry, I’m kinda keeping this one on the Q.T."
16,Chandler," Well, whatever it is, I hope it involves winking. (Winks in a spy-type
manner.)"
17,Joey," (entering, excited) Hey!"
19,Joey," So I just talked to one of the DOOL writers today, and…"
20,Monica, What is DOOL?
21,Joey," Days Of Our Lives. Anyway, you’re not gonna believe it! My
character is coming out of his coma!!"
23,Chandler, That’s great!
24,Joey," And-and-and not only that, I’m gettin’ a new brain!!"
25,Chandler," So great things are happening at work and in your personal
life!"
26,Rachel," Wait, what do you mean you’re getting a new brain?"
27,Joey," Oh well, they’re killing off one of the characters on the show, and
when she dies her brain is being transplanted into my body."
28,Ross, What? A brain transplant?!
29,Joey," (seriously) Yes, it’s a highly controversial procedure."
30,Ross, It’s ridiculous!
31,Joey," Well, I think it’s ridiculous that you haven’t had sex in three
and a half months."
32,Ross," (to Monica and Rachel) It’s winter, they are fewer people on the
street. (Rachel and Monica smile and nod, knowingly.)"
33,Monica, Who are they killing off?
34,Joey," Uh Cecilia Monroe, she plays Jessica Lockhart."
36,Monica, She’s my favorite character on DOOL.
37,Joey, Nice.
38,Rachel," She is so good at throwing drinks in people’s faces, I mean I
don’t think I’ve ever seen her finish a beverage."
39,Monica, And the way she slaps all the time!
40,Rachel, Oh!
41,Monica," Wouldn’t you love to do it just once?! (Raises her hand towards
Chandler.)"
42,Chandler, Don’t do it.
43,Rachel," Cecilia Monroe man, what a great actress."
44,Joey," Oh, tell me about it. And she’s been on the show forever, it’s
gonna be really hard to fill her shoes."
45,Ross," Yeah-yeah, help me out here, when you come out of the ""brain
transplant,"" you are going to be her?"
46,Joey," Yes, but in Drake Remoray’s body. (Ross laughs unbelievably.) Why is
this so hard for you to get? I thought you were a scientist!"
49,Phoebe," (Clears Throat) Rach, so, that guy there. Straight or gay?"
50,Rachel," (They both look behind them.) Well, I'd have to say gay."
51,Phoebe, Yeah? Why?
52,Rachel, Well mainly because he's kissing that other guy.
53,Phoebe," Oh no not that guy there. That guy right there. (Pointing to an
attractive man sitting at a table behind them.)"
54,Rachel, Oh yeah he's too cute to be straight.
55,Phoebe," (A woman with large breasts walks in the door) Ohh knockers will help us
figure it out. (She walks by and he checks her out.)"
56,Rachel," All right, straight, and not subtle. (The man gets up and leaves.)"
57,Phoebe," Ohh, he left his cell phone."
58,Rachel," Oh, well, we can hand it to Gunther and he'll put it in lost and found."
59,Phoebe, Or we could use it to call China. See how those guys are doing.
60,Rachel," What if, um, if he calls his own cell phone to find out who found it and
I answer and we start talking and we fell in love. I mean wouldn't that be a great story?
Kind of like a fairy tale for the digital age."
61,Phoebe," Yeah… That does sound great. I'm going to get the phone. (They both
get up.)"
62,Rachel, What? Wait! Why…why do you get the story?
63,Phoebe, I don't know. I haven't been out on a date in so long.
64,Rachel," Phoebe, you had a date three days ago."
65,Phoebe," That wasn’t a date! That was, that was just friends getting
together…(quietly) having sex."
66,Rachel," Okay. Okay, see? I get the phone."
67,Phoebe, No way! No way! You just broke with Tag a week ago.
68,Rachel," Yeah! (Breaking up) And until now, I didn’t think I’d love
again."
69,Phoebe, Nice try.
70,Rachel, Oh hey-hey wait! How do we fairly decide who gets the phone?
71,Phoebe, I don’t know. 
73,Rachel," Well umm, maybe we could uhh… (Grabs the phone) Ah-ha! Too slow!! "
75,Phoebe, Ah-ha! Too cocky!
85,Joey," That was a great scene! And-and-and that slap looks so real! How do you do
that?"
88,Joey," Oh anyway, I just wanted to say how wonderful I think you are."
90,Joey, Say what?
92,Joey," No. No, I’m Joey Tribbiani; we did a scene together yesterday.
I-I’m the guy in the coma!"
94,Joey," An-an-anyway I-I just wanted to say that since I’m getting your brain
when you leave the show, I was wondering if there was any tips you can give me…"
96,Joey, (quickly) I don’t know. Why? Did you hear something?
98,Joey," Oh uh, one of the writers."
100,Joey, Umm…
102,Joey, Okay.
104,Joey," Ms. Monroe… (She slaps him) Oh there you go. (She storms off, leaving
Joey standing next to Dina. They share a nod at the ferocity of the slap they just
received.)"
106,Rachel," No Phoebe! You cannot get the phone that way; that’s not fair! Okay
look, I have an idea. Why don’t we, why don’t we see what kind of number he has
on his speed dial, and then from that we can tell who has more in common with him. And
then whoever does gets the phone."
107,Phoebe," Or, we can decide by whose ever name is closer to the word phone."
108,Rachel, I don’t think so.
109,Phoebe," (handing Rachel the phone) Fine all right, but I’d bet you’d
be singing another tune if we were fighting over a ratchet."
110,Rachel," (checking the speed dial) All right, first name on the speed dial is
mom."
111,Phoebe," Ohh, I lost my mom to suicide."
112,Rachel," Okay no way, you cannot use that to get the cute guy and the last
blueberry muffin."
113,Phoebe, Did I use that already today? I’m sorry.
114,Rachel," Yes okay. (Checking the speed dial again.) Well now see this isn’t
telling us anything. (Reading the speed dial) Joe. Carlos. Peter. Ooh! Peter Luger! T
hat’s a steak house!"
115,Phoebe," Okay, a meat eater. Fine, that’s one for you."
116,Rachel," (looking at the speed dial) Oh, I win! He’s got Barney’s
on his speed dial."
117,Phoebe," So you don’t know that’s Barney’s the store! That
can be y’know his friend’s house, or a bar. Who has Barney’s the
store on their speed dial?"
118,Rachel, (showing Phoebe her phone) His new girlfriend!
120,Monica, What is that?
121,Chandler, I think it’s the dying cat parade.
122,Monica, It sounds like it’s coming from across the street.
123,Chandler, (turning around and looking) Oh my God!
124,Monica, What?
125,Chandler," Y’know that thing that Ross was gonna do at our wedding?! He was
hanging out with me yesterday and he turned to me and said, ""You’re half
Scottish right?"""
126,Monica, Nooo!!
127,Chandler, Yes!!
131,Monica," No, there is no way! It can not be Ross! (She looks through the
window and sees Ross practicing and fumbling around with the pipes.) Unbelievable! Why
is your family Scottish?!"
132,Chandler, Why is your family Ross?!
133,Monica," He cannot play at our wedding! I mean everyone will leave! I mean come
on, that is just noise! It’s not even a song!"
134,Chandler," If you listen very carefully, I think its Celebration by Cool
and the Gang."
136,Rachel, Hi Pheebs!
137,Phoebe, Hi!
138,Rachel, How are ya?
139,Phoebe, Good.
140,Rachel," Umm Pheebs, remember when we were in the coffee house we decided that I
was going to keep the uh, the cute guy’s cell phone?"
141,Phoebe, Yeah.
142,Rachel," And remember how I said I was going to keep it in my purse so that if it
rang I could just pick it up?"
143,Phoebe, Yeah!
144,Rachel, And do you remember going into my purse and stealing the phone?!
145,Phoebe," Ooh, now you lost me."
146,Rachel, You stole the phone!
147,Phoebe, No I didn’t!
148,Rachel," No? So you’re saying that if I called it, it wouldn’t ring?"
149,Phoebe, No.
150,Rachel," Umm, okay. But while you dial, let me show you the features of my new
ringing handbag. (Rachel dials her phone and Phoebe’s bag starts to ring.) Oh, it
does work! (Rachel grabs the phone and takes it out of Phoebe’s handbag.)"
151,Rachel, Phoebe!
152,Phoebe, That is a different phone.
153,Rachel," Oh is it?! (She answers the cute guy’s phone.) Uhh, hello? (On her
phone) Yes hi, is Rachel there? (On the other phone) Yes she is, just one moment please.
(To Phoebe, holding out both phones.) It’s for me!"
154,Phoebe, That is damning evidence.
156,Rachel," Oh my God! I bet that’s him. My digital fairy tale is about to
begin. I wonder how I should be? Should I be uh (In a sexy voice) Hello? Or should I be
(Happily) Hi! It’s Rach… (Phoebe knocks the phone out of Rachel’s hand,
catches it, and answers it.) Would you stop doing that?!"
157,Phoebe," (on phone) Hello? (Listens) Yes, I’m the one who found your phone."
158,Rachel, Phoebe! You can’t do th…
159,Phoebe," (To Rachel) Shhh! I’m on a call! (On phone) Umm well yeah, you can
pick it up tonight, say 830? At-at my apartment. It’s umm, it’s umm 5 Morton
Street, Apartment 14, umm and then maybe y’know after we can grab a bite to eat or
whatever. (Listens) Okay, well okay I’ll see you then. (Listens) Bye. (Hangs up.)"
160,Rachel, You do know that I will be here when he comes over.
161,Phoebe, Oh? And how will you know what time to come over?
162,Rachel, You just said it!
163,Phoebe," Oh. Okay, well I-I was kinda hoping that I would just…be alone
y’know to think about my mom and her suicide."
164,Rachel, Oh Phoebe!
165,Phoebe, What?! That’s the first time today!
166,Rachel, Ohh! (Exits.)
168,Joey, So you like the nachos uh? Myself I’m partial to…
170,Joey, See you in 2003. (She walks away.)
172,Joey," I’m so sorry. Look, if it was up to me you would never leave the
show."
174,Joey," No I mean it! I can’t believe they would do this to you! And to your
fans! I mean they are going to be devastated! Heart broken! They love you so much!"
176,Joey, Joey.
180,Joey," Uh yeah-ye-ye-ye-ye-ye—l-l-l-l-l-look the-the-the only reason that I,
that I came up to you before was because well, I’m really nervous about-about being
you. Y’know if you can help me capture the essence of the character. Y’know?
Help me keep Jessica alive. Please?"
182,Joey, Oh that’s great! Oh thank you so much!
184,Joey," Hey! Now, I’ve been watching some tapes, how’s this? (In a
British accent.) ""Jessica Lockhart will never step foot in this place again!
Ever!!"""
186,Joey, Yeah.
188,Joey," (shocked) I can do an English accent?! That baby’s going on my
resume!"
190,Chandler," Well, I feel like a snack!"
191,Monica, Do you want some shortbread? Eh that’s Scottish like you are.
192,Chandler," Oh no thanks. I don’t like any thing from my Scottish
heritage."
193,Ross, What?!
194,Chandler," Well it’s just my entire family was run out of Scotland
by…Vikings. Anyway, lots of bad memories. (Makes a few unintelligible noises.)"
195,Ross," Oh well, it sounds to me like your family is ready to uh, rediscover its
Scottish roots."
196,Monica," No! No-no they’re not. They’re still very angry! But
y’know Chandler is also half-Swedish. You know what the Swedish people are famous
for? Sitting down and being quiet."
197,Ross, Well yeah-yeah the Scottish history is so much more…
198,Monica, (interrupting) You can not play bagpipes at the wedding!!
199,Ross, How did you know about that?!
200,Chandler, We heard you play all the way from your apartment!
201,Ross, Were you the ones called the cops?!
202,Chandler," That’s not really important right now. What is important is;
while we appreciate the gesture, we just don’t feel bagpipes are appropriate for our
wedding."
203,Ross, Why not?
204,Chandler, Because we hate them.
205,Ross, Come on that’s not fair! I mean you haven’t even heard me play!
206,Chandler, We have heard you play.
207,Ross," No, you’ve heard my practice. Okay? Just-just give me a chance to
perform for you and then decide whatever you want. And I’m not going to tell you what
song I’m gonna play either. But uh, let’s just say when it’s over I’ll
bet there will be a we bit o’ celebration."
210,Joey," Okay! (He scurries out the set door and re-enters, extremely impressed)
All right!"
212,Joey," Okay. Okay. (He goes out and comes back in, glaring at everything.)"
214,Joey," Oh well—Hey-hey! Maybe, maybe uh, maybe this is a good thing.
Y’know? It’ll-it’ll give you a chance to shake things up, play different
characters. You’re so talented."
216,Joey," Hey that’s not true! Look at uh, look at Angela Lansb—Angelina
Jolie!"
218,Joey, Like-like what?
220,Joey, (impressed) Wow!
222,Joey," Oh hey come on, don’t-don’t-don’t do this! Umm, look
let-let me tell you something, okay? Now when I watch you do a scene, I’m thinking,
""Boy, she-she is a great actress!"" (She’s not buying it.) Uh but-but, I am
also thinking, ""She is hot!"""
224,Joey," You own the room. (She smiles and stares longingly into his eyes.) We
should probably get-get uh…"
226,Joey," Yeah-yeah, I noticed that! Is that ‘cause she’s so passionate?"
228,Joey, Yeah! Okay. (He puts his hands on her face and they kiss.)
232,Rachel, Hey! Hey!
237,Phoebe, Whoa! Why do you get to answer the door?
238,Rachel, Well why shouldn’t I?!
239,Phoebe, Because it’s my apartment!
240,Rachel," Well, then I get to give him the cell phone."
241,Phoebe," Okay. All right. (Hands her the phone.) Good luck explaining all the
calls to China."
244,Phoebe, (To Rachel) Wow! How long were we arguing for?
245,Rachel, (laughs) You’re not the man who left the cell phone.
247,Rachel, Is-is he coming? (Looks hopefully out the door.)
249,Phoebe," Could you-could you umm, give us one second?"
251,Rachel, We’ll be right back sir.
254,Phoebe, Wh-what do we do?
255,Rachel, I don’t know!
256,Phoebe," Can you believe this? (Rachel exhales in amazement.) We were waiting for
a hot guy and then an even hotter one shows up!"
257,Rachel, I know! (Realizes what Phoebe said.) What?!
258,Phoebe," Hmm, they just don’t make ‘em like that anymore!"
259,Rachel," (turning and looking at Tom again) No-no they do but, you just have to
wait."
260,Phoebe," Rachel, listen—I mean, if you let me have him then I will really
owe you one."
261,Rachel," (fake disappointment) All right. All right Phoebe I will let you have
him, but you owe me; you owe me big!"
262,Phoebe, Yeah! You’re such a great friend!
263,Rachel, Ohh…
265,Phoebe, Oh that’d be me. Sir. (Hands him the cell phone.) After you.
267,Phoebe, (whispering) Nice!
270,Joey," Actually I rent the whole place and, I just got what you meant. Thank you."
272,Rachel, Hi.
273,Joey, Hey!
275,Rachel," Oh my God! Oh my God!! Ohh, Jessica Lockhart!! In my apartment!! I am
such a huge fan! I am such a huge fan!"
277,Rachel, (screaming) MONICA!!!! MONICA!!!! (Runs to Monica’s.)
278,Joey," That uh, that is my roommate Rachel."
280,Joey, (shrugs) Sure. Yep.
281,Monica," (entering with Rachel) Oh my God! It’s true!! Oh my God you are so
amazing! Oh my God, can I just ask you to do me oh, just one favor?"
283,Monica," Would you slap me? Would you slap me right here in the face?! (Points to
her cheek.)"
285,Rachel," God. You seem really, really nice."
286,Joey," Okay, bye-bye."
287,Rachel, I mean n-not-not fake at all like most famous people.
288,Joey," All right, here we go. (He grabs them and starts to pull them out of the
apartment.)"
289,Rachel, Okay.
290,Monica," (breaks away) Oh wait, just one more thing! One more minute! (To
Cecilia) Umm, you’re a stupid bitch."
292,Rachel, You are so beautiful.
293,Monica, Nice to meet you! My God you’re great!
294,Joey," Thanks for stopping by. See ya! (Throws them out and closes the door.) (To
Cecilia) I-I am so sorry. I…"
296,Joey, (notices something in the mail that Rachel brought in) Oh my God!
298,Joey, They sent me today’s script! They never send the script!
300,Joey," Well no, I’m just in a coma. This must mean I have lines! (Realizes
what that means.) Oh…"
302,Joey," (flipping to the last page) Ew, you get thrown from a horse into an
electric fence."
304,Joey," Yeah well, I’m guessing after this she’s not going to be crazy
about electricity either."
306,Ross, …now remember you have to imagine me in a kilt.
307,Rachel," (giggles) (To Ross) I can imagine you in a short plaid skirt and knee
socks."
308,Ross, (To Rachel) Do you wanna start telling secrets?
309,Rachel, No!
310,Ross," (stands up) Now umm, remember I’m still learning."
312,Ross," One, two, three, four!"
314,Ross, You know the song! Sing along!
316,Ross, So?
323,Joey, (as Jessica) I don’t think so.
328,Joey, Oh noo…
330,Joey, Thanks!
332,Joey, Great! Hey! All right! Well-well what is it?!
334,Joey, The airport?
336,Joey," Ohh. Wow! Well how-how, how will you be gone?"
338,Joey, That’s a really long time.
340,Joey," Well I tell ya, I should probably buy a place in the city first.
(Realizes.) And I just got what you meant again—That is—I tell ya, that is a
tricky one!"
342,Joey, Good luck.
347,Ross, You know the song! Sing along!
348,Phoebe, Eeee!!! Eee!! Eee!! 
0,Ross, Hi.
1,Rachel, Hi! Hi Ben!
3,Ross," Hi, we have a little bathroom emergency."
4,Rachel," Oh, yeah go ahead."
6,Ross," Uh, before we do uh, are any of Joey’s special romance magazines in
there?"
7,Rachel, No. No.
8,Ross, (to Ben) Okay! All clear!
10,Rachel," Ben, its Rachel! (He closes the door.) But whatever."
11,Ross, (to Ben) Everything okay in there?
13,Rachel," Awww, just like his daddy."
14,Ross," Hey listen can you do me a big favor? The dean’s office just called
and said there was an urgent meeting. Can you watch Ben for like an hour?"
15,Rachel, What-what about Monica?
16,Ross," Oh, she isn’t home."
17,Rachel," (nervous) So it would just be, me alone?"
18,Ross," Well, Ben would be there."
19,Rachel, Huh umm…
20,Ross, What’s the matter?
21,Rachel," Well that—y’know it’s just uh, I’ve never done that
before. Me and him alone."
22,Ross," Rach, he’s not an ex-con."
23,Rachel," Okay. Okay. Okay. Uh, what do I, what do I do with him?"
24,Ross, I don’t know! Just-just talk to him-entertain him and keep him alive.
25,Rachel, Okay.
26,Ross," Okay. (Ben enters) Ben? Come here. All right, I’m gonna leave you
here with Aunt Rachel for about an hour. Okay? Are you gonna be okay?"
27,Rachel, Yeah I think so.
28,Ross, (To Rachel) I wasn’t talking to you.
30,Ross," Okay, I’ll see you soon buddy. (He hugs and kisses him.) Be back in
an hour."
32,Rachel," Bye. (Ross exits.) Ahhh… (Silence) So this is fun, huh?"
34,Rachel," Okay. Uh, want something-want something to drink?"
36,Rachel, Uh great! How do you feel about Diet Coke?
38,Rachel," Okay. Well that’s pretty much all that we have—Oh! Oh! Have
you ever had a virgin margarita? (Holds up a bottle of margarita mix.)"
40,Rachel, Water it is.
43,Monica, What about the second minister we meet with? I kinda liked him.
44,Chandler, You mean the spitter?
45,Monica, Come on! It wasn’t that bad!
46,Chandler, Easy for you to say; you’ll be wearing a veil.
47,Monica," All right, what about the third guy?"
48,Chandler, You mean the guy who kept staring at your chest?
49,Monica, Can you blame him?
50,Chandler," Sorry, I just don’t like the idea of when I say, ""I
do,"" he’s thinking, ""Yeah, I’d do her too!"""
51,Monica, Well then we still have a problem.
52,Chandler, Yeah!
53,Phoebe, (returning with Joey) With what?
54,Monica," Well, we’re trying to find someone to perform our wedding and
they’re all either boring or annoying or y’know, can’t stop staring at the
ladies. (Points to her chest.)"
56,Phoebe, Oo! You should have one of us do it!
57,Monica," Phoebe, we’re getting married, married; not sixth grade
married."
58,Phoebe," No! No! It’s-it’s uh a real thing! Anyone can get ordained on
the Internet and perform like weddings and stuff!"
59,Monica, Are you serious?
60,Phoebe, Yes! A friend of mine did it and it’s totally legal!
61,Joey, I call it!!
62,Phoebe, What?! No! It was my idea!
63,Chandler, Guys thank you very much but neither of you is marrying us.
64,Joey, Does calling it not mean anything anymore?!
65,Chandler," We are going to have a legitimate member of the clergy! And when I say
legitimate I mean, gay and in control of his saliva!"
67,Rachel," Ben y’know when uh, when you were a baby, you and I used to hang
out all the time. ‘Cause I was, I was your daddy’s girlfriend."
69,Rachel," No, I’m not."
71,Rachel," Hey! We were not on a—Okay. That’s fine! Fine.
Y’know what Ben? One day when you are a lot older I am going to tell you that entire
story over a pitcher of real margaritas, okay?"
73,Rachel," (checks her watch) Fifty-two minutes. (Pause) So no-no brothers and
sisters, huh? That must be nice. You don’t have to share stuff."
75,Rachel," Oh, you’re one of those. But y’know what? I have two
sisters of my own and we just-just tortured each other."
77,Rachel," Well y’know, we would umm, repeat everything the other said, or uh,
we’d jump out of closets to scare each other, or switch the sugar for the salt so
they’d put salt on their cereal."
79,Rachel, Yeah? You like that one?
81,Rachel," I’m funny? Oh thank God! Well hey, I’ve got a ton of these!
Umm, oh hear—Do you want a good one? Here’s a good one. Umm, you uh, you take a
quarter, take a quarter and, and you blacken the edge. Right? (Does so.) And then you say
to person, I bet you can’t roll this quarter from your forehead to your chin without
it leaving your face. And then when they do it, they’re left with a big black pencil
line right down the center of their face."
83,Rachel," Yeah, I-I-I-I’m funny Ben, but I’m not stupid. Okay?"
85,Joey," So, did you uh, find anyone to marry you guys yet?"
86,Chandler," No, but Horny for Monica Minister called, wanting to know if we were
still together."
87,Monica, We’re never gonna find anybody.
88,Joey, Well then let me do it!
89,Chandler, Joe…
90,Joey," No-no-no! Look, I’ve been thinking about it. I’m an actor right?
So I won’t get nervous talking in front of people."
91,Monica, Joey look it’s really sweet…
92,Joey," No-no-no-no look no! I won’t spit, and I won’t stare at
Monica’s breasts! Y’know? Everyone knows I’m an ass man!"
93,Monica, That is true.
94,Joey," Yeah and the most important thing is that it won’t be some like,
stranger up there who barely knows you. It’ll be me! And I swear I’ll do a
really good job. Plus, y’know I love you guys and-and it would really mean a lot to
me."
95,Chandler," (To Monica) Y’know, we haven’t found anybody else."
96,Monica, It might be kinda cool.
97,Joey, So I can do it?
98,Chandler, Yeah you can do it.
99,Joey," All right!!! Okay!! All right! Okay-okay, I gotta get started on my
speech! Oh, wait a minute, Internet ministers can still have sex right?"
100,Chandler, Yeah.
101,Joey, Okay.
103,Monica," Hey Pheebs, how’s it going?"
104,Phoebe," Oh, I have a headache. A horrible headache!"
105,Monica," Oh, I’m sorry. Can I get you something?"
106,Phoebe," Oh my God, you’ve got to stop chattering!"
107,Monica," Here, take a couple of these. (She gets up to grab a couple of pills.)"
108,Phoebe, What is it?
109,Monica, It’s Hexadrin.
110,Phoebe," Oh no, I don’t believe in Western medicine. No, if you just apply
pressure to these points right here. (She’s pinching the bit of skin between her
right thumb and forefinger with her left hand.) Then your hand starts to hurt and you
still have a headache, so thanks. (Takes the pills.)"
111,Monica," Okay, while we’re waiting for these pills to kick in, I’m
gonna sit you down on the couch. Come on. (Phoebe gets up and goes with her.) Get some
nice soft pillows under your head, I’m gonna turn the TV on and you can watch
whatever you want. And I’m—Sit down—(She sits down on the couch)—gonna
make you some tea. And then, I’m gonna rub your feet."
112,Phoebe, Oh.
113,Joey," Oh! My head! Oh! (He’s sitting on the chair, lies back, and puts his
feet up for Monica to rub.) Oh!"
115,Rachel, Coming. 
117,Ross, I have a bone to pick with you.
118,Rachel, Uh-oh.
119,Ross, Yes! Ben learned a little trick.
120,Rachel," Oh yeah? Did he pull the old… (She is waving her hand up and down
her face. She’s thinking about the pencil mark.)"
121,Ross," That’s right! That’s right! Saran Wrap on the toilet seat
so the pee goes everywhere!"
122,Rachel, Oh that.
123,Ross," Yeah that! You know I hate practical jokes! They’re mean and
they’re stupid and-and I don’t want my son learning them!"
124,Rachel," Oh, come on! Saran Wrap on the toilet seat, you don’t think
that’s just a little funny?!"
125,Ross," I was barefoot. Now tell me, the toilet thing is the only thing you taught
him right?"
126,Rachel, (looking at his mark) Yes.
128,Phoebe," It’s amazing! My headache is completely gone! What are those pills
called?"
129,Monica, Hexadrin. (She gets the box out of her purse.)
130,Phoebe," Oh, I love you Hexadrin! (She kisses the box.) Oh look! It comes with a
story! (She pulls out the instructions and side affects paper.)"
131,Monica," No Phoebe, those are like the side affects and stuff."
132,Phoebe, Say what?
133,Monica," Y’know, the possible side affects."
134,Phoebe," Oh my God! (Starts reading them.) Dizziness, nervousness, drowsiness,
facial swelling, nausea, headache—Headache. Vomiting, stomach bleeding, liver damage!
Now okay, I don’t recall any of this coming up when you gave me these little death
capsules! Oh I’m sorry, extra strength death capsules!"
135,Monica," Phoebe, relax none of that stuff ever happens! They just put it on there
for legal reasons!"
136,Phoebe, Why?
137,Monica, In case it happens.
138,Joey, (entering) Hey!
139,Chandler, Hey!
140,Joey," Say hello to Reverend Joey Tribbiani! (Holds up the piece of paper bearing
the proof of his ordination.)"
141,Chandler, Hey!
142,Monica, You did it! You got ordained?!
143,Joey," Yeah, I just got off the Internet! Man, there is a lot of porn out there!"
144,Chandler, Our minister…
145,Phoebe, I have liver damage. Ow! Oh! (She grabs the left side of her torso.)
146,Monica," Phoebe, your liver is right here. (She points to the right side of her
torso.)"
147,Phoebe," Okay, then I must be disoriented."
148,Joey," Anyway, I started working on what I’m going to say for the ceremony,
do you wanna hear it?"
149,Chandler, Okay.
150,Monica, Yeah!
151,Joey," Now-now, listen this is just a first draft so… (Starts to read the
piece of paper he brought.) ""We are gathered here today on this joyous occasion to
celebrate the special love that Monica and Chandler share."" (Monica and Chandler like
it so far.) Eh? (He continues reading.) ""It is a love based on giving and receiving.
As well as having and sharing. And the love that they give and have is shared and
received. And through this having and giving and sharing and receiving."" (Phoebe nods
her approval.) ""We too can share and love and have and receive."""
152,Chandler, (To Monica) Should we call the spitter?
156,Rachel, Hi!
158,Rachel," Well y’know I was just in the neighborhood and I passed by your
building and I thought to myself, ""What’s up with Carol and sweet, little
Ben?"""
160,Rachel, Okay.
162,Rachel," I’d love that. I would loooove… (Carol goes to make the coffee
and she sits down.) So uh, so where is sweet little Ben? I would love to have a little..."
164,Rachel," I found him! (To Ben) Very funny, come here! (She sits down on the
coffee table and Ben walks up.) That is exactly why I’ve come here to talk to you
okay?"
166,Rachel," Yes oh—(To Ben)—Do I want sugar in my coffee? (Ben nods no.)
No, just some milk would be good Carol. Thanks. (To Ben) Okay, do you remember all that
stuff I taught you yesterday?"
168,Rachel, Don’t do that.
170,Rachel," Seriously, your dad doesn’t like pranks."
172,Rachel, Oh damnit!
174,Rachel, No! Don’t say that! Don’t say that!
176,Rachel, No don’t! Go back to repeating!
178,Rachel, Oh crap!
181,Phoebe, I feel like my face is swelling. (To Monica) Is my face swelling?
182,Monica," Phoebe, your face is fine! Come on, none of this stuff is going to
happen to you! Stop being such a baby!"
183,Phoebe," Oh, interesting you should call me that! Now that I may never have one!
(Holds up the warning label.)"
184,Joey," Okay you guys, I got a little more written. Are you ready?"
185,Chandler, Yeah. O-okay.
186,Joey," (reading) ""When I think of the love that these two givers and
receivers share, I can not help but envy the lifetime ahead of having and loving and
giving and…"" And then I can’t think of a good word for right here. (He
points to the stop on the paper where he left off.)"
187,Monica, How about receiving?
188,Joey, Yes!
189,Chandler," See Joe, not that that’s not grrreat! But, one of the cool things
about having somebody we know perform the ceremony is that it can be about us!
Y’know, it can be more personal. You can tell stories about us!"
190,Joey," Ooh, like the time you and I went to Atlantic City and I made you laugh so
hard you threw up your whole steak?! Remember?"
191,Chandler," No, not us… (Motions Joey and him.) Us! (Motions Monica and him.)"
192,Monica," I gotcha. Sorry. (To Monica) So, did you ever make him throw up a whole
anything?"
193,Phoebe," Did you ever feed him a poison capsule that made him bleed from the
eyes?"
194,Monica, It doesn’t say that!
195,Phoebe, Oh! Suddenly somebody knows all about the side affects!
196,Chandler," See Joe, we want you to tell stories but y’know, romantic
stories. Nice stories."
197,Joey," Oh. Okay. Ooh! Ooh! Okay, maybe I’ll talk about London! Y’know
when you two hooked up! Only, only I won’t say hooked up. I’ll say, ""Began
their beautiful journey…"""
198,Monica, There you go!
199,Joey," ""…by doin’ it."""
200,Chandler, Joe?
201,Joey," Okay. All right. Umm, so uh, so how did it happen? Did your eyes meet
across the room? And then the next thing y’know you’re in the bathtub together
and she’s feeding you strawberries?"
202,Chandler, Isn’t that what happened with you and the bride’s maid?
203,Joey, Yeah!! I call that London style.
204,Monica," No that is not what happened with us. Well, I was umm, I was really sad
that night because this guy that I was Ross’s mom."
205,Joey, Oh.
206,Monica," And then Chandler was, was really sweet and he consoled me. And well we
drank too much…"
207,Joey, Yeah baby!
208,Chandler," And I was a perfect gentleman and I walked her to her hotel room and
said goodnight."
209,Joey, Oh.
210,Chandler, But then later that night…
211,Joey, Yeah baby!
213,Chandler, (answering the door) Hey!
214,Monica," (standing outside) Cute PJ’s! You’re really livin’ it up
here in London huh?"
215,Chandler," Well I was… I was exactly expecting company after…(He looks
at his watch.) 915."
216,Monica, (entering) Is Joey here?
217,Chandler," Well, last time I saw him he was heading out the door with the
bride’s maid and a bucket of strawberries. So uh, you’re not still upset about
what that guy told ya are ya?"
218,Monica, Wouldn’t you be?
219,Chandler," Well, look it’s been a really emotional time y’know, and
you’ve had a lot to drink. And you’ve just got to let that go okay? I
mean you were the most beautiful in the room tonight!"
220,Monica, Really?
221,Chandler," You kidding? You’re the most beautiful woman in most rooms…
(She jumps up and kisses him.) (Breaking the kiss.) Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What’s going
on? You and I just made out! You and I are making out?"
222,Monica," Well, not anymore."
223,Chandler, But we don’t do that.
224,Monica," I know, I just thought it would be fun."
225,Chandler, How drunk are you?
226,Monica," Drunk enough to know that I want to do this. Not so drunk that you
should feel guilty about taking advantage."
227,Chandler, (thinks) That’s the perfect amount!
228,Monica, Okay!
230,Monica, (breaking the kiss) Y’know what’s weird?
231,Chandler, What?
232,Monica, This doesn’t feel weird!
233,Chandler, I know.
234,Monica, You’re a really good kisser.
235,Chandler," Well, I have kissed over four women. (They kiss again.) Do you wanna
get under the covers?"
236,Monica, Hm-hmm!
237,Chandler, Okay!
239,Monica, Wow! You are really fast!
240,Chandler, It bodes well for me that speed impresses you.
241,Monica, We’re gonna see each other naked.
242,Chandler, Yep!
243,Monica, Do you wanna do it at the same time?
244,Chandler, Count of three?
245,Monica, One!
246,Chandler, Two!
247,Monica, Two!
249,Chandler," Well I think it’s safe to say that our friendship is effectively
ruined."
250,Monica," Eh, we weren’t that close anyway!"
251,Chandler, Eh!
253,Chandler," Joey! Joey! Joey! J-J-Joey-Joey-J-Joey! (Monica hides under the covers
as Joey enters. Remember?)"
254,Joey, Hey!
255,Chandler," Hey Joe! I was just watching a movie-e-e… (Notices that the TV is
turned off.)"
256,Joey," Oh, dude I’m so sorry!"
257,Chandler, No! No! No!
258,Joey," Hey no-no-no-no! It’s cool! It’s cool! I-I’ll only be a
second, I’m still with my bride’s maid, I just—Where are those condoms you
brought?"
259,Chandler, They’re in my bag over there. (Points.)
260,Joey," Ah. (Joey walks to Chandler’s bag by getting as far away from
Chandler’s bed as possible.)"
261,Chandler," Uh, could you leave me one?"
262,Joey, (pause) For just you?
263,Chandler, Yeah.
264,Joey," Hey listen, why don’t you come downstairs with me? There’s some
really nice girls down there."
265,Chandler, No I-I-I’m fine.
266,Joey," All right, here you go buddy. (He tosses him one.) Go nuts. (Exits.)"
268,Joey," That’s what that was?! ‘Cause that other thing? I thought you
were on to something, but it did nothing for me."
269,Monica," Okay, can we change the topic? Because it’s really doing
nothing for me."
270,Joey," Oh… (To Chandler) Can you imagine if I hadn’t left you that last
one? You two might’ve never gotten together. Ooh-ooh! Could you imagine if I sent
that hooker up to the room like I was gonna?! It’s like it was in the stars!"
271,Phoebe," Yeah, it’s totally meant to be. (To Monica) Tell him who you
originally wanted to hook up with that night."
272,Monica, What?!
273,Chandler, What?
274,Phoebe, (To Joey) What?!
275,Chandler, Who did you originally want to hook up with?
276,Monica," Okay, fine but please don’t be upset! Okay? I was really
depressed okay? And really drunk! I just wanted something stupid and meaningless. I just
wanted…just sex. So, when I…went to your room that night…I was actually
looking…for Joey. (Joey smiles.)"
277,Joey, Yeah baby! (Chandler glares at him.) No baby!
280,Chandler," (To Monica) So you came to the room looking for Joey? Did you ever
in-intend on telling me about this?"
281,Monica, No because it-it didn’t seem important.
282,Chandler," Oh, it’s not important? It’s not important?! If it
wasn’t for a bride’s maid you’d be marrying him (Points to Joey) not me!"
283,Monica," Noo!! The point is that is was you that was there that night! It
is you that I am marrying! It is you that I feel in love with!"
284,Joey," And it is a love that is based on having and giving and receiv—(Shuts
up on Monica’s glare.)"
285,Chandler," I don’t believe it. The most romantic night of my life and
I’m runner up."
286,Monica," Chandler, please! Do you know how unbelievably glad I am that Joey was
not there that night?!"
287,Joey," Hey! (Monica turns and looks at him) Now I’m a man of the cloth, but
I still have feelings!"
288,Chandler," (To Joey) Look there is no way you’re doing this wedding now.
Okay?"
289,Joey," What?! That’s not fair! It’s not my fault! I was off with my
bride’s maid! And who’s to say I would’ve even said yes?! (To Monica) I
mean I would’ve said yes. Chandler look y-y-you are making way to big a deal out of
this, all right? Look, everything worked out okay!"
290,Chandler," Okay, it’s just weird! Okay? I don’t want to be standing
their saying my vows and then having the mental image of you and Monica! I-I-I need…I
don’t know what I need. I need a walk."
291,Monica," Wait Chandler come on, let’s—it’s not a big deal!"
292,Chandler," It is to me. You wanted to sleep with Batman, and instead you
had to settle for Robin. (Walks out and slams the door.)"
293,Joey, This is crazy.
294,Phoebe, I know! Robin is so gay!
296,Rachel, So now what have we agreed?
298,Rachel, And-and what else?
300,Rachel, Very good.
302,Ross, Rachel! What are you doing here?
303,Rachel, I’m just visiting my good friend Carol.
304,Ross, Your good friend?
305,Rachel, Yeah!
306,Ross, What’s her last name?
307,Rachel, Carol…Lesbian?
308,Ross," Nice. And by the way that uh, that line down my face?"
309,Rachel, What line?
310,Ross," Wh-wh-what line? The line that prompted a student in my last class
of the day to say uh, (In a college frat boy voice) ""Dude, don’t you ever was
your face?"""
311,Rachel," All right, I’m sorry. I’m sorry I didn’t tell you but you
were so mad already!"
312,Ross," Of course I was mad! I told you I-I hate this stuff! Okay? It-it’s
not funny!"
314,Ross, Hi.
316,Ross, Practical jokes.
318,Ross, You have a line down your face.
320,Rachel," Okay, maybe they are not funny to you…"
322,Rachel, Or Carol! But they’re funny to kids and who is it hurting?!
323,Ross," Uh, y’know what? I’ll tell you who it hurts! It hurts the kid
who has all his clothes stolen in gym class so he has to go to the principal’s office
wearing nothing but a catcher’s mitt!"
324,Rachel," That was you?! We heard about you in Junior High! Did you really
just shake your fist in the air and shout, ""I will be revenged?!"""
325,Ross," I will be! Listen, I don’t want you teaching my son that stuff
anymore. Okay?"
326,Rachel," Fine. Fine, but I’ll have you know that once I taught him that
stuff he called me Fun Aunt Rachel. And I loved being Fun Aunt Rachel but I’ll go
back to being Boring and Uncomfortable Aunt Rachel if that’s what you want!"
327,Ross," No that’s not what I want. Uh, I’m glad you guys were bonding
but I…"
328,Rachel," Look he doesn’t have any brothers or sisters, somebody’s gonna
have to teach him this stuff! And I haven’t taught him anything that a normal
6-year-old doesn’t know anyway!"
330,Rachel, I gotta go! (Runs out.)
332,Joey, Hey.
333,Chandler," Hey. Do you want this scone? (Holds up his plate) It came for me but
it would probably rather sleep with you!"
334,Joey," Chandler, come on nothing even happened!"
335,Chandler," Look Joe, I know you wanted to do the wedding…"
336,Joey," No-hey-no! If you don’t want me to do it, I except that. I don’t
care about that. I just…I don’t want you to be upset."
337,Chandler," How can I not be upset? Okay? I finally fall in love with this
fantastic woman and it turns out that she wanted you first!"
338,Joey," Yeah for like a half an hour one night! Chandler, she wants you for the
rest of her life! You’re so lucky! Look what I missed out on by not being there!
Although you know what? It could never have worked like you guys did, ‘cause you guys
are perfect for each other. Y’know, we look at you and-and we see you together and it
just…it-it fits. Y’know? And you just know it’s gonna last forever."
339,Chandler, That’s what you should say.
340,Joey, What?
341,Chandler, When you’re marrying us; that’s what you should say.
342,Joey, Really? I can do it?
343,Chandler, I’d love it if you would do it.
344,Joey, Hey! (They hug.)
345,Chandler, But those are the words! Those exact words!
346,Joey," Well I don’t know remember exactly but, it’s-it’s pretty
much about having and giving and sharing and receiving."
348,Ross, Hey!
349,Rachel, Hey!
350,Ross," Hey I’m sorry to do this to you again but uh, is there any way you
can look after Ben for a little bit? I-I’ve got this meeting at school. And-and he-he
asked for his uh, ‘Fun Aunt’ Rachel, so…"
351,Rachel," Ohhh! Well of course I will watch him! We have fun, don’t we Ben?
(He nods yes.)"
352,Ross," Okay, I’ll see you later pal."
354,Rachel," Ohh, okay. (Ross has a sign on his back that reads ‘Poop.’)
Wh—Ah-ha! (Ross stops and turns.) Wait a minute. Uh Ben, I can’t do it."
355,Ross, What?
356,Rachel," I can’t let him go out that way, he’s got a meeting. (To Ross)
You’ve got something here on your back."
357,Ross," What? (She takes the sign off and hands it to him.) That’s great.
That is great. (Crumples up the paper and throws it down in anger.) What did we just
finish talking about Ben?!"
358,Rachel, Oh I…
360,Ross," All right, that’s it! (He runs over to Ben, but he runs past him and
out the door.) Come—you—no! You are in big trouble young man!"
361,Rachel, No! Wait! Come on!
363,Ross," Wait! No! Ben, come here! I am not kidding!"
364,Rachel, No you guys… (She walks out into the hallway.)
365,Ross," I-I-am—(Suddenly Ross starts screaming and comes falling down the
stairs landing just in front of Rachel.)"
366,Rachel," EHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!! My God!!!!!!!!!!! Oh my God!!!!!!! (She runs over to
him and finds that it was a dummy and that she had been had.)"
368,Joey, Hey!
369,Monica, Hey-hey.
370,Joey, So are guys doing okay?
371,Chandler," Yeah, we talked and Monica made me see that I over reacted a little
bit and some things in life are more important."
372,Monica, Yeah baby! (Phoebe and Joey nod.)
373,Phoebe," I’m really glad you guys are okay but, I just keep thinking what
would happen if-if you two (Points to Monica and Joey) actually had hooked up."
375,Monica, Honey! Dinner’s ready!
378,Monica, Your favorite!
379,Joey," Ho-ho-ho, (pausing for a rest next to the fridge) fried stuff with cheese!"
380,Monica, Yep! And lot’s of it!
383,Monica," Okay, in we go."
388,Joey, Here you go.
389,Phoebe," (still reading the label) Oh my God! This is a six-hour pill! (Checks
her watch) That’s it! I’m out of the woods! Ohh! What a relief!"
390,Joey, Good for you!
391,Phoebe," Oh, it’s like huge weight has been lifted! ‘Cause look, (reads
the side affects) no hair loss, not a rash, no hives, I’m just so happy! Because no
shortness of breath, no temporary euphoria—Oh."
0,Monica," So the wedding caterer sent me this list of twelve appetizers and I have
to narrow it down to six."
1,Joey, Food? Uh-huh gimme! (She hands him the paper.)
2,Chandler," So did Monica tell you about this great band called the Swing Kings
that we’re trying to get to play at the wedding?"
3,Phoebe, Since when are you into swing music?
4,Chandler, Oh since forever! I used to go all over town listening to bands!
5,Monica, Chandler.
6,Chandler, Gap commercial. (To Monica) So did you book them? Did you call?
7,Monica, I will.
8,Chandler, Do you want me to call?
9,Monica," No, I’ll do it. You just stick to your job."
10,Phoebe, What is your job?
11,Chandler, Staying out of the way.
12,Joey," This is impossible Monica, why don’t you just pick all 15? (Hands
back the paper.)"
13,Monica, There were only twelve.
14,Joey," Oh yeah, I added three."
15,Monica, What are peanut butter fingers?!
16,Joey," Oh yeah… (He mimes sticking his fingers into a jar of peanut butter,
scooping some out, and eating it off his fingers.)"
19,Ross," (noticing a beautiful woman moving in down the street) Well hello!
She’s cute! Should we uh, go try to talk to her?"
20,Chandler," Sure! That’s one of the great things about being engaged.
I’m not nervous talking to pretty girls anymore."
22,Ross," Uh yeah! Let me, let me get that for you."
24,Ross," (exhales) I got it. (He lifts the box and grunts under the strain.)
(Calmly) So hi, I’m uh, I’m Ross and this is my friend Chandler. (He shyly
waves.)"
26,Ross," Kristen, hi. Are you uh, new to the area, ‘cause if you
are…I’d love to show you around sometime."
28,Ross, Ah.
30,Ross," Y’know actually it does have a very interesting history. Uh, this
street is the first street in the city to have an underground sewer system. (Kristen
crinkles her nose at that.) Before that sewage and waste would just flow right down the
street. Yeah, sometimes ankle deep! (He stops when he realizes what he’s talking
about.)"
31,Chandler, (To Ross) Smooth.
33,Ross," Umm, say you’re gonna be starving after all this moving. What do you
say I take you to dinner tonight?"
35,Ross, Yeah?
37,Ross," Great! Uh, let me take this up for you. (The box he’s holding.)"
39,Ross," Oh no-no, after you. (She grabs a chair and heads upstairs.) (When
she’s gone.) Oh my God! (He drops the box and Chandler can’t pick it up.)"
41,Phoebe, (wearing a veil) Am I crazy or does this totally go?!
43,Rachel, Oh my God! You look so beautiful!
44,Phoebe," (To Rachel) Thank you Rachel but, look at Monica!"
45,Monica," This is it. Yeah, this is the one. I can’t believe I found it!"
48,Monica," Well I’m Monica Geller, ball like a baby."
50,Monica, Have you found your dress yet?
52,Monica," No, I can’t afford this either. No. I-I-I’m, I’m just to
figure out which one I want then I’m gonna get it at Kleinman’s, this discount
place in Brooklyn, day after tomorrow they are having a huge sale."
54,Monica, Yeah! So-so when are you getting married?
56,Rachel, I do the same thing.
58,Rachel," I’m just kidding too. (Laughs) I’m getting married in
December. (Turns away not happy with herself.)"
60,Monica, Oh May 15th.
62,Monica, Yeah!
64,Monica, Jeffery.
66,Monica, The best man? Wow!
68,Monica," Oh, my fiancee wants the Swing Kings."
70,Phoebe," Ooh, is that spelled with a ‘C’ or a ‘K’? Oh my God!
It doesn’t matter; they’re both great!"
72,Rachel," Oh y’know what? Y’know what? Now that you know what you want
you should go to Kleinman’s and get it half off. This place is so overpriced."
74,Rachel," So, does this (The dress) come in another color or… (The store
owner walks away.)"
76,Joey," (checking her out) Hi! You uh, movin’ in or movin’ out?"
78,Joey," Oh uh, can I give you a hand?"
80,Joey, Boyfriend?
82,Joey, I’m Joey. (They shake hands.)
84,Joey," Oh wow, what a beautiful name! (Pause) What is it again?"
86,Joey, Got it! (He picks up a lamp.) So…
88,Joey," Yeah! Yeah! Right down there. (Points.) Hey listen; let me give you a
little tip. Do not take a nap on this stoop (Points to hers) or you can wake up with your
shoes gone."
90,Joey," Okay. Yeah. Listen would you uh, would you like to have dinner with me
tonight?"
92,Joey, Oh.
94,Joey," Sounds great! Okay all right, well where does this go? (The lamp he’s
holding.)"
96,Joey," Okay. Yeah. (She leaves and he goes to pick up a box marked books, but
decides to take the box marked pillows instead.) Yeah, I’ll grab this one. (He
follows her upstairs.)"
99,Rachel, (To Phoebe) So this is Brooklyn.
100,Monica," All right, listen up. There is usually only one dress in each size so
when they open those doors, fan out. Now, this is what you’re looking for! (Holds up
a picture of it.) Memorize it! When you locate the dress, blow on these. All right? (She
passes out whistles to them.) Three short blasts, when you hear it. Come running."
101,Rachel, Okay.
102,Phoebe, Got it.
103,Monica, All right.
106,Rachel, Oh they’re pushing! They’re pushing!!
107,Monica, (To Rachel) Hey! Don’t be a baby!
108,Rachel, Well I…
111,Phoebe, (coming back out) Hey! Rachel! Come on!!!!
113,Monica," No. No. Not it. Not it. Not it. (Checks another rack and another woman
tries to reach around her.) (To the woman) Don’t crowd me! (Finds it) This is it!
This is the dress! Oh my God, it’s perfect! (She takes it off of the rack and someone
has a hold of it on the other side of the rack and tugs on it.) I’m sorry, this
one’s taken! (The other woman tugs harder pulling Monica through the rack.) Whoa!"
114,Monica, Megan!
116,Monica, You came?!
118,Monica, This is my dress!
120,Monica, Yes it is! You saw me wearing it!
122,Monica," What? You freak! You wouldn’t even have known about this place if
it wasn’t for me!"
124,Monica, Maybe I do! I’m pretty feisty! (She blows the signal.)
126,Phoebe," (hearing the signal) I’m coming! I’m coming! (She takes off
towards the signal and almost knocks another woman over.)"
129,Phoebe," Okay! (Runs that way and hears another whistle blast.) Hey! (Heads the
other way and hears another blast.) What do I do?!! (She runs in the second direction and
finds that the whistling is coming from inside a rack. She moves the dresses out of the
way to find Rachel curled up in a fetal position frantically blowing on the whistle.) What
are you doing? (Rachel doesn’t stop.) Did you find the dress? (Rachel won’t stop
so Phoebe pinches her nose shut which causes her to spit the whistle out.)"
130,Phoebe, Did you find the dress?
131,Rachel," No! You gotta get me out of here Phoebe! These bargain shoppers are
crazy!"
132,Phoebe, I—We gotta get Monica. (She starts to leave.)
133,Rachel, No! You gotta hold my hand!!
134,Phoebe," Oh my God!! (She grabs Rachel’s hand and drags her towards Monica.)
Excuse me! Excuse me! (She’s knocking women and veils out of the way as she moves.) "
136,Monica, (handing Phoebe the dress) Go! Go! Go!
137,Rachel, (seeing who’s trapped) Hey…
138,Monica, NOW!!!!!!!! (Rachel runs off and Monica gets up to follow her.)
140,Chandler," So Ross, how was your date the other night? Did you tell her about the
magical ride that starts with the flush of every toilet?"
141,Ross," Laugh all you want but uh, she actually left me a message saying
she’d like to go out again."
142,Chandler, Huh.
143,Ross," Yeah in fact, I’m gonna go call her right now. And I’ll make
sure to tell her my friend Chandler says… (He mimics the shy reaction Chandler did.)"
144,Joey, (entering) Hey Chandler!
145,Chandler, Hey!
146,Joey," Listen, sorry I didn’t stop by last night but I had a date."
147,Chandler," Uh Joe, when it’s one o’clock in the morning and you
don’t come by? That’s okay!"
148,Joey," Well check it out, I was with this really hot girl who just moved in right
across the street!"
149,Chandler, Really? Right across the street?
150,Joey, Yeah!
151,Chandler, When’d you meet her?
152,Joey, Two days ago.
153,Chandler, Excellent! Y’know Ross met somebody too!
154,Joey, Oh yeah?
155,Ross, (returning) Hey.
156,Chandler, Hi! How’d it go?
157,Ross," Oh great! We’re going out again Saturday. But I just found she’s
also seeing some other guy."
158,Chandler," (sarcastically shocked) Really?! Joe? What would you do if you were in
Ross’s situation?"
159,Joey," Well, I sorta am. I mean yeah, I’m dating this girl who’s also
seeing another guy. But, I don’t know, I’m not to worried about it."
160,Ross," Well you shouldn’t be. Believe me I wouldn’t want to be the guy
who’s up against you. (Chandler laughs.) I mean that doofus is going to lose!"
161,Chandler," So this is nice! I wish I didn’t have to go, believe me! But
unfortunately I have to. (He gets up and Joey moves over next to Ross.) Oh uh, by the way,
what’s the name the girl you’re dating?"
163,Chandler, Bye! (Exits.)
166,Ross, Well obviously only one of us can keep dating her.
167,Joey," Obviously! So, how do we decide?"
168,Ross," Well now let’s-let’s look at this objectively, I think I should
date her…"
169,Joey," (not buying it) Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Or, or I’m the one who dates
her."
170,Ross," That’s interesting, but check this out. I date her…"
171,Joey, Yeah-yeah I like that but just to go in another direction…
172,Ross," Okay, okay. This can go on for a while."
173,Joey, Yeah well we should order some food then.
174,Ross," No Joey! Look why don’t, why don’t we just let her decide? Okay?
Hey-hey, we’ll each go out with her one more time. And-and we’ll see who
she likes best."
175,Joey, (smiling) That sounds fair.
176,Ross," Maybe I’ll take her to that new French restaurant down the
street…"
177,Joey," Ah yeah—wait a second now! Look we’re gonna have to set a
spending limit on the date. I don’t have the money to take her to a fancy place like
that."
178,Ross," Well sorry, that’s what I do on dates."
179,Joey," All right, well I guess I’ll just have to do what I do on dates."
180,Ross, So let’s decide on the spending limit…
181,Joey," Yeah. Uh, (thinks)…a slice…(Thinks)…six dollars?"
182,Ross, I was thinking more like a hundred.
183,Joey, Okay. Can I borrow 94 dollars?
185,Monica, Oh…
186,Phoebe, I know. Hand me a tissue. (Monica hands her one.)
188,Rachel, You’re out of Diet Coke.
190,Monica," Hello? (Listens) What?! (Listens) You what?! (Listens) Hey you listen
here missy! (Listens) Wh—(She is hung up on.)"
191,Phoebe, What?!
192,Monica," That was that girl Megan! She booked the Swing Kings on the day of our
wedding and said that I couldn’t have them back unless I gave her the dress!"
193,Phoebe, (gasps) Does that mean Carcass is available?
194,Monica," What am I gonna do?! That is the dress! That is the dress!
Wh…Chandler wants the band. What do I do?"
195,Phoebe, Well just figure out a way to talk him out of it.
196,Monica, How?
198,Rachel, You’re out of toilet paper!
200,Joey, (entering) Hey!
201,Ross, Hey! What’s up?
202,Joey," I just wanted to come by and y’know, wish you good luck on your date."
203,Ross, Oh thanks!
204,Joey, Yeah. What time are you meeting her?
205,Ross, We have 800 reservations at Grammercy Bistero.
206,Joey," Wow, that’s in like 20 minutes. You’d better get dressed."
207,Ross, I am dressed.
208,Joey," Oh. Well good! (To himself) For me. (He picks up a jar of lotion.) What is
this? Did you give yourself a facial?"
209,Ross, I have an oily T-zone!
210,Joey," Okay dude! (Finds a receit.) Hey you uh, you sent Kristen flowers."
211,Ross, That’s right.
212,Joey, You spent a hundred dollars. That’s the limit. You’re screwed!
213,Ross," Uh actually, I sent the flowers before the actual date. So techincally, technically
I didn’t break any rules. Thanks for stopping by though."
214,Joey," Oh-oh! So that’s the way it’s gonna be huh? Yeah I can break the
rules too y’know!"
215,Ross, Oh yeah? What are you gonna do?
216,Joey, I don’t know.
217,Ross, Why am I not surprised?
218,Joey, Y’know what Ross? I’m not gonna let you get away with this!
219,Ross, I don’t think you have much choice.
220,Joey, Well we’ll see!
221,Ross, Bye-bye!
222,Joey," Yeah bye-bye! (Exits and comes back in still holding the lotion.) Hey! So
just a light layer?"
223,Ross," Yes. Yes. Just here (Runs his fingers down the bridge of his nose) and
there (Runs his fingers across his forehead)."
225,Chandler," Joey got meat sauce on the banister again! (He goes into the bathroom
to wash his hands.)"
226,Phoebe," Yeah, swing music is so out."
227,Monica," Phoebe, he’s gotta be in the room for that to work."
228,Chandler, (returning) What are you guys talking about?
229,Monica," Well umm, we were just talking about the y’know, the Swing Kings
and just wondering whether y’know, they were the right way to go."
230,Rachel," Yeah, I went to a wedding once where they had swing music and uh, two
months later the couple got divorced. And now I’m not saying that there’s any
connection here y’know, but they did tell me that’s why they got divorced."
231,Chandler, But I love swing music!
232,Phoebe," Yeah but the Swing Kings? Y’know they suck so much that people
actually die at their concerts—They just stop living."
233,Chandler," Look all I know is when Monica and I went to see them, we had fun! And
there’s another reason too."
234,Rachel," Well, what is the other reason?"
235,Chandler, I don’t want to say.
236,Rachel, Well you have to because maybe it’s stupid.
237,Chandler," Well it’s just while Monica and I were dancing to them it
was…the first time I knew that…you were the woman I wanted to dance all my
dances with."
238,Monica, Oh crap!
240,Ross, So they said our table will be ready in just a few minutes.
242,Ross, Yeah.
244,Ross," Oh yeah it’s fine. I guess the more muscles you have the more they
can spasim out of control."
245,Joey, (entering) Kristen?
247,Joey, Hi!
249,Joey," Oh I like this place. And technically, technically I’m not breaking
any rules so I…"
251,Joey, Hi!
252,Ross," Hi. (They shake hands.) It’s nice to meet you. I used to have a
friend named Joey. I don’t anymore."
254,Ross, Yeah. So…
255,Joey, Sure! I would love to wait with you guys! Thanks! (Sits down.)
256,Ross," So Joey umm, you look familiar. Are uh, are you on TV or something?"
258,Ross," That’s right! That’s right, don’t you play a woman?"
259,Joey, A woman in a man’s body.
260,Ross, Much better.
261,Joey," So y’know Ross it’s funny ‘cause, you look familiar to me
too. Have you ever been married?"
262,Ross," Well yes, yes I have. In fact umm, just the other day Kristen and I were
talking about how I’ve been married and how I have a son."
264,Ross," That’s right! Wait no, Ben."
265,Joey, So you’ve just married the one time then?
266,Ross, Well umm…
268,Ross," Yes. And another time after that. Boy I’m getting hungry! Hey Joey,
have you ever been so hungry on a date that when a girl goes to the bathroom you eat some
of her food?"
270,Joey," (laughs that one off) Yeah. So uh Ross, well now—why did that first
marriage breakup? Was it because the woman was straight or she was a lesbian?"
273,Joey," No. It just seems like Ross is the kind of a guy that would marry a woman
on the verge of being a lesbian and then push her over the edge."
275,Ross, Wait a minute! Were you on a poster for gonorrhea?
276,Joey, Have you ever slept in the same bed as a monkey?!
277,Ross, Hey you leave Marcel out of this!
278,Joey, Fine! Have you ever got stuck in a pair of your own leather pants?!
279,Ross, Hey-hey have you ever locked yourself in a TV cabinet VD boy?!
280,Joey, Monkey lover!
282,Joey, When do you think we lost her?
283,Ross, Probably around gonorrhea.
285,Chandler," Hi, honey! I’m home!"
286,Monica, (from the bedroom) Don’t come in here!
287,Chandler, Why? Do you another boyfriend in there or something?
288,Monica, No! We only mess around at his place!
289,Chandler," Y’know it’s funny I started it but, now it’s scary me.
So could you come out here please?"
290,Monica," No, I’m wearing a wedding dress."
291,Chandler, Oh you got a wedding dress? That’s great!
292,Monica, Yeah but I’m not keeping it.
293,Chandler, Well then why can’t I see it?
294,Monica," Oh. I guess you can. Okay but; I-I have to return it, so you can’t
like it."
295,Chandler," Okay I promise. I’ll-I’ll hate it. (She enters.) Wow!
You-you look…hideous."
296,Monica, Really?
297,Chandler," Yeah, that’s like the most ugliest dress I’ve ever seen.
Wh-why do you to return it?"
298,Monica," Oh because it doesn’t…really fit. Oh by the way, I-I booked
the Swing Kings."
299,Chandler," Oh that’s great! Great! Thanks! But that dress I mean it’s
like yuck! It’s terrible! It makes me wanna just rip it right off of you!"
300,Monica," Okay! But you can’t rip it. Well, maybe a little."
301,Chandler, Okay!
304,Monica," (entering) Hey guys! Do you wanna look at the song list for the wedding?
(They ignore her.) Guys?"
305,Chandler, (without turning around) I thought you were gonna be gone all day.
306,Monica, All right? What’s going on?
308,Monica," I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I-I should probably leave you girls
alone. (She heads for the bedroom.)"
309,Ross," Yeah, laugh all you want but in ten minutes we’re gonna have younger
looking skin!"
310,Joey," Yeah! (Monica goes in the bedroom.) Y’know, she could use a
little…(Whistles that she needs to do what they’re doing.) (Something happens on
the game.) Oh nice shot!!! (They all cheer.)"
0,Joey," Hey! You guys! You’re not gonna believe this! I just got off the
phone with my agent…"
1,Phoebe," Oh my God! (Joey looks at her.) I’m sorry, too soon. You go."
2,Joey, Okay. I got nominated for my part on Days of Our Lives!
3,Monica, Joey!
4,Phoebe, Good for you!
5,Monica, Congratulations! Wow! I can’t believe you’re nominated for an Emmy!
6,Joey, No-no.
7,Monica, Oh Soap Opera Digest award!
8,Joey, No! I’m up for a Soapie!
9,Monica, Honey? Is that something you’re making up?
10,Joey," No, no, no! It’s real! And it has been since 1998. (Rachel returns
from the bathroom.) Hey Rach! Rach! I’m up for a Soapie!"
11,Rachel," (gasps) Oh my God! Oh my God!! That is like the third most prestigious
soap opera award there is!"
12,Joey," Thank you! Well, I guess now I know who I’m taking to the awards.
(Points to Rachel.)"
13,Rachel," Oh, stop that! Don’t kid about that! (Gasps) Will all the stars be
there?"
14,Joey, Many are scheduled to appear.
15,Rachel, Oh my God! Oh my God! I can’t go! I’m gonna be too nervous!
16,Monica," (to Joey) Okay, I’ll go!"
17,Rachel, No!! You are getting married! This is all I have.
20,Ross," …and it was Ernst Muhlbrat who first hypothesized that the
Velociraptor would expand it’s collar and emit a high pitched noise to frighten
it’s predator. (A student raises his hand.) Yes Mr. Lewis? "
22,Ross, Just a high pitched intimidating noise.
24,Ross," Well we-we don’t know for sure. But in my head it-it sounded
something like this. (He makes a high pitched noise and Alan doesn’t know what to
make of it.) Of course, this is just conjecture. Okay, that’s uh, that’s all for
today. (Everyone starts to get up.) Uh Mr. Morse, can I see you for a moment? "
26,Ross," Mr. Morse I need to talk to you about your mid-term exam, I’m afraid
I-I had to fail you."
28,Ross, Well you need 60% to pass…
30,Ross, Seven.
32,Ross, No-no it’s not. What-what happened there Ned?
34,Ross," Well I’m sorry but, that-that’s really not my problem."
36,Ross, Well that brings me in the loop a little.
38,Ross," Okay! (Walks away from him.) Umm, I uh, I’m your teacher. I’m
sorry, you’re-you’re a student and I-and I like women. In spite of what may be
written on the backs of some of these chairs."
40,Phoebe, Oh my God! That guy at the counter is totally checking you out!
41,Monica," Really? (Looks.) My God, he’s really cute."
42,Phoebe, Go for it.
43,Monica," Phoebe, I’m engaged!"
44,Phoebe," I’m just saying, get his number just in case. But no Chandler is in
an accident and can’t perform sexually and he would want you to take a lover to
satisfy the needs that he can no longer fulfill."
46,Monica," Op, can I just tell you something? Very flattered but umm, I’m
engaged. (Points to her ring.)"
48,Monica, Well you should be embarrassed. (Leaves.)
50,Phoebe," I did, but that was really fun."
52,Joey," (pretending to be an announcer) And the winner is…Joey Tribbiani! (He
then gets excited and goes over to the counter to practice his acceptance speech using a
bottle of maple syrup as the award.) Oh… Wow! I honestly never expected this. I uh, I
didn’t prepare a speech. But umm, I’d like to thank (Rachel enters quietly) my
parents, who’ve always been there for me. I’d also like to thank my friends,
Chandler, Monica, Phoebe, Rachel…"
53,Rachel," I’m fourth! (Joey is startled.) Look at you with your little maple
syrup award!"
54,Joey, Yeah may-maybe you don’t tell anyone about this.
55,Rachel," What? No! It’s not a big deal! I do that too, with my shampoo
bottle."
56,Joey, Really?
57,Rachel, Yeah.
58,Joey, What award are you practicing for?
59,Rachel," Grammy, Best New Artist."
60,Joey," Oh, hey listen! The Soapie’s called today and I also get to present
an award."
61,Rachel, Ohh that’s great!
62,Joey, Yeah!
63,Rachel," So you’ll definitely get onstage, even if you don’t win."
64,Joey, (confused) What you-you don’t think I’m gonna win?
65,Rachel," Well of course I do! But y’know, favorite returning character is a
tough category Joey. I mean you’re up against the guy who survived his own cremation."
66,Joey," Yeah. No-no I-I know I might not win, but it’s just…I’ve
never even been nominated before! I want it so much."
67,Rachel," Well Joey, you’ll probably get it. But you should probably
your-your gracious loser face. Y’know when like the cameras are on you and you wanna
look disappointed but also that your colleague deserved to win. Y’know? So it’s
sorta like… (Does it, you’ll have to see it.)"
68,Joey, Hey! (Likes it.)
69,Rachel, Y’know?
70,Joey, You practice losing the Grammies too?
71,Rachel," Oh no, at the Grammies I always win."
72,Joey, Ah.
74,Phoebe, Oh hey!
75,Monica, Hey! How’d your date go with Jake?
76,Phoebe," Oh, great! We couldn’t keep our eyes off each other all night and
then every once and a while y’know, he’d kinda lean over and stroke my hair and
touch my neck. (Does that to Monica.)"
77,Monica," Okay, stop it Phoebe, you’re getting me all tingly."
78,Phoebe," (laughs) All I could think of was y’know, ""Is he gonna kiss
me? Is he gonna kiss me?"""
79,Monica, And did he?
80,Phoebe," I’m a lady Monica, I don’t kiss and tell. But this hickey
speaks for itself. (She starts to open up her blouse.)"
81,Monica," Okay-okay, I got it. I got it."
82,Phoebe," I just like him so much that I just feel like I’ve had 10 drinks
today and I’ve only had six."
83,Monica," Oh, I haven’t had that feeling since I first started going out with
Chandler. Wow, I’m never gonna have that feeling again am I?"
84,Phoebe, You sound like a guy.
85,Monica," No, a guy would be saying, ""I’m never gonna get to sleep with
anyone else."" Oh my God! I’m never gonna get to sleep with anyone else!
I’ve been so busy planning the wedding that I forgot about all the things that
I’d be giving up! I mean, I…I’m never gonna have a first kiss again."
86,Phoebe, You’ll have a last kiss.
88,Ross, Can I ask you something? Have you ever had a guy have a crush on you?
89,Joey, Is that why you wanted to tie my tie?
90,Ross, There’s this kid in my class who said he’s in love with me.
91,Joey, Whoa!
92,Rachel, (entering from her room) Whoa what?
93,Joey, Ross has a boyfriend.
94,Ross," I do-I do not have a boyfriend. There’s a guy in one of my
classes who-who has a crush on me."
95,Rachel, Really?
96,Ross," Yeah! I don’t know. I mean, last year Elizabeth now-now this kid.
What-what-what-what is it?! Am I giving out some kind of…sexy professor vibe? (Rachel
and Joey both look at him.)"
97,Rachel, Not right now.
98,Ross, It-it—The point is my natural charisma has made him fail his midterm.
99,Rachel," Oh, see now I feel bad for the kid! I had a crush on a teacher once and
it was so hard! Y’know you—I couldn’t concentrate and I blushed every time
he looked at me. I mean come on, you remember what’s it’s like to be 19 and in
love."
100,Ross, Yeah. I guess I can cut him some slack.
101,Rachel, Yeah.
102,Joey, How’d you get over that teacher?
103,Rachel, I didn’t. I got under him.
104,Joey, (To Ross) Problem solved.
107,Phoebe, Okay bye. (They kiss.)
109,Phoebe," Bye! (Phoebe goes over and joins Monica on the couch.) We said good-bye
at the door so as not to flaunt our new love."
110,Monica," Phoebe, it’s okay. You don’t have to tip toe around me.
I-I’ve been thinking about it and umm, y’know what? I’m okay about not
having that new relationship feeling…"
112,Phoebe, (yelling back) I miss you too!!!! (He walks away.)
113,Monica," See? That’s what I mean. I mean that, that’s great! But
I wouldn’t trade in what I have for that. I mean I’m gonna be with Chandler for
the rest of my life, and that’s what makes me happy. (Chandler approaches.) Hey
sweetie, come here! Come sit down. Hey Phoebe and I were just talking about how our
relationship is deep and meaningful. It really is don’t you think?"
114,Chandler, Oh totally! (Holds up his finger.) Pull my finger.
118,Joey, (To Rachel) This is it! This is my category.
119,Rachel, I know! My God! Do you have your speech?
120,Joey," Yeah, I got my speech!"
121,Rachel, Do you got your gracious loser face?
122,Joey, Yeah. (Does it.)
123,Rachel," Now Joey remember, if you win you have to hug me! You hug me!"
124,Joey, Okay. Can I squeeze your ass?
125,Rachel, On TV?! Yeah!
126,Joey, ‘Kay! 
129,Joey," What the?! (Joey pounds the table and starts yelling at Rachel, and which
is drowned out by applause. Rachel is desperately trying to tell Joey that he’s on TV
right now. He finally notices and he does his gracious loser face.)"
133,Joey," (angrily and monotone) Any one of the brilliant actresses nominated for
this award tonight deserves to take it home. Unfortunately only one can. (Shakes his head
in disgust.) The nominees for Best Supporting Actress are from Passions Erin Goff.
(There is applause, which Joey disgustedly waits to dye out.) From One Life to Live
Mary Loren Bishop (They start to applaud again, but Joey interrupts in with the rest of
the nominees), from All My Children Sarah Mchann, and from Days of Our Lives
Jessica Ashley. And the winner is…(Opens the envelope)…Jessica Ashley from Days
of Our Lives. (Applause) Uh, unfortunately Jessica couldn’t be with us tonight so
I’ll be accepting this award on her behalf. (Realizes something) And I’m sure
that Jessica would like to thank my parents who always believed in me. She’d also
like to thank my friends, Chandler, Monica, Ross, Phoebe, and Rachel who’s
sittin’ right there! (Points at Rachel.) (The music starts and his microphone is
turned off, this angers Joey again and he disgustedly exits.)"
135,Rachel, Joey! Why did we have to rush out of there so fast?!
136,Joey," Rach we had to get out of there because, look what I won! (He whips out
the award for Best Supporting Actress that he accepted for Jessica.)"
137,Rachel, Oh my God you stole her award!
138,Joey," No-no! No, I’m accepting it on her behalf. (He puts it up above the
TV to display it.)"
139,Rachel, Joey I don’t think you know what behalf means.
140,Joey," Sure I do! It’s a verb! As in, ""I behalfin’ it!"""
141,Rachel," Joey, you have got to take this back!"
142,Joey," But why?! I should’ve won one and I really want it and she
didn’t even care enough to come to the thing! It could also be a Grammy."
143,Rachel, (looking at the award) No! Joey!
144,Joey," Come on Rach! No one saw me take it! There was a whole table full of
‘em."
145,Rachel, Do you really want an award you didn’t win?
146,Joey," No! I want an award I did win! But nobody’s giving me any of those!
Plus—Hey Rach, if-if I put it up there (Points to the TV) right? When people come
over they’ll see it and they’ll think I won it."
147,Rachel, Joey is says Best Supporting Actress!
148,Joey, I can scratch that right off.
149,Rachel," Joey no, this is wrong! You have to take it back, okay? You don’t
want to win an award this way. You’re very talented. And someday you’re gonna
win one of these for real and that one is gonna mean something."
150,Joey, All right!
151,Rachel, All right? (He sets the award down.) Thank you.
152,Joey, I’ll take it back tomorrow.
153,Rachel, Thank you.
155,Joey," (opening his door) If I can’t have it you can’t have it! (Rachel
walks away angrily.)"
158,Ross," (turning towards him) Yes Mr. Lewis, how can I help you?"
160,Ross, And why exactly would I do that? (Goes back to writing on the board.)
162,Ross, (turning around and dragging the chalk down the board) What?!
164,Ross, No!
166,Ross," Well that’s different! Okay? Because he, he was actually in love with
me!"
168,Ross, What?
170,Ross, I can’t believe someone would do that for a grade.
174,Monica, Have you seen Chandler?
175,Phoebe, No. Why?
176,Monica," ‘Cause I just keeping thinking about all these things that I’m
not gonna have and it’s freaking me out. I don’t know what to do about it."
177,Phoebe," Okay, don’t sweat it. (Looking around her.) Chandler is nowhere
around so go ahead get it out of your system. That guy’s cute. (Points to a guy
sitting behind Monica.)"
178,Monica," Phoebe! Come on I’m serious! I just got to talk to him about all
this."
179,Phoebe, No that is the last thing you want to do!
180,Monica, Why?
181,Phoebe, Because you’re marrying him!
182,Monica, You gotta help me out here Pheebs.
183,Phoebe," All right, I’ve never been engaged and I’ve never really been
married, but I can only tell you what my mother told me. Whenever you have doubts or fears
or anxieties about a relationship, do not communicate them to your husband."
184,Monica," So I’m not supposed to share my doubts and fears with the guy
I’m gonna spend the rest of my life with?"
185,Phoebe," That is correct! Yes, you’re supposed to take all of that stuff and
put it in a little box in your mind and then lock it up tight."
186,Monica, Your mother told you this?
187,Phoebe, Yes!
188,Monica," The woman that got married a bunch of times and killed herself when you
were 13?"
189,Phoebe," Oh my God! You’re right! Go! (Monica starts to leave.) Go tell
Chandler! Hurry before it’s too late! Wait no! (Monica stops.) Does this also mean
putting out doesn’t get you love? (Monica is shocked.)"
191,Rachel, I cannot believe I’m gonna meet Jessica Ashley!
192,Joey, Okay wait-wait p-please be cool! Okay? I work with this woman.
193,Rachel," Okay, I’m totally cool! (She coolly knocks on the door)"
196,Joey, Hey Jessica.
197,Rachel, (coolly) Hey Jess.
198,Joey," Ah, this is my friend Rachel."
200,Rachel, ‘Sup? (Joey glares at her.)
201,Joey," Uh listen, here’s your Soapie. I accepted it for ya. (Hands it to
her.)"
203,Joey," Well, that-that-that’s it? You’re gonna, you’re gonna put
it on your self or anything?"
205,Joey, (To Rachel) Take it back?
206,Rachel, Absolutely.
207,Joey," Y-y-yeah! (As they start to leave, Rachel pauses and steals a vase with
flowers in it.) Yeah you do. (They exit.)"
209,Monica," Honey, as we get closer to the wedding, is there anything that you would
like to talk about or share?"
210,Chandler," Okay. Well, I think the centerpieces are too big"
211,Monica," You’re wrong! The centerpieces are fine! Do you ever get scared at
all?"
212,Chandler, Kinda. They’re really big.
213,Monica," Doesn’t it ever just freak you out that-that you’re never
gonna be with anybody new again?"
214,Chandler, What?
215,Monica," Just, I love you so much. Just…It’s just sometimes it bothers
me that I’m never gonna have that feeling. Y’know when you meet someone for the
first time and it’s new and exciting? Y’know that rush?"
216,Chandler," No. No, see when I first meet somebody it’s uh it’s mostly
panic, anxiety, and a great deal of sweating."
217,Monica," Okay, but all right you’re a guy, does it not freak you that
you’re never gonna sleep with anybody else?"
218,Chandler," Sleeping with somebody new, anxiety, panic, and I’m afraid even
more sweating."
219,Monica, Even with me?
220,Chandler," I was dangerously dehydrated during the first six months of our
relationship. (Monica laughs.) Look, for me the rush is knowing that we are gonna be
together for the rest of our lives."
221,Monica, Really?
222,Chandler," Well yeah! But now that I know that you’re having these thoughts,
I’m back to panic, anxiety, and uh I’m definitely gonna need some kind of sports
drink."
223,Monica," Come here! Come here! (They hug.) Sweetie you don’t have to worry.
No, besides y’know what? I’m gonna have a lot of new things with you. The first
time we buy a house. Our first kid. Our first grandkid…"
224,Chandler, (hoarsely) Water! Water! Water!
226,Ross," Uh Mr. Morse, can I speak to you for a moment?"
228,Ross," Uh-hmm, yeah-yeah do you like it? Do-do you looove it? I just want you to
know that I’m changing your grade back."
230,Ross," ‘Cause I know what you’re trying to pull here. Okay? It’s
not gonna work."
232,Ross," Y’know what? I-I’m not even gonna talk about this. Okay? This
little thing is over. I know you have a girlfriend! Okay—(Ned looks
shocked)—Yeah! And I know about the other professors! How do you think that makes me
feel Ned?! You used me! You don’t love me and you never did! (Ross turns around to
make a grand exit but runs into two colleagues.) Ah Professor Winston, Professor
Fredrickson, I’ll be right with you. (To Ned) Don’t make this worse and
I’ll give you a C. (To the professors) Shall we? (They leave.)"
235,Phoebe, Rach? 
236,Rachel, I’ll be out in a second.
238,Phoebe," Oh. (Picks it up.) It’s just so unexpected! I…I uh…Boy
I’ll tell you it’s just such an honor to be nominated for a Nobel Prize
and y’know to win one for a massage. Especially after having just won a Tony
award for best actress in…"
239,Rachel," (entering from her room) Honey, we have to go. Our reservations are at
800."
240,Phoebe," …in Reservations at 800 by Neil Simon. (To an imaginary Neil
Simon) Thank-thank you Neil. Thank you for the words. (Blows him a kiss.)"
241,Rachel," Okay honey, you can finish this later we’re gonna be late. We gotta
go."
242,Phoebe," Please, don’t play the music. Just uh one more. LIVE FROM NEW
YORK! IT’S SATURDAY NIGHT!!"
0,Phoebe, (To Joey) Oh hey! How was your audition?
1,Joey," I’m sorry, do I know you?"
2,Phoebe, What are you doing?
3,Joey," Nothing, I’m just practicing blowing you off because I’m gonna
be a big movie star!"
4,Phoebe, Oh! You got it?!
5,Joey," Well, no not yet. But the audition went really good."
6,Monica, What was it for?
7,Joey," Oh, it’s this big budget period movie about these three Italian
brothers who come to America around the turn of the century. It’s really classy! Oh,
and the director is supposed to be the next, next Martin Scorcese."
8,Phoebe," The next, next?"
9,Joey," Yeah, there’s this guy from Chicago who’s supposed to be the
next Martin Scorcese, all right? But then this guy’s right after him. (Joey’s
cell phone rings and he answers it.) Hello!"
11,Joey, (to Monica and Phoebe) They loved me!
13,Joey, (on phone) Oh my God!
15,Joey," Are you kidding me? I never rent a movie without it! (Listens) Oh.
(Listens) Uh, okay uh let me call you back. (Hangs up.)"
16,Phoebe, What’s the matter?
17,Joey, They want me to be totally naked in the movie!
18,Monica, Wow!
19,Joey, I know! My grandmother’s gonna see this!
20,Phoebe, Grandma’s gonna have to get in line.
23,Phoebe, Hey the wedding is so close! Are you getting nervous?
24,Monica," Yeah. But a part of me also can’t wait ‘til it’s over.
Chandler and I have this pact not to have sex again until the wedding."
25,Ross," A no sex pact huh? I actually have one of those going on with every woman
in America."
26,Monica," Hey Phoebe, will you give me a hand? "
27,Phoebe, Sure.
28,Monica," I gotta make up the guest bedroom. (To Ross) Hey, Cousin Cassie is
coming to stay with us a few days."
29,Ross, Cassie?
30,Monica, Uh-hmm.
31,Ross," Wow, I haven’t seen her for like forever. I wonder if she still
carries that Barbie everywhere she goes."
32,Monica," Ross, she’s 25 years old."
33,Ross, So what! I still have—No you’re probably right.
34,Rachel, (entering) Hi!
35,Monica, Hey!
36,Phoebe, Hey!
37,Rachel," Hey Pheebs, can I talk to you over here for a second?"
38,Phoebe, Yeah!
39,Monica, Subtle guys!
40,Phoebe, What?!
41,Monica, I know you’re planning my surprise bridal shower.
42,Rachel," (laughs) Well okay—Well don’t ruin it! Just play along at
least!"
43,Monica, Okay. Sorry. (She goes into the guest bedroom.)
44,Rachel, (To Phoebe) Oh my God! We have to throw her a shower?!
46,Monica, Hey! What did you decide to do about the movie?
47,Joey," I don’t know! It’s not like it’s porn! This is a serious,
legitimate movie. Y’know? And the nudity is really important to the story."
48,Monica, That’s what you say about porn.
49,Joey, You’re right. Maybe I shouldn’t even go on the call back.
50,Monica," No! No you should! A lot of major actors do nude scenes! I mean the
chance to star in a movie? Come on!"
51,Joey," Well that’s true. And I am only naked in one scene. Plus it sounds
really great. My character’s catholic and he falls in love with this Jewish girl. Who
run away together and they get caught in this big rainstorm. So we go into this barn and
undress each other and hold each other. It’s really sweet and-and tender."
52,Monica," Plus, everyone’s gonna see your thing. (Giggles.)"
54,Phoebe, Well when can we have this shower?
55,Rachel," She has got so much going on we-we have only two options. We have
Friday…"
56,Phoebe, Well that’s only two days away. What is the other option?
57,Rachel, Yesterday!
58,Phoebe," Well if we make it yesterday, woo-hoo! We’re done!"
59,Rachel," Oh my God Phoebe, this is impossible! We can’t do this by Friday!
We have to find a place. We have to invite people! We have to get food! There’s just
too much to do! It’s impossible! We can’t do it! We cannot do it! We cannot do
it!"
60,Phoebe," Rachel, calm down!"
61,Rachel," (calmly) Okay. I’m sorry. You’re right, you’re right."
62,Phoebe, (grabs and shakes Rachel) Just calm down woman!
63,Rachel," Phoebe, I already, I already did."
64,Phoebe," Oh okay. All right, then I need to calm down a little."
65,Rachel," Okay. Okay. (They sit down.) I think we can do this if we just get
organized. All right? We have two days to plan this party. We just need to make fast
decisions! Okay? All right, where are we gonna have it?"
66,Phoebe," Uh, here. What time?"
67,Rachel, 4 o’clock. Food?
68,Phoebe, Finger sandwiches and tea.
69,Rachel, Ooh great! Very Monica.
70,Phoebe, And chili!
71,Rachel," Ah you went one too far. Uh, flowers or balloons?"
72,Phoebe, Both!
73,Rachel, We’re paying for this y’know.
74,Phoebe, Neither.
75,Rachel," Okay. Umm, what should we do for the theme?"
76,Phoebe, Lusts of the flesh.
77,Rachel, (pause) What?
78,Phoebe, I don’t know. (Timidly) A cowboy theme?
80,Chandler, Hey!
81,Monica, Hey!
82,Chandler," Y’know I’m-I’m really glad we decided not to sleep
together before the wedding."
83,Monica, Oh boy me too!
84,Chandler," Y’know I was thinking if we had a…a big fight and uh we
broke up for a few hours…"
85,Monica, Yeah?
86,Chandler," Technically we could have sex again. What do you think, bossy and
domineering?!"
87,Monica," The wedding is off, sloppy and immature!"
88,Chandler, That’s me! Come on!
89,Monica," Okay. (They both jump up to head for there room, but Monica stops.) But
wait, we can’t. My Cousin Cassie is in the guest room, we’re supposed to have
lunch."
90,Chandler," Well get rid of her, obsessive and shrill."
91,Monica, Shrill?! The wedding is back on!
94,Chandler, (transfixed) Hi! Nice to meet you!
96,Monica," So, are you ready to go?"
99,Monica, (catching him) Chandler!
100,Chandler, I’ll be right with you.
102,Monica, (To Ross) Cassie needs to stay at your place.
103,Ross, What—why?
104,Monica, Because Purvry Perverson over here can’t stop staring at her.
105,Ross, What?! Chandler she’s our cousin!
106,Chandler," I was not staring at her. Okay? I was just listening intently.
It’s called being a good conversationalist. Watch. (Stares at Monica’s eyes.)
Say something."
107,Monica, You were staring about eight inches south of there.
108,Ross," Fine, she can stay at my place. By the way, what-what does Cassie even
look like now."
109,Monica, She looks exactly like Aunt Marilyn.
110,Chandler," Umm, so this Aunt Marilyn is-is-is-is she coming to the wedding?"
111,Monica, Wafer thin ice!
113,Joey," Hey, I’m back!"
115,Joey," Uh so, will-will I be reading the same scene again?"
117,Joey," Oh great! Y’know I would’ve been perfect for this part, but
whatever! Y’know, thanks for making a bad decision and ruining your movie! Good day!
(Starts to leave.)"
119,Joey," And scene! Huh? Wasn’t that fun? We did a little improv there. Yeah!
Okay! So you-you-you-you were saying?"
121,Joey, Wow! Sure! That’s great!
123,Joey," Yeah! Yeah sure, just long as it’s handled tastefully and that barn
is not too cold."
125,Joey, So…What?
127,Joey, Yes!
129,Joey, No. What?
131,Joey, Barmifsaed?
134,Monica, So to get this part you can’t be?
135,Joey, Nope.
136,Monica, But you are?
137,Joey, Yep.
138,Monica, But you told them you weren’t?
139,Joey, That’s right.
140,Monica," Wow! Wow! And it’s definitely all gone? There’s nothing there
to work with? (Joey glares at her.) What were you thinking?"
141,Joey," I don’t know! I really want this part! And they tell you no matter
what you get asked at an audition you say yes. Like if-if they want you to ride a horse,
you tell ‘em you can! And just figure out how to do it later."
142,Monica," Joey! This is not like learning to ride a horse! This is like learning
to…grow a turtleneck!"
143,Joey," I kn-I know! I know! Okay? And apparently tomorrow when I go in to meet
the director I have to take off my clothes so that they can see what my body looks like."
144,Monica," Oh my God, what are you gonna do?!"
145,Joey," I just have to call my agent and tell her I can’t do the part. (Gets
up for the phone.)"
146,Monica, Unless!
147,Joey, Unless what?
148,Monica," Well, this may sound crazy, but there maybe something we could fashion."
149,Joey, Like what?
150,Monica," Well I’m not sure yet, but umm of the top of my head I’m
thinking double sided tape and some sort of luncheon meat."
152,Phoebe," Hey! I’ve got a great idea for party favors for the shower. Okay,
we get some uh mahogany boxes and carve everyone’s names in them and inside is
everyone’s individual birth stone."
153,Rachel," Okay. Okay. All right, you take care of that. And meanwhile, the party
is tomorrow and we still don’t have a guest list."
154,Phoebe," Okay. Okay! Well okay, who do we know that’s coming? Me. Are you?"
155,Monica, (entering) Hey!
156,Phoebe, Hey!
157,Rachel, Hey! What’s up Mon?
158,Monica," Well uh, I’m trying to make something for Joey. Do you mind if I
raid your fridge?"
159,Rachel, Have at it.
160,Monica," Okay. (Opens the fridge.) All right, turkey. Eh, that won’t work.
Cheese? (Picks it up) That won’t work. Olive loaf? (Picks it up) I hope that
won’t work."
161,Rachel, Are you makin’ him a sandwich?
162,Monica," No it’s umm, more like a wrap. Okay so uh, I’m gonna go guys. "
164,Monica," I guess you can get back to deciding on what to get me for a present!
(Runs out.)"
165,Rachel," (To Phoebe, after Monica’s gone) We have to get her a present?!"
166,Phoebe," Okay but look! Look at what I got! It’s her address book! (Holds it
up.) We have a guest list!"
167,Rachel, Oh my God you’re amazing! Did you just pull that out of her purse?
168,Phoebe," Uh-huh, and a little seed money for the party. (Holds up $40.)"
170,Ross, (shocked at her beauty) Cassie?!
172,Ross, Hey!
174,Ross," Oh. Oh, that’s right. So-so you did see me that day because it seemed
like you didn’t."
176,Ross," It’s okay. Come, come on in."
178,Ross, Oh.
181,Ross, Uh-huh. Yeah I-I have a knack for impressions.
183,Ross, Yeah—No!!
186,Ross," Cassie, how you-how you doin’ on that…hot dog."
188,Ross, (quietly) Thank God.
190,Ross," Oh right. Right. Ooh, remember the time I uh, I pinned you down and
tickled you ‘til you cried? (She laughs) We’re probably too old to do that now."
192,Ross," (looking then moving away quickly) Uh-huh! Uh-huh! And-and-and I’ll
always remember that summer because that’s when I realized that we are related."
194,Ross," Well I’m, I’m a little slow. (To himself) Just as our children
would be."
196,Phoebe, Hi!
198,Phoebe," How are you? (The woman nods) Good. (She goes over to another couple of
women.) Hi, thanks for coming."
201,Phoebe," Thank you. (To the other woman) No? (She nods.) All right. (She goes to
another pairing.) Oh, it’s so nice to see you."
204,Phoebe, Okay. (Goes over to Rachel.) Hey Rach?
205,Rachel, Yeah?
206,Phoebe, Who the hell are all these people?
207,Rachel," Well, I don’t know. I called all the people in Monica’s phone
book and these are the only ones who could show up on 24 hours notice."
208,Phoebe," Hmm, y’know there’s another word for people like that. Losers!"
210,Rachel," (to her) Hi! I’m Rachel. This is Phoebe. I’m the maid of
honor. How do you know Monica?"
212,Rachel, Ohhhh!
214,Rachel, That’s great!
217,Rachel," (to the woman) Excuse us for a minute. (They go into the kitchen.) You
didn’t tell her to come?!"
218,Phoebe, You were supposed to tell her!
219,Rachel," No I wasn’t! You were supposed to tell her to come and I was
supposed to bring the cake!"
220,Phoebe," Fine, I’ll go call her."
221,Rachel, Yes! And please tell her to bring a cake!
223,Monica," Okay, we have a lot of options here, a number of prototypes for you to
try on."
224,Joey, Wow! This looks great!
225,Monica," Yeah! Okay, this one is a mushroom cap. (Points to it.) Umm, this one is
made of bologna. (Points.)"
226,Joey, And-and-and-and-and the toothpicks?
227,Monica," Oh, just until the glue dries."
228,Joey, Thank God!
229,Monica," (to a whole group) Now, these are-are more realistic, but perishable. "
230,Joey, Ah.
231,Monica," Okay? (To a different group) Over here we have pink suede, which is
nice. But umm, if it gets wet then you know it’s gonna shrink."
232,Joey, Well maybe we just take that one away. (Picks it up and throws it away.)
233,Monica," I also, did a little something in fur. But umm, that’s really just
for me. (Rubs it against her cheek.) Okay. So, why don’t you go into your room and
try these on and we’ll see—get a better idea of what’s gonna work."
234,Joey," Thanks, you are such a good friend. And this is so weird."
236,Joey, Ow!
237,Monica, Toothpick?
238,Joey, Yeah.
239,Monica, What are you trying on now?
240,Joey, The fruit roll up.
241,Monica, And?
242,Joey, Delicious.
243,Monica, Joey!
244,Joey, Wait a minute! Wait a minute! We have a winner!
245,Monica, What?! Which one?!
246,Joey, The Silly Putty! It’s not so silly anymore!
249,Ross," (in his head) She’s your cousin. She’s your cousin! If
she knew what was going on in your head she’d think you were sick! (She grabs
some popcorn.) Or would she? Let’s back up a second. She was the one who
suggested opening a bottle of wine. She was the one who turned down the lights. She
was the one that wanted to rent Logan’s Run, the sexiest movie ever. (She
grabs the blanket from behind him and looks at him.) Oh, I know that look. Forget it. I
want it. She wants it. I’m going in. "
252,Ross," (in his head) Say something clever! (Pause.) Okay, doesn’t
have to be clever, it just has to be words. Say some words. (Pause) Any words will
do. (Pause) Oh my God! This is the longest that anyone has not talked ever! (Pause)
There is nothing you can say to make this worse!! So just say something!! (Pause.) (To
her) I-I, I uh haven’t had sex in a very long time. (She leaves.) (In his
head) Yeah, you really shouldn’t have said anything."
254,Monica," Phoebe! Rachel! It’s Monica! I wonder what you could possibly need
me for on such short notice! (She bursts into the apartment to find only Phoebe and Rachel
sitting on the couch.) Oh."
255,Rachel," Oh Monica, we are so sorry."
256,Monica, For what?
257,Rachel," Well first, for forgetting to throw you a bridal shower."
258,Phoebe, And then for forgetting to invite you to it.
259,Monica, You al-you already had it?
260,Phoebe," Yeah. Well, we called everyone in your phone book and bunch of people
came, but it took us so long to get you here that they-they had to leave."
261,Rachel," Yeah, we wanted to throw you a big surprise and a great shower, and now
you don’t have either."
262,Phoebe, We ruined everything.
263,Rachel, Ugh…
264,Monica," Well no wait a minute that’s not true! No, what did, that was
really sweet. And it kinda works out for the best."
265,Rachel," What do you, what do you mean?"
266,Monica," Well now, I get to spend my shower with the only people I really love! I
mean, I get all those presents (Motions to the pile in the corner) without having to talk
to people I don’t even like!"
268,Rachel, Surprise…
269,Phoebe, Sur-surprise.
270,Rachel, …Monica.
272,Joey," And what’s cool is, the character is from Naples, right? "
274,Joey, My whole family’s from Naples!
277,Joey," Oh! Hey right! Not a problem. (He starts taking off his clothes.) I
totally understand. You need to y’know make sure I don’t have any horrible scars
or tattoos. Don’t you worry; I have nothing to hide. (He drops his pants and stands
back up and looks down.) So there you go, that’s me. (We cut to a camera angle
looking at the casting director and movie director through Joey’s legs.) One hundred
percent natural! (Suddenly, there’s a thud as something falls off.) (Everyone is
shocked.) I tell ya, that has never happened before."
280,Phoebe," Cassie, are you finding everything okay in there?"
282,Phoebe," Oh! No problem! I… (Cassie emerges from the bathroom and we once
again visit slow motion Barry White background music land with the sexy hair-flipping
thing going on, only this time Phoebe is entranced. For more information on Denise
Richards you can visit your local library or look her up on the Internet at her official
website at www.deniserichards.com.)"
284,Phoebe," (in her head) Say something! Say anything! Ask her out! She’s
not your cousin!"
0,Rachel," Hey! Out of all of us, who do you think is gonna get married next?"
1,Joey, Probably Monica and Chandler.
6,Rachel," (to the gang) Oh my God, Melissa Warburton. I don’t think I have
the energy for this."
8,Rachel, (screaming) Melissa!
10,Rachel," Wh—(Turns and looks at the gang who’s staring)—Why
don’t I tell you over here? (She walks Melissa away from the gang.)"
12,Rachel," Oh no-no, no! It’s good! It’s all good! I-I actually work at Ralph
Lauren!"
14,Rachel, I will not! I’m the divisional head of men’s sportswear!
16,Rachel, Oh please…
18,Rachel, No.
20,Rachel," Oh tomorrow, oh I don’t know. Um…"
22,Rachel, Shut up.
24,Rachel," Oh, wow thanks! (Reading the card) Oh you’re in real estate!"
26,Rachel, Wow! What do you do now?
28,Rachel, Okay! (Joins the rest of the gang.)
29,Joey, Hey guys! Look who’s back! It’s Ray-ray!
30,Rachel, Shut up that was my friend Melissa from college.
31,Ross," She seems really, really fun!"
32,Rachel, She’s actually very sweet and we used to be very close.
33,Monica," Wait a minute, she isn’t… She’s not the one who you…"
34,Joey, (excitedly) Who you what? Who you what?!
35,Rachel, (To Monica) Yes.
36,Monica, Wow!
37,Joey, (excitedly) Wow? Wow what?! Wow what?! Who you—what?!!
38,Rachel, It’s not a big deal!
39,Monica, (To Joey) They were lovers.
40,Ross, What?!
41,Joey, What?!
42,Rachel," No we weren’t! It was nothing! It was one night, senior year we
went to a party, had a lot of sangria and y’know, ended up…kissing for a
bit."
43,Ross, So that’s two of my wives.
46,Monica," (telling Chandler the seating arrangement) Okay so this is where the
band is. (Points.) And this is where the bar is. (Points) And all these pins have
people’s names on them. (She has pins to show the seating at each of the tables.) And
Rach, here you are. (Points to Rachel’s place.)"
47,Rachel," Oh wow. Why don’t we just take me (Grabs her pin) and put me with a
Manhattan in my hand, talking to the cute bartender. (Puts her pin at the bar and laughs.
Monica just glares at her.) These pins aren’t for playing are they?"
48,Monica," (To Chandler) Okay, the red ones are my guests and the blue ones are
yours."
49,Chandler," This is so sad. I mean, I only have like ten pins."
50,Monica," Chandler, relax it’s not a contest. (To Rachel) Certainly not a
close one."
51,Joey, (entering) Hello!
52,Rachel, Hey!
53,Joey, Hey Rach. (Stares at her.) 
54,Rachel, Stop picturing it!!
55,Monica," Okay, I think that’s it. The seating chart is done. This is our
wedding. They all look like they’re having fun don’t they?"
56,Joey," Hey, so where are my parents gonna be?"
57,Monica," Oh! (Gets up) Let’s see, well…if this is the wedding hall then
umm (Walks away) you’re parents will be at home in Queens."
58,Joey," What they’re not invited?! Oh no, that’s terrible! They’re
gonna be crushed!"
59,Monica, Why would they think they’re invited?
60,Joey, (looking around) You got me. I don’t…
61,Monica, Joey!
62,Joey," Well, I’m sorry. I thought parents were coming! Y’know? Your
parents are comin’! Chandler’s parents are comin’! Ross’s parents are
comin’!"
63,Monica, Ross’s parents are my parents!
64,Joey, Well-well—see? Parents are comin’!
65,Chandler, Y’know I think we should invite them.
66,Monica," Oh please, you just want more blue pins."
67,Chandler, Well this is just sad!
68,Monica," All right, all right. Maybe I can fit them in if I just do some
rearranging. But uh, Rachel may actually have to sit at the bar!"
69,Rachel, That is not a problem.
70,Joey, (leaning down to her) Maybe you’ll order a little sangria?
71,Rachel," Oh, get out of here! (Jumps back and walks away.)"
73,Rachel," (motioning to a rack) So now, these are all the tuxedos that we make and
if there’s anything that you like, we can make you a deal. Anything at all. (Grabs a
few) But these are the three that Monica pre-approved."
74,Chandler," Well, thanks a lot for hookin’ me up Rach. I want you to know
that I want you to attend our wedding as my guest."
75,Rachel," I’m Monica’s maid of honor. Okay? Don’t try to blue pin
me!"
76,Chandler," (sees another rack) Well, what’s the deal with these? These-these
look nice."
77,Rachel," Oh they are nice. We-we custom-make tuxedos for celebrities and then
when they’re done with them they just send ‘em back."
78,Chandler, You mean like for award shows?
79,Rachel, Some of them.
80,Chandler," You mean these tuxes have been down the red carpet with people
yelling, ""You are you wearing?! You look fabulous!"""
81,Rachel," Honey, might I suggest watching a little more ESPN and a little
less E!?"
82,Chandler," Okay, who wore those? (Points to the tuxedos.)"
83,Rachel," Umm, well let’s see uh, this one is Tom Brokaw."
84,Chandler, Not bad.
85,Rachel, (reading a tag) This one is uh Paul O’Neil.
86,Chandler, Who’s that?
87,Rachel," He plays for the Yankees. Seriously, ESPN! Just once and a while,
have it on in the background. (Chandler nods and Rachel grabs another tux) Ooh, this one
was Pierce Brosnan!"
88,Chandler, Pierce Brosnan?
89,Rachel, Uh-huh.
90,Chandler, Are you serious?
91,Rachel, Yeah.
92,Chandler, 007?! This is James Bond’s tux?!
93,Rachel, Yeah.
94,Chandler," Oh, I have to get married in James Bond’s tux!"
95,Rachel, It’s a pretty cool tux.
96,Chandler," Oh, it’s not just that, I would be England’s most powerful
weapon. Jet setting heartbreaker on her majesty’s secret service. A man who fears no
one; with a license to kill. (Worried.) Would Monica let me wear this?"
98,Joey, We should really learn how to play the real way. (Moves another piece.)
99,Phoebe," I like our way. Oh! (Grabs a piece and jumps a bunch of Joey’s like
in Checkers.) Chess!"
100,Joey, Nice move.
101,Phoebe, Yeah.
102,Rachel, (entering) Hey!
103,Joey, Hey!
104,Phoebe, Hey!
105,Rachel," So Joey I just hooked Ross and Chandler up with some tuxedos for the
wedding, do you need one?"
106,Joey," No, I’m performing the ceremony. I’m not wearing a tux."
107,Rachel," Well, what are you going to wear?"
108,Joey," Multi-colored robes! Ooh, and maybe a hat."
109,Rachel, Huh. Does Monica know about this?
110,Joey, I don’t think so.
111,Rachel, Can I please be there when you tell her? (Joey nods yes.)
112,Phoebe," Hey oh, Rach wait! Do you want to go to a movie tonight?"
113,Rachel," Oh, y’know what? I can’t. I have to have dinner with that
Melissa girl."
114,Joey," (excitedly) Can I come?! I won’t even talk! You’ll just hear the
noise from my video camera."
115,Phoebe, What is this? What’s going on?
116,Joey, Oh good! Can I tell her?! Can I tell her?!
117,Rachel," Well, do you want to hear what actually happened or Joey’s lewd
version?"
118,Phoebe, Joey’s!
119,Joey, Okay…
120,Rachel," Hey, come on! I had this friend from college and I made the stupid
mistake of telling Joey that one time…she and I y’know…kissed a little bit."
121,Phoebe," (laughs) Yeah, I’m sure that happened."
122,Rachel, It-it did!
123,Phoebe, Sure!
124,Joey, Hey. (Laughs then seriously) It happened!
125,Rachel," Yeah, it was senior year in college. It was after the Sigma Chi luau and
Melissa and I got very drunk! And we ended up kissing! For several minutes! "
126,Phoebe," (To Joey) Which means she had a couple spritzers and a quick peck on the
cheek."
127,Joey, Why are you taking this away from me?
128,Rachel," Yeah, why is it so hard for you to believe?!"
129,Phoebe," Okay! I just—I didn’t know that you are a lesbian. (Joey
smiles and nods lewdly.)"
130,Rachel," I’m not saying that I’m a lesbian! I’m just saying that
this happened!"
131,Phoebe," Okay, it just seems pretty wild and you’re so—y’know
so…vanilla."
132,Rachel, (shocked) Vanilla?!
133,Phoebe, Yeah.
134,Rachel," I’m not vanilla! I’ve done lots of crazy things! I mean I
got-I got drunk and married in Vegas!"
135,Phoebe, To Ross.
136,Rachel," All right, y’know what? If you don’t want to believe me about
this, why don’t you just come with me to dinner tonight and she will tell you."
137,Phoebe, Okay! All right! Yeah! ‘Cause I just can’t picture it.
138,Joey," Oh-ho, you should get inside my head."
140,Ross, Hey! Guess what I got for your wedding! (Holding up his garment bag.)
141,Chandler, A freakish thin date with a hanger for her head?
142,Ross," No. Rachel hooked me up with a tux! But not just any tux, Batman’s
tux!"
143,Chandler, What?
144,Ross," That’s right! Made expressly for Val Kilmer and worn by him in the
hit film…that Batman film he was in."
145,Chandler," You can’t wear that! I’m wearing the famous tux! James
Bond’s tux!"
146,Ross, So?
147,Chandler, So—If you wear that you’ll make mine less special.
148,Ross," Well, you need something to make this day special? Hello! You-you-you have
the most special thing of all! You are marrying the woman you love."
150,Chandler," Please, don’t take away my cool thing. Please?! Pretty please?!"
151,Ross," Pretty please? Not very uh, 007."
152,Chandler," Look, it’s my wedding day okay? If you were getting married I
would never do anything to upset you."
153,Ross, When I got married you slept with my sister.
154,Chandler, That was pretty 007.
156,Joey, Hey.
157,Monica," Hey. Oh good-good you’re here! All right, I figured it out.
I’m gonna take two tables of eight, I’m gonna add your parents, and I’m
gonna turn them into three tables of six. Okay? And I called the caterer; I added two
extra meals, we are good to go!"
158,Joey," Yeah, they’re not coming."
159,Monica, (looking at him) What?!
160,Joey," Somehow they got the idea that you only invited them because of me.
They…feel a little unwanted."
161,Monica," Oh that’s too bad. It’s true, but too bad."
162,Joey," Look Mon, if you could just call my mom…"
163,Monica, Oh Joey!
164,Joey," Come on! Look just-just tell—let her know that you really want them
to be there. Let’s not forget, this is a woman that has sent you many lasagnas over
the years."
165,Monica, No she hasn’t.
166,Joey, Is it her fault that some of them didn’t make it to you?
167,Monica," Well, what am I going to say?"
168,Joey," I don’t know. Just uh, just tell ‘em it was a mix-up with the
invitations, or—No-no-no! Blame it on the post office. They hate the post
office. And the Irish! But I don’t think you can blame it on them so… (He dials
the phone and hands it to Monica.)"
169,Monica," (on phone) Hello? (Listens) Yeah, hi! Mrs. Tribbiani? (Listens) Hi, this
is Monica Geller. (Listens) Yeah I’m just calling to say that Chandler and I uh,
really hope you can make it to the wedding. Yeah, apparently a bunch of invitations that
we sent weren’t delivered. Umm, I guess there was some screw up at the damn post
office! (Joey nods his approval.) (Listens) T-Tell me about it! (Listens) Yeah, yeah, the
US Post Office? No, more like US lost office! (Listens) What are they Irish?! (Joey gives
her a thumbs up.)"
172,Rachel," Oh. Oh, that’s great!"
174,Phoebe," Of course! Yeah, I was uh, umm Thigh Mega Tampon."
176,Phoebe," Yeah! Y’know, we were really huge too, but then they had to shut us
down when Regina Philange died of alcohol poisoning."
178,Rachel," (changing the subject) Anyway, speaking of drinking too much. I was uh,
tellin’ Phoebe about that one crazy night after the Sigma Chi luau where you and I
uh, we made out."
180,Rachel," Remember?! We—come on both had the sarongs on, and we had the-the
coconut bikini tops…"
182,Rachel," …we went back the house and we got really silly and we…we made
out."
184,Phoebe, Really?!
187,Chandler, Ross is Batman!
188,Monica," Well, he did manage to keep his identity secret for a long time."
189,Chandler," Rachel got Ross the tuxedo that Val Kilmer wore in Batman. Okay Batman
is so much cooler than James Bond!"
190,Monica, What are you talking about?! 007 has all those gadgets!
191,Chandler, Batman has a utility belt!
192,Monica, 007 has a fancy car!
193,Chandler, Batman has the Batmobile!
194,Monica, 007 gets all the ladies.
195,Chandler, Batman has Robin! (Pause) We get ESPN right?
196,Monica," How about you go put on your 007 tuxedo and I’ll make you a nice
martini."
197,Chandler," Actually, I don’t like martinis."
198,Monica, How about a Youhoo with a funny straw?
199,Chandler," Ooh, yum! (Runs into the bedroom.)"
200,Joey, (entering) Hey.
201,Monica, Hey.
202,Joey," Listen, I know the invitation says 600, but does that mean that you want
people to get there at six, or the show is gonna start right at six?"
203,Monica, The show?!
204,Joey," Right. Right. The wedding, gotcha. But I mean, it’s gonna start a
little late right? I mean, weddings start late. Right?"
205,Monica, Have you ever been to one of my weddings?
206,Joey," Ah. Yeah. Well look, the thing is it’s the same day as my
niece’s christening and I really want my parents to be there in time to see me.
‘Cause my part’s just in the beginning I’m not even in the rest of the
show—Wedding!"
207,Monica, The wedding starts at six.
208,Joey," Okay. Okay, I totally hear ya. Oo how about this? I vamp a little
‘til they get there?"
209,Monica, You’ll vamp?!
210,Joey," Yeah! Yeah y’know, like warm up the crowd. Ask ‘em where
they’re from. ‘Cause in Joey Tribbiani you get a minister and you get an
entertainer. I’m a minis-tainer! (Rapping) There is no one better! There is no one
greater!"
212,Rachel, How can you not remember us kissing?!
214,Rachel," Wh… Come on! Remember? We were on the sleeping porch! We
couldn’t stop giggling? And our coconuts kept knockin’ together?"
215,Phoebe," Oh, somewhere Joey’s head is exploding."
216,Rachel," Yeah—but come on—Listen, I’m sorry I don’t want to
make you uncomfortable, but I told Phoebe that it happened and she doesn’t believe
me."
218,Rachel, No!!
219,Phoebe," Rachel, it’s okay. You don’t have to do this. I believe you.
All right? Okay, if-if you say that you kissed Melissa, then you kissed Melissa."
220,Rachel, Thank you Phoebe.
222,Phoebe, I know.
224,Ross, Hey!
225,Monica, You just carry that around?
226,Ross, Yes. I find it to be something of a conversation piece. 
227,Monica, Between you and…
228,Ross," Gunther. (To Chandler) Hey-hey! Why don’t we put them on? Y’know
get a picture of Batman and James Bond together."
229,Chandler, I would but mine doesn’t fit. The pants are a little tight.
230,Monica, A little tight? I could see double-oh and seven in those pants.
231,Ross," Well that stinks. I was looking forward to us wearing our celebrity tuxes
together."
232,Chandler," Well, does that mean that you’re not going to wearing yours?"
233,Ross, What are you kidding? It’s Batman’s tux!!
234,Chandler, (standing up) Let me try it on!
235,Ross," Okay, but just the jacket. Double-oh and seven are not gettin’ in
there."
236,Chandler," (trying on the jacket) Okay. Holy double-vented comfort Batman! (Finds
something in the pocket) What’s this?"
237,Ross, What?
238,Chandler," An invitation for the At First Sight premiere? Oh my God! Val
Kilmer didn’t wear this in Batman! He wore it to the premiere of some tooty-fruity
love story where he played a blind guy!"
239,Ross, Let me see that! (Grabs the invitation and reads it.) Oh man!
240,Chandler," The only superpower you have is a slightly heightened sense of smell.
(Hands him the jacket and walks away.)"
241,Joey," (entering) Hey! Uh, Monica? Chandler? Can I talk to you guys for a second?"
242,Monica," All right that’s it, I give up! Whatever you want you can have it!
You wanna sing a song? You wanna do a dance? You want your mom stand at the Alter and
scream racial slurs? I don’t care!"
243,Joey," No! No, I-I just wanna thank you guys for what you did for my parents,
that was really sweet. They’re so happy they get to be a part of your special day."
244,Monica, (defeated) Oh.
245,Chandler," Well, you’re welcome. And tell them we’re really glad
they’re coming."
246,Joey," Okay. I will. Ohh! Check out what they got me to wear for the ceremony!
(Runs to his apartment and returns wearing a rather silly hat.) Huh? I wear it like this
when I marry you guys, and then this (He tilts it to the side of his head) is for party
time."
248,Rachel, It happened! I am telling you it happened!
251,Rachel," What?! Wait a minute! No wait a minute! (She does so.) Okay? Look, that
night was the one wild thing I have ever done in my entire life, and I’m not
gonna let you take that away from me! Okay, so if you don’t remember that, maybe
you will remember this! (She grabs Melissa and kisses her on the lips.)"
253,Rachel, (shocked) What?
255,Rachel, (moving away) Whoa! Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
257,Rachel, (moves away again) I-I-I-I’m just…I’m just a good kisser!
259,Rachel, I’m sorry!
261,Rachel, Wow! I mean I had no idea that that was gonna…
263,Rachel, What the hell was that?!
264,Phoebe, I just wanted to see what all the fuss was about.
265,Rachel, And?
266,Phoebe, I’ve had better.
269,Chandler, (yelling from the changing room) All right! I found one that fits!
270,Rachel," Well y’know what they say, the 23rd time’s the
charm. (Chandler enters.) Aww, look at you all handsome!"
271,Chandler, Whose is it?
272,Rachel, Oh does it matter?! All that matters is that you look so handsome.
273,Chandler, Whose is it?
274,Rachel, I don’t want to say.
275,Chandler," Oh, come on! I don’t care! Come on! Whose is it?"
276,Rachel, Diane Keeton.
0,Monica," Do you realize that four weeks from today we’re getting married?
Four weeks baby!! Four weeks!!!"
1,Chandler, Do you realize you get louder each week?
2,Monica, There’s still so much to do. Have you written your vows yet?
3,Chandler," I figured I’d buy those. Pat, I’d like to buy a vow.
(Laughs)"
4,Monica," Sweetie, you know I have no sense of humor when it comes to the wedding."
5,Chandler," Right. So uh, have you written yours yet?"
6,Monica, No! But I know exactly what I’m going to say.
7,Chandler, Do you happen to know what I’m going to say?
8,Monica," (handing him a pad of paper and a pen) Let’s just do it right now.
Okay? It won’t be hard. Just say what’s in your heart. (She goes back, sits
down, and starts feverishly writing.)"
9,Chandler," (watching in her) (in his head) Look at her go! She must love me
more than I love her! What’s wrong with me? Ooh, don’t open that door."
12,Chandler," (writing) Monica, there are no words… (To Joey and Ross) There
are no words! This should not be this hard!"
13,Joey," All right, uh… (To Ross) Oh hey, you’ve done this before Ross,
well what did you say when you made up your vows?"
14,Ross," Well with Carol, I promised never to love another woman until the day I
die. She made no such promise."
15,Chandler," I’m so pathetic! Monica knows what she wants to say! You
should’ve seen her. Writing, writing, writing!"
17,Rachel, Monica what? 
18,Phoebe, What?!
19,Rachel, What is the emergency?!
20,Monica," You have to help me! I’m supposed to be writing my vows and all I
have is this! (Shows them what she’s been working on.)"
21,Rachel," Well, I like the pretty little drawing of you in the wedding dress."
22,Monica, Thank you.
23,Phoebe," Yeah, except your breasts look kinda small. (Points.)"
24,Monica, Those are my eyes! Those are my breasts. (Points.)
25,Phoebe, Oh! Yeah! (Monica glares at her.)
27,Ross," Well, why don’t you just start with something simple. Like umm,
Monica from the moment I met you, I knew I loved you."
28,Chandler," Yeah, I’m not sure I can do that."
30,Ross," ...everyone, this is Chandler!"
32,Chandler, (seeing her) Okay.
34,Rachel," Okay. Okay. Okay. Umm, maybe you can start with, ""Chandler, even
though we were friends; there was a part of me that always knew I wanted more."""
36,Chandler," All right, there’s a nuclear holocaust, I’m the last man on
Earth. Would you go out with me?"
37,Monica, Ennnh.
39,Monica," Ooh, are we allowed to lie in the vows?!"
40,Phoebe," Well maybe you don’t talk about your feelings back then. Maybe you
just say something about y’know all the things that he’s taught you. Like…
(They all try to think about one example and don’t succeed.) Or all the things you
taught him."
42,Monica," Now everybody knows the basic erogenous zones. (She starts labelling
them) You got one, two three, four (Chandler is shocked to find out there’s more than
three), five, six, and seven!"
43,Chandler, (shocked) There are seven?! (Points to one) That’s one?
44,Monica, It’s kind of an important one!
45,Chandler," Oh, y’know-y’know what, I was looking at it upside down."
46,Rachel," Well, y’know, sometimes that helps. (She realises what that
could’ve meant.)"
47,Monica," All right. Umm, you could uh start out with a little 1, a 2, a 1-2-3, 3,
5, a 4, a 3-2, 2, a 2-4-6, 2-4-6, 4, (Rachel starts getting worked up) 2, 2, 4-7, 5-7,
6-7, 7 …7..…7…7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7…(mouths 7)! (They both lean back
on the couch satisfied.)"
49,Joey," Oh, I got it! How about saying something like, ""Monica…"
50,Chandler, (writing) Monica…
51,Joey," ""…when I look back over our time together…"""
52,Chandler, (writes what Joey said and waits for him to go on) Yeah?
53,Joey," Well, I can’t do everything! Look back over your time together."
55,Phoebe," Oh, look, twins. Hi, guys. Oh, cute, cute."
56,Monica, No fair. I don't even have one. How come they get two?
57,Chandler, You'll get one.
58,Monica, Oh yeah? When?
59,Chandler," All right. I'll tell you what. When we're 40, if neither one of us are
married, what do you say you and I get together and have one?"
60,Monica, Why won't I be married when I'm 40?
61,Chandler," Oh, no, no. I just meant hypothetically."
62,Monica," Ok, hypothetically, why won't I be married when I'm 40?"
63,Chandler," No, no, no."
64,Monica, What is it? Is there something fundamentally unmarriable about me?
65,Chandler," (trapped) Uh, uh."
66,Monica, Well?
67,Chandler," Dear God! This parachute is a knapsack! (throws himself over the back
of the chair he was sitting in)"
69,Ross, 
70,Monica, 
72,Chandler, Nice try.
73,Monica," Wait, wait, wait! (She puts a Shriner's hat on the turkey.)"
74,Chandler," Look, Monica…"
75,Monica," Look! (She puts a big, yellow pair of sunglasses on the bird.)"
76,Chandler, This is not going to work.
77,Monica, I bet this will work! (She starts dancing and Chandler cracks up.)
78,Chandler, You are so great! I love you!
80,Monica, What?
81,Chandler," Nothing! I said, I said ""You're so great"" and then I just, I
just stopped talking!"
82,Monica, You said you loved me! I can't believe this!
83,Chandler, No I didn't!
84,Monica," Yes, you did!"
85,Chandler, No I didn't!
86,Monica, You love me!
87,Chandler, No I don't! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
90,Chandler,"  Y’know I was thinking, what if I uh, unpack here?"
91,Monica, Then all your stuff would be here.
92,Chandler," Well, what if all my stuff was here?"
93,Monica," Then you’d be going back and forth all the time, I mean it
doesn’t make any sense."
94,Chandler," Okay. What if we lived together and you understand what I’m
saying?"
97,Monica, You wanted it to be a surprise.
99,Chandler, Oh my God.
101,Monica," Chandler… In all my life… I never thought I would be so lucky.
(Starting to cry.) As to…fall in love with my best…my best… There’s a
reason why girls don’t do this!"
102,Chandler," Okay! (He joins her on one knee) Okay! Okay! I'll do it!  Oh God,
I thought… (Starting to cry, pauses) Wait a minute, I-I can do this. (Pause) I
thought that it mattered what I said or where I said it. Then I realized the only thing
that matters is that you, (Pause) you make me happier than I ever thought I could be.
(Starting to cry again.) And if you’ll let me, I will spend the rest of my life
trying to make you feel the same way. (Pause as he gets out the ring.) Monica, will you
marry me?"
103,Monica, Yes.
105,Joey, (yelling through the door) Can we come it yet?! We’re dying out here!
106,Monica," Come in! Come in! (Joey, Rachel, and Phoebe burst through the door.)
We’re engaged!!!"
110,Joey, Hey!
111,Ross, Hey!
112,Rachel, Hey!
113,Phoebe, Hey!
114,Rachel," Hey, what have you guys been up to?"
115,Ross," Oh, we were helping Chandler write his vows, but he kicked us out because
Joey kept making inappropriate suggestions."
116,Joey," How is ""Monica, I love your sweet ass,"" inappropriate?"
117,Ross, How’s Monica coming along with her vows?
118,Phoebe," Well let’s just say its she’s lucky she has a sweet ass,
‘cause she’s not so good at the writing."
119,Ross, I can’t believe in four weeks they’re gonna be married!
120,Phoebe," Well let’s just hope it works. Y’know nine out of ten
marriages end in divorce?"
121,Ross, Phoebe that’s not true.
122,Phoebe," Yeah, you’re right. How’s the Mrs.?"
123,Rachel, I can’t believe they’ve been together for three years.
124,Joey, (shocked) Has it been that long?!
125,Ross," Believe me, it seems like less because they hid it from us for so long."
128,Joey," Hey, it's me! I'm comin' in!"
130,Chandler," I've had a very long, hard day."
131,Joey," Ahh, I'm gonna go get some chicken. Want some?"
132,Chandler," Ahh, no thanks. No chicken, bye-bye then."
133,Joey, Okay.
135,Chandler," Are you okay? I'm so sorry, he wouldn't leave. He kept asking me about
chicken."
136,Monica, Chicken? I could eat some chicken.
137,Chandler, Hey Joe!
139,Chandler," Yeah, can I get a 3-piece, some cole slaw, some beans, and a Coke—(Yelps
in pain as Monica grabs him underwater)—Diet Coke."
142,Rachel, I don’t know why they didn’t just tell us.
143,Joey, I know! I mean it’s not like we weren’t cool about it.
145,Joey, (To Chandler) You?! (To Monica) And-and you?!
146,Monica," Yes, but you cannot tell anyone! No one knows!"
147,Joey, How?! When?!
148,Chandler, It happened in London.
149,Joey, IN LONDON!!!
150,Chandler," The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a
big deal out of it."
151,Joey, But it is a big deal!! I have to tell someone! 
153,Chandler, No-no-no-no-no! You can't!
154,Monica," Please? Please?! We just don't want to deal with telling everyone, okay?
Just promise you won't tell."
156,Joey," All right! Man, this is unbelievable!"
158,Monica," (on phone) I can't wait to be with you!  I'll just tell Rachel I'm
gonna be doing laundry for a couple of hours."
159,Chandler," (on phone) Laundry. Huh. Is that my new nickname? (Rachel is
absolutely stunned, she opens her mouth in absolute amazement.)"
160,Monica," (on phone) Awww, y'know what your nickname is, Mr. Big…"
161,Rachel," Arghh!! (She quickly hangs up the phone and starts to pace around
wondering what to do.)"
163,Phoebe," (looking out the window) Oh, look! There's Monica and Chandler! (Starts
yelling.) Hey! Hey, you guys! Hey! (Chandler and Monica start taking each other's clothes
off.) Ohh!! Ohh! Ahh-ahhh!!"
164,Rachel, What?!
165,Phoebe, (screaming) Ahhh!! Chandler and Monica!! Chandler and Monica!!
166,Rachel, Oh my God!
167,Phoebe, CHANDLER AND MONICA!!!!
168,Rachel, OH MY GOD!!!
169,Phoebe, OH!! MY EYES!!! MY EYES!!!!
170,Rachel, Phoebe!! Phoebe!! It's okay!! It's okay!!
171,Phoebe, NO! THEY'RE DOING IT!!!
172,Rachel, I KNOW!! I KNOW!! I KNOW!
173,Phoebe, YOU KNOW?!!!
174,Rachel," Yes, I know! And Joey knows! But Ross doesn't know so you have to stop
screaming!!"
175,Ross, (entering) What's going on?
177,Rachel," (trying to divert his attention from the window by jumping up and down)
HI!! Hi! "
178,Ross, What?! What?!
179,Rachel," Nothing! Oh God, we're just so excited that you want to get this
apartment!"
180,Ross," Actually, it looks really good. (Turns towards the window and now Phoebe
starts jumping to divert his attention.)"
181,Phoebe," (Screaming incoherently.) Get in here!!! (Motions to join her and
Rachel.)"
184,Phoebe," Okay, so now they know that you know and they don't know that Rachel
knows?"
185,Joey," Yes, but y'know what? It doesn't matter who knows what. Now, enough of us
know that we can just tell them that we know! Then all the lying and the secrets would
finally be over!"
186,Phoebe," Or, we could not tell them we know and have a little fun of our
own"
188,Rachel," All right honey, we'd better go if we wanna catch that movie."
189,Monica, Bye!
191,Phoebe," Bye Chandler! (She walks up to him.) (Quietly.) I miss you already. (She
pinches his butt.)"
192,Chandler," (after they've left) Okay, did you see that?! With the inappropriate
and the pinching!!"
193,Monica," Actually, I did!"
194,Chandler," Okay, so now do you believe that she's attracted to me?"
195,Monica," Ohhh, oh my God! Oh my God! She knows about us!"
197,Chandler, Phoebe knows about us!
198,Joey, Well I didn't tell them!
199,Monica, Them?! Who's them?
200,Joey," Uhhh, Phoebe and Joey."
201,Monica, Joey!
202,Joey, And Rachel. I would've told you but they made me promise not to tell!
203,Monica," Oh man, they think they are so slick messing with us! But see
they don't know that we know that they know! So…"
204,Chandler," Ahh yes, the messers become the messies!"
206,Phoebe," I'll have to get back to you on that. Okay, bye! (Hangs up.) Oh my God!
He wants me to come over and feel his bicep and more!"
207,Rachel, Are you kidding?!
208,Phoebe, No!
209,Rachel," I can not believe he would do that to Mon—Whoa! (She stops suddenly
and slowly turns to point at Joey. Joey is avoiding her eyes.) Joey, do they know that we
know?"
210,Joey, No.
211,Rachel, Joey!
212,Joey, They know you know.
213,Rachel," Ugh, I knew it! Oh I cannot believe those two!"
214,Phoebe," God, they thought they can mess with us! They're trying to mess with
us?! They don't know that we know they know we know! (Joey just shakes his head.) Joey,
you can't say anything!"
215,Joey, I couldn't even if I wanted too.
217,Chandler," Listen, this is totally getting out of hand! Okay? She wants me to put
lotion on her! "
218,Monica, She's bluffing!
219,Chandler," Look, she's not backing down! She went like this! (He does a little
mimic of her dance.)"
221,Phoebe, He's not backing down. He went to get lotion.
222,Joey, (entering the hall) Oh man! Aren't you guys done yet?!
223,Rachel," Joey look, just look at it this way, the sooner Phoebe breaks Chandler
the sooner this is all over and out in the open."
224,Joey, Ooh!
225,Rachel, Okay!
226,Joey," I like that! (To Phoebe) Oh, okay! Show him your bra! He's afraid of bras!
Can't work 'em! (He swiftly rips open the front of Phoebe's dress revealing her bra.)"
227,Phoebe," Joey! (Examining the dress.) Wow, you didn’t rip off any buttons."
228,Joey, It's not my first time.
230,Monica, You go back out there and you seduce her till she cracks!
231,Chandler," Okay, give me a second! (Pause) Did you clean up in here?"
232,Monica, Of course.
234,Chandler," Oh, you're-you're going?"
235,Phoebe," Umm, not without you, lover. (She slowly walks over to him and is
showcasing her bra.) So, this is my bra."
236,Chandler," (swallowing hard) It's very, very nice. Well, come here. I'm very
happy were gonna have all the sex."
237,Phoebe, You should be. I'm very bendy. (Pause) I'm gonna kiss you now.
238,Chandler, Not if I kiss you first.
240,Phoebe, Ooh.
241,Chandler," Well, I guess there's nothing left for us to do but-but kiss."
242,Phoebe, Here it comes. Our first kiss.
244,Chandler, Okay! Okay! Okay! You win! You win!! I can't have sex with ya!
245,Phoebe, And why not?!
246,Chandler, Because I'm in love with Monica!!
247,Phoebe, You're-you're what?!
249,Chandler," Love her! That's right, I…LOVE…HER!!! I love her!! (They
walk together and hug.) I love you, Monica."
250,Monica, I love you too Chandler. (They kiss.)
251,Phoebe," I just—I thought you guys were doing it, I didn't know you were in
love!"
252,Joey,  So that's it! It's over! Everybody knows!
253,Monica," Well actually, Ross doesn't."
254,Chandler," Yes, and we'd appreciate it if no one told him yet."
256,Ross," (He notices something through the window.) No! No! Wh… What are you
doing?!! (Dr. Ledbetter is slowly backing away.) GET OFF MY SISTER!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
258,Phoebe," Y’know, you’re friend’s getting married, it’s gotta
change things."
259,Rachel, You really think it would be that different?
260,Phoebe," How could it not be? I mean pretty soon they’re gonna be having
kids, and then they’re just gonna be hanging out with other couples who have kids.
And then maybe they’re gonna have to leave the city to be near a Volvo
dealership."
261,Rachel," Well, things change."
262,Joey, I don’t want them to move to a Volvo dealership!
263,Ross, It’ll be okay Joe.
264,Joey," I’m sorry, I just…I like things the way they are."
266,Rachel," Hey, who's this little naked guy?"
267,Ross, That little naked guy would be me.
268,Rachel," Aww, look at the little thing."
269,Ross," Yes, yes, fine, that is my penis. Can we be grown-ups now?"
270,Chandler, Who are those people?
271,Ross, Got me.
272,Monica," Oh, that's Nana, right there in the middle. (Reads the back) 'Me and the
gang at Java Joe's'. "
273,Rachel," Wow, Monica, you look just like your grandmother. How old was she there?"
274,Monica," Let's see, 1939... yeah, 24, 25?"
275,Ross, Looks like a fun gang. (They all look at each other and smile)
276,Joey," Ooh, look-look-look-look-look! I got Monica naked!"
277,Ross," (looking) Nono, that would be me again."
279,Monica," Hey, you guys!"
280,Phoebe, Hey.
281,Joey, Hey.
282,Chandler, What’s going on?
283,Rachel," Well, we were just talkin’ about you guys gettin’ married and
how great it is."
284,Joey," Yeah, you can get a Volvo. If that’s what you really want."
285,Monica, Oh that’s so sweet.
286,Chandler, So we both finished our vows.
287,Phoebe, Oh!
288,Joey, Hey!
289,Rachel," Oh, can we read them?"
290,Monica," Yeah, I don’t hear Chandler’s and he doesn’t hear mine."
291,Rachel, Okay.
292,Phoebe, Okay.
294,Phoebe," (To Monica) Oh, that’s beautiful."
295,Joey, (To Chandler) (laughing) Funny one! That’s good!
296,Rachel," (To Monica) Monica, will-will you marry me?"
298,Joey, What? I don’t get it.
300,Ross," (To Chandler) Oh man, this is hilarious."
301,Monica, Chandler!!
302,Chandler," Don’t worry honey, we’ll make yours funnier."
305,Chandler," Okay, what do you guys think?"
306,Ross, (quietly) Dude!
307,Joey, (starting to cry) I have never known love like this.
308,Chandler, You really like it?
309,Ross, Dude! How-how did you write this?
310,Chandler, I stole Monica’s and changed the name.
311,Ross, You can’t do that!
312,Joey, If he goes first he can!
0,Ross, Hey!
1,Monica, Hey!
2,Ross," Hey uh Mon, I saw the Porsche parked out front, can I get the keys?
Thought I’d take that bad boy out for a little spin."
3,Rachel," Wait a minute! (To Monica) You let Ross drive the Porsche and
when I ask you, you say you’re the only one who’s allowed to drive it."
4,Monica," Yeah, well he’s my brother! And plus he drives so slow he could
never hurt it."
5,Ross, It’s a car Monica! Not a rocket ship!
6,Monica," Whatever Ross! Just replace the bulbs in the brake lights after
you’re done."
7,Joey, (entering) Hey!
8,Ross, Hey!
9,Phoebe, Hey!
10,Joey," Saw the Porsche out there Mon, lookin’ good. When do I get to take
that baby out again?"
11,Rachel, (shocked) You let Joey drive it?!
12,Phoebe," I’ve never driven it! Okay? Not once! Okay once. Okay, I drive it
all the time."
13,Monica," Nice work everybody! So much for the y’know, ""You can drive
it, but don’t tell Rachel"" plan!"
14,Rachel, Wow! I can’t believe you lied to me.
15,Phoebe," Okay, I can fix this! Okay Monica, Rachel thinks all you can talk about
is the wedding. (Rachel glares at her.)"
16,Monica," Great! Well Rachel, the reason why I won’t let you drive the
Porsche is because you’re a terrible driver. There! That wasn’t about the
wedding."
17,Ross," Look Rach if-if you want to go for a ride in the Porsche I’ll be glad
to take you for a quick spin around the block."
18,Joey," Yeah, you got a couple hours?"
21,Ross, Whew! That was a brisk ride!
22,Rachel, Take the top down did ya?
23,Ross, Only way to fly.
25,Rachel," Come on Ross give me the keys! Monica does not know what
she’s talking about! I am an excellent driver!"
26,Ross, You’re fast and irresponsible. That adds up to a bad driver.
27,Rachel," Well in High School, that added up to head cheerleader."
29,Ross," Did you see the look that girl just gave me? Huh? She must’ve seen me
cruising in the bad boy."
30,Rachel, I think she’s checking out your beehive Ross.
31,Ross, What?! (Checks his hair.) Give-give me a brush.
32,Rachel, Gimme the keys!
33,Ross, No way!
34,Rachel, Well no brush!
35,Ross," Fine! Y’know what? It doesn’t matter, because, if I remember
correctly, there is a comb on the floor of the bathroom. "
37,Rachel, (to the woman) Alimony. (Runs outside.)
39,Monica," Chandler, we still haven’t gotten an RSVP from your dad."
40,Chandler," Oh! Right. Umm, maybe that’s because I didn’t send him an
invitation."
41,Monica, Chandler! He’s your father; he should be at the wedding.
42,Chandler," I don’t even know the man. Okay? We’re not the close. I
haven’t seen him in years."
43,Monica, Well what are you gonna do when he finds out he wasn’t even asked?!
44,Chandler," Well he doesn’t have to know! It’s not like we run in the
same circles. I hang out with you guys, and he stars in a drag show in Vegas."
45,Phoebe," Ooh, I think I wanna trade circles."
46,Chandler," Trust me, you don’t want him there either. Okay? Nobody is gonna
be staring at the bride when the father of the groom is wearing a back-less dress."
47,Monica," So what! As long as he’s not wearing a white dress and a veil I
don’t care."
48,Phoebe," Okay, I think I need to do some shopping. (Gets up and leaves.)"
50,Rachel," Ahhh! (Gets in.) Ooh, nice!"
52,Rachel, My God!
53,Ross, What do you think you’re doing?!
54,Rachel," Just washing the windshield. (She turns on the wipers forcing Ross off
of the hood.)"
55,Ross," There is no way I am letting you drive this car! So why don’t
you just hand over the keys?"
56,Rachel, Oh.
58,Ross," No ah-ah-ah! Do not start this car! (She starts the car.) Okay!
Okay! I will give you twenty bucks if you get out of this car right now! (He looks for the
twenty Rachel stole and doesn’t find it.)"
59,Rachel," Look Ross, if you’re so freaked out, just get in the car!"
60,Ross, With you?! Yeah right!
61,Rachel, All right. (She starts off.)
62,Ross," (grabbing the car) Okay! Okay! Okay! (He gets in, but into the back seat.)"
63,Rachel, What are you doing?! Get in the front!
64,Ross, In the death seat?!!
65,Rachel, Oh my…
69,Joey, Hey!
70,Phoebe, Hey sweetie!
72,Phoebe," Yeah! Sure! Ooh, I left my purse up at Monica’s. I’ll be right
back. (She goes to get it.)"
74,Phoebe," What? (He leans in to kiss her.) Oh. (They kiss and Phoebe pauses.) Ooh.
(Pause) Whoa! That one kept going. (Exits.)"
75,Joey, So! You and Phoebe huh? How long have you been going out?
77,Joey," Wow! Maybe uh, maybe you and I ought to get to know each other a little
better."
79,Joey," So uh, what’s your name?"
81,Joey," Joey. (They shake hands.) Hey Jake, do you like the Knicks?"
83,Joey, Me too! There’s a game on Tuesday do you wanna go?
86,Monica, Here! (She sets a bag down in front of him.)
87,Chandler, What’s this?
88,Monica, It’s your suitcase. We’re going to Las Vegas.
89,Chandler," Are you serious?! I mean like eloping?! No more stupid wedding stuff?!
No more these flowers or these flowers or these flowers—Think of the money we’ll
save!! (Monica just looks at him.) We’re not eloping. I love the flowers. Can our
wedding be bigger please?"
90,Monica," We’re going to Las Vegas to see your dad. It’s time you two
talked, and I want to get to know my father-in-law."
91,Chandler, Y’know we already went over this and I won!
92,Monica," No you didn’t. Oh and honey just so you know, now that you’re
marrying me, you don’t get to win anymore."
93,Chandler," Look forget it okay? I don’t want to go. I don’t want to see
him. I don’t wanna."
94,Monica," Chandler, look I-I know that your dad embarrassed you. I know…"
95,Chandler," No-no all kids are embarrassed by their parents, you’d
have to come up with a whole new word for what I went through. When I was in High School,
he used to come to all of my swim meets dressed as a different Hollywood starlet.
Y’know it’s hard enough to be fourteen. You’re skinny. You’re wearing
speedoes—That your mom promised that you would grow into! And you look up into the
stands and there’s your dad cheering you on dressed as Carmen Miranda. We was wearing
a headdress with real fruit that he will later hand out to your friends as a
healthy snack!"
96,Monica," Hey, the point is that he was at everyone of your swim meets and he was
there cheering you on! Okay? That’s a, that’s a pretty great dad."
97,Chandler, He had sex with Mr. Girabaldi!
98,Monica, Who’s Mr. Girabaldi?
99,Chandler, Does it matter?!
100,Monica," Chandler, you’re not fourteen anymore. Okay? Maybe it’s time
that you let that stuff go. If your father’s not at your wedding…you’re
gonna regret it for the rest of your life."
101,Chandler," Yeah o-okay, but I’m just doing this for you."
102,Monica, Yes!
103,Chandler, So I really never get to win anymore?
104,Monica, How much did ever really win before?
106,Joey, Pheebs!
107,Phoebe, Hey!
108,Joey," Listen, you know how uh, when you’re wearing pants and you lean
forward I check out your underwear?"
109,Phoebe, Yeah!
110,Joey," Well, when Jake did it I saw that…he was wearing women’s
underwear!"
111,Phoebe, I know. They were mine.
112,Joey," Oh. (Laughs.) No! No wait, that’s weird!"
113,Phoebe," No, it’s not! We were just goofing around and I dared him to try
them on."
114,Joey, That’s weird!
115,Phoebe, I’m wearing his briefs right now.
116,Joey, That’s…kinda hot.
117,Phoebe, I think so too. And that little flap? Great for holding my lipstick.
118,Joey," Yeah, I wouldn’t know about that."
119,Phoebe," And! Y’know what Jake says? That women’s underwear is actually
more comfortable. And he loves the way the silk feels against his skin."
120,Joey," Yeah well next thing you know, he’ll be telling you that your high
heels are good for his posture!"
121,Phoebe," There is nothing wrong with Jake! Okay? He is all man! I’m thinking
even more than you."
122,Joey," Oh yeah, he looked like a real lumberjack in those pink laceys."
123,Phoebe," I’m just saying that only a man completely secure with his
masculinity could walk around in women’s underwear! I don’t think you could ever
do that."
124,Joey, Hey! I am secure with my masculinity.
125,Phoebe, Okay whatever.
126,Joey, You’ve seen my huge stack of porn right? (Phoebe nods.)
128,Rachel," God. I forgot how much I love driving. I have got to get my
license renewed."
129,Ross," (shocked) You don’t have a valid driver’s
license—Okay that is it! Pull over right now!"
130,Rachel," Oh Ross you’re so tense! You just gotta relax okay? Just need to
relax all right? Just need to relax… (She takes her hands off of the wheel.)"
131,Ross," (grabbing the wheel) What-what are you doing?! Are you—Okay
that’s not funny! Just stop horsing around!"
132,Rachel, I am not horsing around okay? I am Porsching around.
134,Rachel, Uh-oh. (She starts to pull over.)
135,Ross," Okay, stay calm. Nothing is going to happen to you, you are not in that
much trouble."
136,Rachel, Really? You think so?
137,Ross, I was talking to myself! You’re going down!
141,Monica," Uh oh yeah, she did. Uh, he did. (To Chandler) She? (To the waiter)
I’m-I’m sorry I’m new. I don’t…"
143,Chandler," Yeah, I just ordered a beer! (Pounds the table.)"
145,Monica," I still say that if we had called your dad we coulda gotten better
seats."
146,Chandler," No! No! I don’t want him to know we’re yet! I’m not
sure I’m ready for that. And besides he’s not gonna be too happy to see me
either."
147,Monica, Why not?!
148,Chandler," I don’t know if I’ve told you this, but he’s kinda
tried to get in contact with me a lot over the last few years"
149,Monica, What?!
150,Chandler," Yeah, he’s made phone calls, written letters, he even came to New
York, but I always said I was too busy to see him. Y’know it’s all very Cats
in the Cradle—I don’t want to get into it. (The show starts.) Here we go."
154,Chandler, And there’s daddy!
157,Rachel," Okay. Switch places with me! Switch places with me! Come on! I’ll
go under, you go over!"
158,Ross," Yeah, I’ll get right on that."
159,Rachel," Oh come on Ross!! (She tries to switch places with him and goes under
his leg.)"
160,Ross," No Rach! Come on! No-no! Yeah, I’m sure we won’t get arrested
for this."
162,Rachel," (sexily) Hi officer, was I going a little too fast?"
163,Ross, Oh my God.
165,Rachel," Oh yes, absolutely! Y’know, it’s weird uh, but I had a dream
last night where I was stopped by a policeman. And then he uh…well I probably
shouldn’t tell you the rest."
167,Rachel," (handing it to him) Yes. Here you go Officer uh, Handsome."
169,Rachel," Oops sorry, my mistake."
170,Ross, Dear Lord!!
172,Ross, Here it comes.
174,Rachel," Really?! You think so? Y’know, I had just rolled out of bed."
176,Ross," Well she should, it was taken ten years ago!"
177,Rachel," Y’know you’re-you’re probably wondering about the old
date on there."
179,Rachel, Yeah.
181,Rachel, I bet you’re a Gemini. 
183,Rachel, Taurus?
185,Rachel, Virgo?
187,Rachel, Sagittarius?
189,Rachel," I knew it! I knew it, ahh…."
191,Rachel, Yeah?
193,Rachel, I won’t speed.
195,Rachel, I promise.
197,Rachel, Yeah!
199,Rachel, Oh well…
200,Ross, I can handle the stick!!
204,Monica, That can’t be your father.
205,Chandler," Believe me, I’ve been saying that for years. Oh my God!"
206,Monica, What?
207,Chandler, That’s Mr. Girabaldi playing the piano.
209,Chandler," He’s coming into the audience. He’s coming into the
audience."
210,Monica," Relax! You’ll be fine. (Chandler exhales and turns off the table
light.) Oh much better. You’re invisible now."
216,Chandler," It can’t happen like this. Okay? I’ll meet you back at the
hotel."
219,Monica," Can we have our drinks please?! Waiter—Uh, tress!"
221,Joey, Hey Pheebs! (He sits down next to her.)
222,Phoebe, Hey!
223,Joey," Check it out. (He turns around, pulls down his pants, and shows Phoebe
that he’s got panties on.) How much of a man am I?!"
224,Phoebe, Wow! Nice! Manly and also kind of a slut.
225,Joey," Y’know, I’m beginning to see what Jake was talking about."
226,Phoebe, Uh-huh.
227,Joey, The silk? Feels really good!
228,Phoebe, Huh.
229,Joey," Yeah! And-and things aren’t as…smashed down as I thought they
were gonna be."
230,Phoebe, That’s great Joe!
231,Joey," Yeah! And you have so many more choices than you do with
men’s underwear!"
232,Phoebe, Uh-huh.
233,Joey," Bikini, French cut, thong! And-and the fabrics! You’ve got cotton,
silk, lace! And y’know what I’ve always wondered about?"
234,Phoebe, Hmm?
235,Joey," Pantyhose! Y’know? They way they start at your toe and go all the way
up to here… (He mimed that and stops when he realized he went to far.) I should go
take these off shouldn’t I?"
236,Phoebe, I think it’s important that you do.
240,Chandler, (resigning himself to his fate) Chandler. (He quickly sits down.)
242,Chandler," Oh, they’re a hoot."
244,Monica, I’m-I’m Monica.
246,Monica, New York.
248,Chandler, Actually Monica and I are engaged.
250,Monica, (looks at Chandler) In…in two weeks.
252,Chandler, Wait! Wait! We’d really love it if you could be there.
254,Chandler," I know it would make me happy, ma’am."
256,Monica, (To Chandler) You okay?
257,Chandler, Yeah. Thanks for making me do this.
262,Chandler," (To Monica) When I was growing up I…played the one on the far
left."
264,Rachel, Remind me to introduce you to someone!
265,Ross, Who?
266,Rachel, Fourth gear!!
268,Ross, What?! What does he want?! I wasn’t doing anything!
269,Rachel," Well maybe he saw your hand slip briefly from the ten and two
o’clock position."
270,Ross," Maybe it’s uh Sergeant Sagittarius coming back to flirt some more!
(They pull over.)"
271,Rachel, It’s a different guy!
273,Ross, Good evening officer.
275,Ross," Ah no. I don’t, but it could not have been more than sixty."
277,Ross," I mean you’re not gonna give me a-a ticket for driving too slow are
ya?"
280,Ross, Y’know of-officer I uh…I had the weirdest dream last night…
281,Rachel, Oh my God!
283,Ross," (laughs) You don’t-you don’t want to hear about my dream
Officer…Pretty?"
285,Rachel, (pause) You have a son!
286,Ross, I know. I know.
289,Phoebe, Feel better?
290,Joey," Yeah! Much! Listen uh, not that I’m y’know insecure about my
manhood or anything y’know, but I think I need to hook up with a woman like right
now."
291,Phoebe," Yeah, I understand."
292,Joey," Yeah! Okay! (He notices a beautiful woman sitting behind the couch and
goes to talk to her.) Hey! Hi!"
294,Joey," Y’know, you look familiar. Do I know you from somewhere?"
296,Joey," Oh! Maybe it’s because I’m on television. I’m an actor on Days
of Our Lives."
298,Joey, Yeah.
300,Joey, Hm-mmm.
302,Joey," Oh, let me get this. (He takes out his wallet, but the panties come with
it. The woman and waitress are shocked.) (Realizing) (To the woman) These are for you."
0,Monica," Do you realize this is probably the last time we’ll all be here in
the coffee house as six single people?"
1,Phoebe," Why?! What’s happening to the coffee house?! (Monica looks at her.)
Oh! (Realizes.)"
2,Chandler," Yep! From now on its gonna be the four of you guys and me and the
misses. The little woman. The wife. The old ball and chain."
3,Monica, Old?
4,Chandler, The young hot ball and chain.
5,Monica, That’s much better.
6,Rachel, (checking her watch) Op! We gotta go! (The girls stand up.)
7,Ross," Oh, where are you guys going?"
8,Monica," We’re gonna pick up the wedding dress then we’re gonna have
lunch with mom. (Joey stands up.)"
9,Ross, Ah. Joey you’re-you’re having lunch with my mom?
10,Joey," No, I-I just heard lunch. But yeah, I can go. Sure! (They all exit.)"
11,Ross," (To Chandler) Y’know what? Actually I’m kinda glad they’re
leaving ‘cause uh, I need to talk to you about something."
12,Chandler, What’s up?
13,Ross," Well this uh, this may be a little awkward."
14,Chandler," Listen, if you want to borrow money, its kind of a bad time. I’m
buying dinner for 128 people tomorrow night."
15,Ross," No, its…Its not that. Umm, now what I’m going to say to you,
I’m not saying as your friend. Okay? I’m-I’m saying as it as
Monica’s older brother."
16,Chandler, But you’re still my friend?
17,Ross, Not for the next few minutes.
18,Chandler," During this time…are you, are you still my best man?"
19,Ross, Nope.
20,Chandler, Do I still call you Ross?
21,Ross," Okay! You guys are getting married tomorrow and-and I couldn’t be
more thrilled for both of you, but as Monica’s older brother I-I have to tell you
this. If you ever hurt my little sister, if you ever cause her any unhappiness of any
kind, I will hunt you down, and kick your ass! (Chandler laughs.) What?
I’m-I’m-I’m serious! (Chandler laughs harder.) Come—Hey! Dude! Stop
it! Okay? I’m-I’m not kidding here!"
22,Chandler," (smiling) Hey, I hear what your saying, okay? And, thanks for the
warning."
23,Ross, No problem.
24,Chandler, So are we…friends again?
25,Ross, Yeah.
26,Chandler," Okay. (Pause) You won’t believe what Monica’s older
brother just said to me!"
29,Rachel, What ‘cha doing Mon?
30,Monica," I’m making a list of all the things that are most likely to go
wrong at the wedding. Now, that way I can be prepared."
31,Phoebe, What are they?
32,Monica," Well, so far I have uh, my bride’s maids dresses won’t get
picked up, my veil gets lost, or I don’t have my something blue."
33,Rachel, Hey! Those are all the things I’m responsible for!
34,Monica, I had to go with the odds Rach.
35,Joey," (entering) Hey! You guys! Remember that audition I had a while ago and
didn’t get the part?"
36,Rachel, The commercial?
37,Joey, No!
38,Phoebe, That play?
39,Joey, No!
40,Monica, That other play?
41,Joey, Nooo!
42,Phoebe, The movie?
43,Joey, Yes!!
44,Phoebe, Ohh!
45,Joey, Yes that’s the one about the soldiers who fight in World War I!
46,Phoebe," Oh, yeah! Back then y’know, we called the Great War. It really was!"
47,Joey," Well anyway, the guy they wanted backed out and now they want me! I start
shooting today!"
48,Phoebe, Congratulations!
49,Rachel, Oh that’s great!
50,Monica," Wait! Wait! Wait! You can’t start today! Today’s the rehearsal
dinner!"
51,Joey," Oh no, I’ll be done by then."
52,Monica, Oh. Well then way to go you big movie star!
53,Joey," I know! All right, I’ll see you guys over there! I’m off to
fight the Nazis."
54,Rachel," Oh, wait Joey! We fought the Nazis in World War II, not World War I."
55,Joey," Whoa! Okay. Yeah well, who-who was in World War I? (Rachel pauses as she
thinks.)"
56,Phoebe, Go ahead.
57,Rachel, You’re gonna be late! Go! Go! (He runs out.)
58,Monica, Who did we fight in World War I?
59,Rachel, Mexico?
60,Phoebe, Yes! Very good.
63,Joey, Yeah! Me too. (He pats his pocket.)
65,Joey, I’m doing my scenes with you?
67,Joey," Wow! I can’t believe this! This is incredible. I mean you just won an
Oscar!"
69,Joey, I think you did.
71,Joey, Uh…Cookie?
75,Joey, We have to find the rest of the platoon!
77,Joey, (wiping his face) What?!
79,Joey," (wipes face) So what are we gonna do?! We have no reinforcements! No-no
food!"
83,Joey," (glances at Richard) No. Nope, I uh…I th—I thought it might be
kind of a cool character thing. Y’know? He’s uh, he’s a face toucher.
(Behind his back, Richard is nodding no.)"
87,Monica," Honey, we gotta go!"
88,Chandler," (entering from the bedroom) Okay. Here’s a question you never
have to ask. My dad just called and wanted to know if he could borrow one of your pearl
necklaces."
89,Monica," (laughs) I don’t have anything like that, but let me go see if
Rachel does."
90,Chandler," Yes, include more people in this."
91,Monica," Hey, do you realize that at this time tomorrow we’ll be getting
married?"
92,Chandler, Wait a minute! I have a date tomorrow night.
93,Monica," I just, I can’t believe that we made it!"
94,Chandler, Well you don’t have to sound so surprised.
95,Monica, I’m sorry but…nothing.
96,Chandler, What?
97,Monica," Well…honestly ever since we got engaged I have been waiting for
something to, to flip you out."
98,Chandler, Honestly? Me too.
99,Monica, Really?
100,Chandler," Yeah. Y’know I keep thinking that something stupid is gonna come
up and I’ll go all…Chandler. But nothing has."
101,Monica," Ohh, I’m so glad. Thank you so much for staying so calm during
this. I mean it’s really, it’s made me stay calm. (Chandler just looks at her.)
I coulda been worse!"
102,Chandler, Okay. I’ll be right there.
104,Monica," (voice on answering machine) Hi! If you’re calling before Saturday,
you’ve reached Monica and Chandler. But if you’re calling after Saturday,
you’ve reached Mr. and Mrs. Bing! Please leave a message for the Bings!"
107,Monica," Hey Maureen! (They hug.) Gosh! Hey uh, Chandler? This is my cousin
Maureen."
108,Chandler, We’re the Bings.
110,Rachel, Hi! Oh you guys look so beautiful!
111,Chandler, Mr. and Mrs. Bing! (Walks away.)
112,Ross," (walks up) Wow Monica! Hey, just so you know I had my uh, older brother
chat with Chandler."
113,Monica, What is that?
114,Ross," Well I…I told him that if he ever hurt you I would hunt him down and
kick his ass! (The girls all laugh.) What?! What?! What is the matter with everybody?! I
am serious! I would kick his ass! (The laugh harder.)"
115,Phoebe," Ross, please! My make-up! (He walks away angrily.)"
117,Chandler, Hi.
119,Chandler," Mom. Thanks for wearing something. (They hug.) (She’s wearing a
tight dress with a lot of cleavage showing.)"
122,Monica," Mrs. Bing? Here, these are my parents umm, Judy and Jack Geller."
127,Monica," Dad! There’s Ross (points), why don’t you go talk to him?"
131,Chandler, Hi…dad.
132,Monica, Hi Mr.…Bing.
135,Monica, It-it’s so great to see you both here.
138,Chandler, Oh my God! (He and Monica walk away.)
142,Ross, Thanks you guys. (Walks away happily and his parents smile.)
144,Monica," Oh, Rach! Rach! Umm hey, could you do me a favor and would talk to
Chandler’s dad and try to keep him away from Chandler’s mom?"
145,Rachel, Yeah! But I don’t know what he looks like!
146,Monica, He is the man in the black dress.
147,Rachel," Man in the black dress… (Monica walks away and Rachel looks around
to find a woman in a black dress.) (To her) Hi! I’m Rachel! I’m a friend of
Monica and Chandler’s!"
149,Rachel, Oh I get it! A…man…duh!
150,Ross," (clinking a wine glass) Can I have everyone’s attention please?
I’m uh; I’m Ross Geller."
152,Ross," Dad…dad, please! As I was saying umm, I’m Dr. Ross Geller. Uhh,
and I’m the best man. And uh, this marriage is doubly special for me umm, because not
only is the groom my best friend but uh, the bride is my little sister. And, she’s
the greatest sister a guy could ask for. So if you’d all please join me in raising a
glass to the, the couple we’re here to celebrate. (Everyone does so.) To the Bings."
156,Monica," All right, I’m gonna go steam my wedding dress okay? Who wants the
responsibility of making sure nothing happens to it?"
157,Rachel, I’ll do it.
158,Monica, Who wants it? Anybody?
159,Rachel, I said I’ll do it!
160,Monica," Nobody wants to do it? All right, I’ll do it myself."
161,Rachel, Monica! I’m not gonna screw it up!
162,Monica," Y’know what? You’re right, I’m sorry. Actually you were a
big help tonight. Yeah, and thanks for putting my grandmother in the cab and making sure
she got to the hotel safely."
163,Rachel, Well of course that is what I’m here for!
164,Monica, Okay. Sorry. (Monica goes into the bathroom.)
165,Rachel, Ugh! (To Phoebe) What grandmother?
167,Joey, Hey! Where have you been?
168,Ross," Oh, taking my parents back to the hotel."
169,Joey, Oh.
170,Ross, What? Are you going back to work?
171,Joey, Yeah.
172,Ross, Nice shades.
173,Joey," Thanks. Yeah, I figure if I wear these in my scenes at least I won’t
get spit in the eyes, y’know?"
174,Ross," And if I remember correctly, Ray Ban was the official sponsor of
World War I!"
175,Joey, Great! All right. I’ll see you later. (He starts to leave.)
176,Ross," Hey, where’s Chandler?"
177,Joey," Uh, I think he’s in Rachel’s room. See ya. (Exits.)"
178,Ross," (going up to Rachel’s closed door) Chandler? (He opens the door and
looks inside and doesn’t see him.) Chandler? (He checks the bathroom and still
doesn’t find him. He then finds a note on the counter. He picks it up and reads it.)"
180,Ross, Hey! 
181,Rachel, Hi!
182,Ross," Is uh, is Monica here?"
183,Rachel," She’s steaming her dress, why? What’s up?"
184,Ross, I think Chandler’s gone. (He hands her the note.)
185,Rachel, What?!
186,Ross, He left that.
187,Rachel, (reading the note) Tell Monica I’m sorry.
188,Phoebe," (walking up) What’s up? (Rachel hands her the note and she reads
it.) Tell Monica I’m sorry. (Pause) Tell her yourself!"
191,Phoebe, Oh my God! Chandler just left though!
192,Rachel," Yeah but, maybe it’s not what we think. Maybe it’s tell Monica
I’m sorry I…drank the last of the milk."
193,Phoebe," Or maybe he-he was writing to tell her that-that he’s changed his
name, y’know? Tell Monica I’m sorry."
194,Ross, I think it means he freaked out and left!
195,Phoebe," Don’t be so negative! Good God! Isn’t it possible that Sorry
is sitting in there (Joey and Rachel’s apartment) right now?!"
196,Rachel," Okay. Phoebe, I-I think Ross is right. What are we gonna do?"
197,Ross," Look—Okay, I’m just gonna—I’m gonna have to go find
him and bring him back! Okay? You-you make sure Monica does not find out, okay?"
198,Rachel, Okay.
199,Phoebe," (pointing at Ross) Okay but if you don’t find him and bring
him back, I am gonna hunt you down and kick your ass!"
201,Ross," (scared) I will, I will find him."
204,Joey, Oh man! They-they just redid my make-up!
206,Joey, All right.
210,Joey, Picture? What picture?
212,Joey," Okay uh, look I know you’re a great actor, okay? And you play all
those Shakespeare guys and stuff…"
214,Joey, But you’re spittin’ all over me man!
216,Joey, You know you’ve been spitting on me?!
218,Joey, (wiping face) Wow! Didn’t know that.
220,Joey," Thanks! Okay-okay check it out! (Reading from the script) Picture? What
picture? (He pauses then spits) Eh?"
222,Ross," Gunther have you uh, have you seen Chandler?"
224,Ross, Oh damn!
226,Ross," Yes. Yes. Don’t worry. Everything’s fine. We’ll uh,
we’ll see you tomorrow at the wedding."
228,Ross," Well then we’ll-we’ll see you the day after tomorrow. (Walks
away slowly, but notices something.) Mom?! Dad?! (They’re sitting by the window.)
What-what…what you guys doing here?!"
231,Ross, Why?!
233,Ross, (shocked) Gunther?!
235,Ross, What? Your-your list?
237,Ross," Yes! No-no! I know, I know what the list is! Mom! Look if you see
Chandler, could you just let him know I’m looking for him?"
243,Joey, What picture?!
245,Joey, You went through my personal property?
247,Joey," (pause) Because Vincent, we were lovers. (Pause) For two years!"
250,Joey, Great scene yeah?
252,Joey, Thanks a lot.
254,Joey," Oh, I’m-I’m not working tomorrow."
256,Joey," No! No! I can’t! You gotta get me out of it! I’ve got plans!
(Spits.) Important plans! (Spits on the Ps.)"
259,Rachel, (closing the door) Ross said there’s still no word from Chandler.
260,Phoebe, Oh man.
261,Rachel," Oh but he did say that they found the grandmother wandering down fifth
avenue."
262,Phoebe, Okay. Well there’s one down.
263,Monica," (entering from her room, excitedly) I’m getting married today!!!
(She trips and falls.) (Getting up) I think I just cracked a rib. But I don’t care
because today’s my wedding day! My day is finally here!! (Runs back into her room.)"
264,Phoebe, Y’know she might not even notice he’s gone.
265,Monica," (re-entering) I’m gonna start getting ready! (Goes back into her
room.)"
266,Rachel," God! Don’t—We can’t let her start getting ready! This is
too awful! Oh God, but wait she’ll be in the gown and then he won’t show up and
then she’s gonna have to take off the gown…"
267,Phoebe," Shhh! Stop it! Stop it Rachel! You can’t do this here! (She drags
her into the bathroom.)"
268,Rachel," I’m sorry. I’m sorry. It’s just…It’s just so
sad!"
269,Phoebe," Yeah, but you’ve got to pull yourself together! Monica can’t
see you like this! Then she’ll know something’s wrong!"
270,Rachel," I know. I know. Oh God. (Looking around) There’s no tissue! Can you
grab me some toilet paper?"
271,Phoebe," Yeah. (Looks.) Oh, that’s gone too. This is Monica’s
bathroom right?!"
272,Rachel, Oh!
273,Phoebe, No-no! I-I…I found one.
274,Rachel, Okay.
276,Rachel," Oh thank you! (Wiping her nose.) Oh God! (She throws it out.) Can I have
another one?"
277,Phoebe," (looking into the trash can) Sure. (Reaching into the trash can.) Do you
need some floss? (Grabs a piece of it.)"
278,Rachel," Oh God I just can not imagine what is gonna happen if Chandler
doesn’t show up!"
279,Phoebe, Oh here’s a whole bunch.
280,Rachel," Oh, I mean she’s gonna be at the wedding waiting for him and people
will be whispering, ""Oh that poor girl."" Y’know? Then she’ll have to
come back here and live all alone."
281,Phoebe, (finding something interesting in the trash can) Oh my God!
282,Rachel, What?
283,Phoebe," There was a pregnancy test in the garbage, and it’s positive.
Monica’s pregnant. (Rachel covers her mouth.) So I guess she won’t be totally
alone."
286,Rachel, Oh my God!
287,Phoebe," I know! Monica’s gonna have a baby! Hey, can this count as her
something new?"
288,Rachel, Oh my God!
289,Phoebe," Hey, do you think this is why Chandler took off?"
290,Rachel," No, she had to have just taken that test because I took out the trash
last night."
291,Phoebe," Oh God, this is turning into the worst wedding day ever! The bride is
pregnant. The groom is missing. And I’m still holding this. (She throws the test back
into the trash.)"
292,Rachel," Okay Phoebe, we can not tell anyone about this."
293,Phoebe, Right.
294,Rachel, Okay?
295,Phoebe," Yeah, okay. Hey, wait. Do you know what kind of birth control she was
using?"
296,Rachel, No. Why?
297,Phoebe," Just for the future, this is hardly a commercial for it."
299,Rachel, Anything?
300,Ross," No! I talked to Joey on the set, he hasn’t heard from him. I-I-I
talked to Chandler’s parents again!"
301,Phoebe, You told them he was missing?
302,Ross," No! I made it seem like I was just calling to chat. Pretty sure, they both
think I’m interested in them."
303,Rachel," All right, we’ve got to tell her he’s gone. (Starts to leave.)"
304,Ross, No! Hey! Hey! We can’t!
305,Rachel," Ross, she’s gonna start getting ready soon!"
306,Ross," Well, can’t you at least stall her a little? I’ll-I’ll go
back to some of the places I went last night."
307,Rachel," All right, well how much time do you need?"
308,Ross, Well how much time before she absolutely has to start getting ready?
309,Rachel, One hour.
310,Ross, Give me two.
311,Rachel, Then why do you ask?!
313,Ross," Okay, wish me luck."
314,Phoebe, Okay. I’m going with you.
315,Ross, Why?!
316,Phoebe," Ross, you’re tired. You’ve been looking all night. And clearly
you suck at this."
317,Rachel," All right, I’ll see you guys later."
318,Phoebe," Okay. Wait, do you know how you’re going to stall her?"
319,Rachel, I’ll figure something out.
320,Phoebe, All right. Good luck.
321,Rachel, Thanks.
323,Monica," Hey! Okay, so I thought we’d start with my make up and then do my
hair."
324,Rachel," Okay uh, but before you do that. I-I, I need you to talk to me."
325,Monica, About what?
326,Rachel, Umm… I’m never gonna getting married!
327,Monica," Yeah you will! The right guy is just around the corner! Okay, are we
done with that?"
328,Rachel," No Monica! I’m serious! Oh, maybe I should just forget about it.
Become a lesbian or something."
329,Monica, Any woman would be lucky to have ya.
330,Rachel, Well maybe it would make me feel better if I slept with Joey.
331,Monica, (jumping up) Rachel! You okay?
333,Joey," Excuse me, Aaron? (The director turns around.) Hi! Umm, I have a little
problem with the schedules. Originally, I wasn’t supposed to work today, and I have
this wedding that I really have to be at. It’s my best friend’s, and I’m
officiating so I really can’t work past four."
335,Joey, I’m having surgery!
337,Joey," Yeah, I-I just made up the stuff about the wedding because I didn’t
want you to worry about me. But, I’m having surgery today."
339,Joey, Transplant.
341,Joey, Hair transplant.
343,Joey, It’s not on my head.
345,Joey," Hey! You’re here! Great! Great! Great! Let’s get going buddy,
we’ve got a scene to shoot!"
347,Joey, Are you drunk?
349,Joey, Yes you are!
352,Ross, We are never gonna find him! He’s one guy in a huge city!
353,Phoebe, Oh my God! Is that him? (She points at someone.)
354,Ross," That is an old, Chinese woman!"
355,Phoebe," He could be in disguise, y’know."
356,Ross," Aw, y’know…Y’know, maybe we’re-we’re just
approaching this all wrong. If you’re Chandler and-and you wanna hide, where is the
last place on Earth people would think you’d go?"
358,Ross, So this is your office?
359,Chandler, How did you guys find me? I knew I should’ve hid at the gym!
360,Phoebe, What the hell are you doing?!
361,Chandler," Panicking! And using the Internet to try to prove that I’m
related to Monica. How is she?"
362,Ross," She’s fine. She doesn’t know you’re gone. And she
doesn’t have to know, okay? Now come on, we’re going home."
363,Chandler, No! No! No! I can’t do that!
364,Phoebe, Why not?!
365,Chandler," Because if I go home, we’re gonna become the Bings! I can’t
be the Bings!"
366,Ross, What’s wrong with being the Bings?
367,Chandler," The Bings have horrible marriages! They yell. They fight. And they use
the pool boy as a pawn in their sexual games!"
368,Ross," Chandler, have you ever put on a black cocktail dress and asked me up to
your hotel room?"
369,Chandler, No.
370,Ross, Then you are neither of your parents!
371,Chandler," It’s not just their marriage! I mean, look at yours. Look at
everybody’s! The only person that can make marriage work is Paul Newman! And
I’ve met me; I am not Paul Newman. I don’t race cars! I don’t make popcorn!
None of my proceeds go to charity."
372,Phoebe," But look Chandler, right now, no one has a lower opinion of you than I
do. But I totally believe you can do this."
373,Chandler," I want to. I love her so much, but I’m afr…It’s too
huge."
374,Ross," Y’know, okay. You’re right. It is huge. So why don’t we
take it just a little bit at a time? Okay? Umm, forget getting married for a sec; just
forget about it. Can you just come home and take a shower?"
375,Chandler," Well yeah, but then…"
376,Ross," (interrupting him) Yeah—No-but-but-but-but! We’re just gonna go
home and take a shower. Now, that’s not scary right?"
377,Chandler, Depends on what you mean by we.
379,Rachel," The nights are the hardest. (Checks her watch.) But then the day comes!
And that’s every bit as hard as the night. And then the night comes again…"
380,Monica," (interrupting) The days and nights are hard! I get it! Okay? Look umm,
Rachel I’m sorry! I have to start getting ready! I’m getting married today!"
381,Rachel, I know. At dusk. That’s such a hard time for me.
382,Monica," (getting up) I’m gonna go put my make up on, we have to be at the
hotel in an hour! (Starts for the bathroom.)"
383,Rachel, Okay. But wait!
384,Monica, What?!
385,Rachel, Let’s go to lunch.
386,Monica, I can’t go to lunch!!
387,Rachel, Right.
389,Rachel, Oh good God! I’ve fallen down! (She trips and falls.)
390,Monica, (entering) What’s going on?
391,Rachel," Okay. All right. (Gets up.) Honey listen. When I tell you what I’m
about to tell you, I need you to remember that we are all here for you and that we love
you."
392,Monica," Okay, you’re-you’re really freaking me out."
393,Rachel," We can’t find Chandler…(Phoebe sticks her head and motions
that they found Chandler)—‘s vest. We can’t find Chandler’s vest."
394,Monica," How can that be?! Oh wait! Wait! Are you, are you serious?!"
395,Phoebe," (entering) Found the vest! I mean we’re gonna have to keep an eye
on it, y’know make sure we don’t lose it again…"
396,Rachel, Oh!
397,Monica," Oh wow! Okay. Don’t scare me like that okay? I mean for a minute
there I was like, ""Oh my God! The worst has happened!"" "
400,Joey, I would sooner die in this hellhole then see her back with you!
404,Joey, What?! He got me! Owwwwww!!!
407,Joey," Look, my best friends are getting married in like an hour. Okay? And
I’m the minister. Please! Please! Can you pull it together?"
409,Joey, Thank you. Thank you.
411,Joey, I would sooner die in this hellhole then see her back with you!
414,Phoebe, So-so you two were married huh? What happened? You just drift apart?
418,Phoebe, Oh my God Monica!
419,Monica, I wanna wear this everyday.
420,Rachel, You look so beautiful.
421,Monica, (starting to cry) I’m so happy for me.
423,Rachel, Hello?
424,Joey, (on phone) Hey! Did Chandler show up yet?
425,Rachel," Yeah, we got him back. Everything’s fine."
426,Joey, Damnit!
427,Rachel, What? Why? Where are you?
428,Joey, I’m still on the set!
429,Rachel, Joey! The wedding is in less than an hour!
430,Joey," I know! I’m sorry! The guy’s drunk, they won’t let me go
until we get this."
431,Rachel, Oh my God! I’m gonna have to find another minister.
432,Joey," No! No, I’m the minister! All right, look-look, put ‘em both on
the phone, I’ll marry them right now."
433,Rachel," Ugh! Joey, I have to go."
434,Joey," Hey! Don’t you hang up on me! I’ll marry you and me right now! I
have the power!"
437,Ross," There you go. You put on a tuxedo! Now that wasn’t so scary, was it?"
438,Chandler, No.
439,Ross," I’m telling you, just a little bit at a time."
440,Chandler," Yeah okay. Well, what’s the next little bit?"
441,Ross," Getting married. (Chandler panics.) Okay. Okay. You can, you can do that
too! Just like you’ve done everything else!"
442,Chandler, Yeah. You’re right. Hey I-I can do that.
443,Ross, Yeah.
444,Chandler," Okay, excuse me for a minute. (Starts to leave)"
445,Ross," Wh—Hey—Whoa-whoa, where, where you going?!"
446,Chandler," Ross, I am not gonna run away again! I just want to get a little fresh
air."
447,Ross, Okay.
448,Chandler, Okay.
450,Chandler, Oh fresh air!
452,Phoebe," (To Rachel) Wait! Maybe, maybe you’re overreacting! You do that
y’know."
453,Rachel," Well Phoebe, we gotta do something! (They turn the corner.) Well,
y’know. I mean there’s no way Joey’s gonna make it in time. So I’m
gonna through the hotel and see if there’s any other weddings going on."
454,Phoebe," Okay. Oh but don’t tell them Monica’s pregnant because, they
frown on that."
455,Rachel, Okay.
456,Phoebe, Okay.
460,Rachel," Anastassakis/Papasifakis wedding, excellent! {It’s a good thing
Jennifer Aniston is Greek, because she had to pronounce those names. Luckily for me, they
were written on a sign.}(The happy couple emerges.) Congratulations. (To the best man and
maid of honor) Mazel Tov! (The rabbi emerges.) Hi! Oh, great hat. (He’s wearing an
interesting hat and she takes him over to talk.) Listen umm, I need you to perform another
wedding. Can you do that?"
462,Rachel," Yeah! Yeah. They’re…they’re-they’re my friends, uh,
Monica Stephanopolus and uh, and Chandler Acidofolus."
464,Ross," Hi! (To Mrs. Bing) Hi! (Mr. Bing starts rubbing his arm.) Hi. Has umm,
anyone seen Chandler?"
466,Ross," He-he was with me umm, we’re playing a little game, y’know? Hide
and seek."
468,Ross," (pause) You’re right, thanks for keeping me honest dad."
474,Ross, Oh my God! Monica!
475,Monica," I know! Hey, how’s Chandler doin’?"
476,Ross, Great. He’s doing great. Don’t you worry about Chandler.
477,Monica, Are you okay?
478,Ross, Uh-huh.
479,Monica," Well, you’re-you’re sweating."
480,Ross, These-these are beads of joy.
481,Monica, Oh that’s sweet. Don’t touch me.
482,Ross," Uh Phoebe, can I see you for a second?"
483,Phoebe, Yeah!
485,Phoebe, What’s going on?
486,Ross, Chandler’s gone again!
487,Phoebe," Oh my God! Why would you play hide and seek with someone you know is a
flight risk?!"
490,Joey, Aaron! You gotta let me go. The guy’s hammered!
494,Joey," So I uh, I just talked to the director. That’s it, we’re done
for the day."
496,Joey, Yeah! You…you were wonderful.
498,Joey," So I got your car, it’s right outside."
500,Joey, That’s what you told me.
502,Joey," No-no-no! We gotta go! Come on! (Joey picks him up in a fireman’s
carry and carries him out.) Here we go."
506,Ross, (turning a corner) There he is!!
507,Chandler, What?
509,Phoebe, Hey! Oh!
510,Ross," You’re not getting away this time mister! Unless you want that ass
kicking we talked about!"
511,Chandler, Ross! (He starts to get up.)
512,Ross," Hiiii-Ya!! (Chandler lies back down.) I’m serious! You’re not
walking out on my sister!"
513,Chandler, (standing up) That’s right! I’m not!
514,Ross, Then where the hell have you been?!
515,Chandler, I know about Monica.
516,Phoebe, You know?!
517,Ross, What?
518,Chandler," Yeah, I heard you and Rachel talking."
519,Ross, What?! What?! Talking about what?!
520,Chandler, You don’t know?
521,Ross," Know what—If somebody doesn’t tell me what’s going on right
now…"
522,Phoebe, What? You’ll hi-ya?
523,Chandler, Monica’s pregnant.
524,Ross," Oh my God. Oh my God! And you’re-you’re…you’re not
freaking out?"
525,Chandler," Well I was! Then I went down to the gift shop because I was out of
cigarettes…"
527,Chandler," Big picture please! So I was in the gift shop, and that’s when I
uh, saw this. (He holds up a little, tiny baby jumper that reads I (heart) New York.)
Yeah, y’know what? I thought anything that can fit into this, can’t be scary."
528,Phoebe, Well you obviously didn’t see Chucky 3.
529,Chandler," But come on, look at how cute and small this is! So I got it to give
Monica so she’d know I was okay."
530,Ross, Dude. (Hugs him.)
536,Chandler," You look beautiful mom. (His dad clears his throat.) You look
beautiful too dad. I love you both. (He kisses his dad on the cheek) I’m so glad you
here. (He kisses his mom.)"
539,Chandler, Are you Joey?
541,Ross, Huh. This is nice.
542,Phoebe, What?
543,Ross," I’ve never walked down the aisle knowing it can’t end in
divorce."
546,Monica, She’s right there.
550,Chandler, You look beautiful. Is this new? (Her dress.)
551,Monica, Not now.
552,Chandler, Okay.
554,Monica, (To Chandler) Who is this?
556,Chandler, (in Monica’s ear) He’s Greek Orthodox.
557,Rachel, (leaning in) As are you…
559,Joey," (entering) That’s my line! (He walks up the aisle and to the rabbi) I
can take it from here, thanks. (To all) Dearly beloved, I’m sorry I’m a little
late. You may be confused by this now, (He’s still in costume) but you won’t be
Memorial Day weekend 2002. Well, let’s get started before the groom takes off again.
Huh? (Monica is shocked and looks around.) We are gathered here today, to join this man
and this woman in the bonds of holy matrimony. I’ve known Monica and Chandler for a
long time, and I can not imagine two people more perfect for each other. And now,
as I’ve left my notes in my dressing room. We shall proceed to the vows. Monica?"
561,Monica, (To Rachel) He took off?
562,Rachel, Go on! Go on. (She turns back to Chandler.)
563,Monica," Chandler, for so long I…I wondered if I would ever find my prince,
my soul mate. Then three years ago, at another wedding I turned to a friend for comfort.
And in stead, I found everything that I’d ever been looking for my whole life. And
now…here we are…with our future before us…and I only want to spend it with
you, my prince, my soul mate, my friend. Unless you don’t want to. You go!"
564,Joey, Chandler?
566,Chandler," (To Ross) No, that’s okay. (Ross nods and retreats.) Monica I
thought this was going to be the most difficult thing I ever gonna had to do. But when I
saw you walking down that aisle I realized how simple it was. I love you. Any surprises
that come our way it’s okay, because I will always love you. You are the person I was
meant to spend the rest of my life with. You wanna know if I’m sure? (He leans in and
kisses her.)"
567,Joey," You may not kiss the bride. So, I guess by the powers vested in my by the
state of New York and the Internet guys, I now pronounce you husband and wife. Oh wait! Do
you take each other?"
568,Chandler, I do.
569,Monica, I do.
570,Joey, Yeah you do!
571,Ross, Rings?
572,Joey, Aw crap! Okay—uh…uh let’s-let’s do the rings. 
574,Joey," We good? Yeah? Good? Once again, I pronounce you husband and wife. (To
Chandler) Now kiss her again."
576,Chandler, (To Monica) I love you. And I know about the baby.
577,Monica, What baby?
578,Chandler, Our baby.
579,Monica, We have a baby?
580,Chandler, Phoebe found your pregnancy test in the trash.
581,Monica, I didn’t take a pregnancy test.
582,Chandler, Then…who did?
584,Phoebe, Oh and they’re gonna have a baby.
585,Rachel, Uh-huh.
1,Monica, Okay.
2,Ross," (To Monica) Okay, I know I’m not supposed to know, but I do. And
I’m so excited for you!"
3,Joey, What? What’s going on?
4,Ross, Monica’s pregnant!
5,Joey, Oh my God! Is that why you guys had to get married?!
6,Monica, Guys! I’m not pregnant.
7,Joey, Ah. (To Chandler) Slow swimmers? (Chandler looks at him.)
8,Ross, What?! What do you mean? You-you-you’re not pregnant?
9,Monica, You didn’t tell anybody I was did you?!
10,Ross, No! (Pause) I’ll be right back. (Exits.)
12,Monica," (To Joey) Oh, about that. Joey, you have to change before the party."
13,Joey, I can’t! I-I don’t have any other clothes here.
14,Monica," Find some! Please! Anything that doesn’t say I-I died tragically in
France. (Joey leaves to find clothes.)"
16,Phoebe," Okay. (Phoebe and Rachel join Monica and Chandler on the altar.) Hey
Mon, why did you tell the guys you weren’t pregnant?"
17,Monica, Because I’m not.
18,Phoebe," We found your test in the trash, if you’re not pregnant—(She
sees Rachel shaking her head)—It’s because I am."
20,Chandler, What?! What are you talking about?
21,Monica, What are you talking about?
22,Phoebe," Yes, I…I am with child. (Flash) And I didn’t want to say
anything because it’s your day; I didn’t want to steal your thunder."
23,Monica," Wait a minute! So you told people I was pregnant?! (Flash) Does this
look like a conversation that I want to remember?!"
24,Chandler, Who’s the father?
25,Monica, Yeah!
26,Phoebe, I can’t say.
27,Monica, Why?!
28,Chandler, Why not?
29,Phoebe, I can’t say because he’s famous.
30,Rachel," Oh my God, who is it?! (Phoebe rolls her eyes.)"
31,Monica," Phoebe, come on, you have to tell us."
32,Phoebe," Okay, okay. It’s James Brolin. James Brolin is the father of my
baby."
33,Chandler, As in Barbara Streisand’s husband James Brolin?
34,Phoebe, What?! Well he never said that to me!
38,Phoebe, How about just the bridemaids?
39,Chandler, Y’know I am the groom right? I was told it was kinda big deal.
40,Phoebe, It is.
41,Rachel, For you. (Chandler leaves.)
42,Phoebe, Oh my God!
43,Rachel," Oh, thank you for doing that. I just can’t deal with this just
quite yet."
44,Phoebe, So instead you told me Monica was pregnant.
45,Rachel," You said that she was, I just didn’t disagree with you."
46,Phoebe, Sneaky.
47,Rachel, Oh yeah.
49,Rachel, Oh! (They smile and the picture is taken.) Oh by the way?
50,Phoebe, Uh-hmm.
51,Rachel, James Brolin?
52,Phoebe," Oh, I know. I could only think of two names, him and Ed Begley Jr. and
then I remembered he’s gay."
53,Rachel, Ed Begley Jr. is not gay.
54,Phoebe, (intrigued) Really?!
58,Chandler, Before we go out there I’ve got a present for ya.
59,Monica," Honey, I’m going to put my hand in your pocket!"
60,Chandler, No?
61,Monica, No.
62,Chandler, I’ve been taking dancing lessons.
63,Monica, What?!
64,Chandler," Yeah, the last six weeks. I wanted this to be a moment you will never
forget."
65,Monica, Oh that is so sweet!
66,Chandler, So? Would you care to join me in our first dance as husband and wife?
67,Monica, Yes.
69,Monica, What’s the matter?
70,Chandler," I don’t know, it’s these new shoes, they’re all
slippery."
71,Monica," Well, are you going to be able to do this?"
72,Chandler, Not well.
74,Monica," Well, the good news is, I don’t think anyone’s looking at us."
76,Phoebe," So, are you ready to talk about it?"
77,Rachel, No.
79,Phoebe, Now?
80,Rachel, No!
81,Phoebe," Okay, we’ll talk about something else then."
82,Rachel, Thank you.
83,Phoebe, Who’s the father?!
84,Rachel," Ugh! Look honey y’know what? I haven’t told him yet, so until
I do I don’t think I should tell anybody else."
85,Phoebe, Yeah. That’s fine. That’s fair. Is it Tag?
86,Rachel, Phoebe!!
87,Phoebe," Okay, I’m sorry. I’ll stop."
88,Rachel, Okay.
89,Phoebe," Is it Ross? It’s Ross isn’t it—Oh my God, it’s Joey!"
90,Rachel," Honey, stop it! I am not going to tell you until I tell him."
91,Phoebe, Ah-hah! At least we know it’s a him.
93,Monica, (seeing him) Oh sweet Lord.
94,Joey," I’m sorry! Okay? I went down to the gift shop and it’s either
this or a bathrobe! Look, what’s more important, the way I’m dressed or me being
with you on your special day?"
95,Monica," Honey, I’m not even going to pretend I was listening. (Sees someone
else.) Hey! Hey! (Goes over to that person.)"
97,Ross," Hi. I’m uh, I’m Ross. I don’t, I don’t believe
we’ve met. I’m Monica’s older brother."
99,Ross," Oh! Hello uh, Mona from her restaurant. (He uses his card to mouth those
words.) (Pause) Mona, wow what a, what a beautiful name."
101,Ross," Aw come on, Mona Lisa?"
103,Ross," Mona umm…Clickclocken. The famous botanist? Huh? Oh no she’s
uh—well she’s dead now. No, supposedly she was once quite the hottie of the
plant world."
105,Ross," Linda Clickclocken. (Pause) So what uh, what-what table are you at? (She
shows him.) Oh, uh me too."
107,Ross," (sexily) Yes there will. (Mona leaves and Ross tries to find the same
table.) Oh guess what, Molly Gilbert you’ve just been bumped up to table one. And if
it’s all right with you I’m gonna take your place at table six—Martin
Clickclocken."
109,Joey," That’s better, now just bend your arms a little more. There you go.
Okay, look straight ahead. Now this time I want you to really put your ass into it. (They
do a practice swing and she really puts her ass into it.)"
113,Chandler, Thank you.
115,Chandler, Bravo Dennis thanks for pleasing my mother so.
118,Joey," I don’t believe we’ve met, Joey Tribbiani."
120,Joey," Wow, I’ve admired your work for years. You-you’ve done some
really amazing stuff."
122,Joey, Wow Dennis Phillips! That’s great! How did you guys meet?
124,Chandler, Funny ha-ha or funny (Mimes blowing his brain out.)
128,Ross," Hey! Uh, I thought, I thought you were at table six."
130,Ross," Oh see, before you uh, when you showed it to me you-you held it that way
(he turns her hand upside down) which uh, which was misleading. Well I’m… (He
goes at sits down at his new table and the kids stare at him.) Hello."
132,Joey," Chandler. Will you see if your mom can give my resume to Dennis Phillips?
‘Cause if I can get in a Broadway show then I would’ve done it all, film,
television, and theater. The only think left would be radio, and that’s just for ugly
people."
133,Chandler, What size shoes do you wear?
134,Joey," Uh, eleven, eleven and a half."
135,Chandler," Great, because my shoes are giving me a little problem on the dance
floor, can I borrow the boots from your costume?"
136,Joey," Uh, I don’t even really know where I left those. Sorry."
137,Chandler, (looking at Joey’s feet) Those aren’t eleven and a half.
138,Joey," Okay fine! I’m a seven! All right, I have surprisingly small feet.
But the rest of me is good, I’ll show ya!"
140,Monica, Can you believe Phoebe got pregnant?!
141,Rachel, Oh y’know what honey? Let’s not talk about that right now?
142,Monica, This is so huge.
143,Rachel," Sure, but come on, as big as your wedding?"
144,Monica, Of course not nothing is. Between me and you…
145,Rachel, Yeah.
146,Monica, …in this day and age how dumb do you have to be to get pregnant?
147,Rachel," Hey! Y’know, sometimes you can do everything right, everyone can
wear everything they’re supposed to wear, and one of those little guys just gets
through!"
148,Monica, How?
149,Rachel, I don’t know! Maybe they have tools.
150,Monica," Well I-I talked to and uh, she’s definitely going to have this
baby. Y’know, she said she was gonna raise it on her own."
151,Rachel," Well, maybe that’s, maybe that’s really brave."
152,Monica, Maybe. I just hope she realizes how hard it’s gonna be.
153,Rachel, Maybe she hasn’t really thought it through that well.
154,Monica," Well, there’s a lot to think about. I mean, how is she, how is she
going to handle this financially? How is she going to juggle work? Does she realize
she’s not going to have a date again for the next eighteen years?"
155,Rachel, (starting to cry) I don’t know.
156,Monica, Are you okay?
157,Rachel, Uh-hmm. I’m just thinking about Phoebe; poor knocked up Phoebe.
159,Rachel," Oh yes! Thank you very much! (She grabs a glass, takes a sip, and
realizes what she just did. She then tries to spit the champagne back into the glass
without Monica noticing. It doesn’t work.) Oh that’s-that’s actually how
the French drink it."
163,Phoebe," Well, I just got off the phone with my lover, James Brolin…"
164,Monica, Oh really?!
165,Phoebe," Yes, and apparently he is married to some singer, but he said he would
leave her for me. And I said, ""James, James Brolin, are you sure?"" James Brolin
said…"
166,Monica, (interrupting) Rachel’s really the one who’s pregnant.
167,Phoebe, (shocked) What?! (deadpan) Why bother?
168,Monica, How do you feel?
169,Rachel," I don’t know. I don’t know how I feel. This is all happening
so fast. I have to make all these decisions that I don’t want to make. (Takes another
sip of champagne and spits it back out) Somebody just take this away from me!!"
170,Phoebe, Calm down. Maybe you’re not pregnant.
171,Rachel, What?!
172,Phoebe," When I got pregnant with the triplets, I took that test like three times
just to make sure."
173,Monica," Yes! Maybe it’s a false positive. Are you sure you peed on the
stick right?"
174,Rachel, How many ways are there to do that?
175,Phoebe," I’m-I’m just saying, don’t freak out until you’re a
hundred percent sure."
176,Rachel," All right, I’ll-I’ll take it again when I get home."
177,Monica," You-you gotta take it now. Come on, do it as a present to me."
178,Rachel, Okay. Thank you.
179,Monica, Okay.
180,Phoebe, I’ll run out and get you one.
181,Rachel," Oh, you guys are so great."
182,Monica," Oh, wait a minute! Who’s is the father?!"
183,Phoebe," Oh no, she won’t tell us."
184,Monica," Oh, come on it’s my wedding! That can be my present."
185,Rachel," Wh—Hey, I just gave you peeing on a stick."
186,Phoebe, See? This is why you register.
188,Ross," It was the chair again! Okay? I’m not doing it! It what—look, I
don’t—y’know what—eh-eh… (He walks away and goes over to Mona.)
Hi."
190,Ross," Umm, would you like to dance?"
192,Ross, Yeah?
194,Ross, Oh great! (They get up to dance and Ross is interrupted by a little girl.)
196,Ross," I wasn’t farting! (To Mona) Uh, a little game from our table. (To the
little girl) Yes?"
198,Ross," Oh umm, well uh, maybe-maybe later. Right now, I’m about to dance
with this lady. "
201,Ross," Uh, unless! Unless, uh this lady wouldn’t mind letting you go first."
203,Ross," Yes I-I am. In fact umm hey, why don’t we try it my special way? You
can dance on my feet."
205,Ross," Yeah? Hop on. (They start dancing and Mona sits down.) Is the pretty lady
looking?"
207,Ross, Keep dancing.
209,Chandler, And the world will never know.
210,Joey, Hey! Did you talk to Dennis about me yet?
211,Chandler," Yes, I told him how talented you were. I told him all about Days Of
Our Lives."
212,Joey," No-no! No! No! You don’t tell a Broadway guy that! Now he just thinks
I’m a soap actor."
213,Chandler," But you’re not just a soap actor. You are a soap actor
with freakishly tiny feet."
214,Joey, Hey!
217,Ross," No-no, thank you Miranda."
219,Ross, All right. (Walks over to Mona.)
221,Ross," Oh-oh, were you, were you watching?"
224,Ross, What? Of course you can! Hop on!
226,Ross, I am so gonna score.
228,Ross, I like your bow.
230,Joey," (clinks his glass) I’d like to propose a toast. To Monica and
Chandler, the greatest couple in the world. And my best friends. Now, my when I first
found out they were getting married I was, I was a little angry. I was like, (overly
angry) ""Why God? Why? How can you take them away from me?!"" But then I thought
back over all our memories together, some happy memories. (Does a fake laugh.) And-and
there was some sad memories. (Starts to break down and cry.) I’m sorry. And-and some
scared memories—Whoa! (He jumps back, startled.) Eh? And then, and then I realized
I’ll always be their friend, their friend who can speak in many dialects and has
training in stage combat and is willing to do partial nudity. (Starts to walk away, but
realizes something.) Oh! To the happy couple!"
233,Ross, (to the second girl) That was very nice Ashley.
235,Ross, No-no. (Walks over to Mona again.) 
239,Ross, Oh! (Recoils in horror.)
241,Ross," Oh, you-you sure? (She nods yes.) Okay. (To the girl) Okay. So what’s
uh, what’s your name."
243,Ross," That’s, that’s pretty. (They start to dance and Gert tries to
step on Ross’s feet, but he pulls them out of harm’s way.) Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
What are you doing there Gert?"
245,Ross, Okay. (Swallows hard.) Hop on Gert. (She does and Ross winces in pain.)
247,Ross, I’m trying. (He strains to move his feet.)
249,Ross," Maybe I should stand on your feet! (Gert’s shocked and Ross realizes
what he said and tries to brush it off.)"
251,Joey," So did you uh, happen to catch my toast up there?"
253,Joey," Well, I’d like to think there was something for everyone. Look, I
know you’re casting for this new show…"
255,Joey," Oh, see that’s where you’re wrong. Whatever it is I can do it.
And if didn’t see it up there, just-just try me."
257,Joey," Well I’m not proud of this, but… (He turns around and starts to
mess with his eyelids.)"
260,Monica," Hey, are you ready to get back on the dance floor?"
261,Chandler, Did it turn into sand?
262,Monica," Ohh come on, I love this song! Come on, you’ll be fine. (She starts
to walk towards the floor.)"
263,Chandler," (sliding up behind her) No. No, I won’t. Do you know why I took
all those lessons? See, for the first time I didn’t want you to be embarrassed to be
seen on the dance floor with some clumsy idiot."
264,Monica," Oh sweetie, you can never embarrass me. (Chandler grunts.) Okay, you can
easily embarrass me. But come on, it doesn’t matter. All right? I married you! So I
want to dance on my wedding night with my husband. Come on. (They go onto the floor.) Just
try not to move your feet at all. (Chandler starts to get into the groove and bust a
move.) There you go."
267,Chandler, Why?
270,Rachel, How much longer?
271,Phoebe, 30 seconds.
272,Rachel," 30 seconds, okay."
273,Monica," (entering) Did I miss it? (Phoebe nods no.) Rachel, I-I want you to know
that, if it’s positive, we’re gonna…"
274,Rachel, Oh I know. I know. (They hug.)
275,Phoebe, It’s time.
278,Monica, Go ahead Rach.
280,Rachel," Oh wait! Y’know what? I can’t, I can’t look at it. I
can’t. Somebody else tell me, somebody tell me."
281,Phoebe, Okay.
282,Rachel, Okay.
283,Phoebe," Umm, it’s negative."
284,Rachel, What?
285,Phoebe, It’s negative.
286,Rachel," Oh. Oh. Well there you go. Whew! (Pause) That is—that’s
great—that is really great-great news. (Pause) Y’know ‘cause the whole not
being ready and kinda the financial aspects, all that. Whew. Wow, this is so just the way
it was supposed to be. (Starts to cry.) God."
287,Monica," Well… Well, great."
288,Phoebe, Here. (Gives Rachel a tissue.)
289,Rachel," Thanks. (Crying) God this is so stupid! (Pause) How could I be upset
over something I never had? It’s negative?"
290,Phoebe," No, it’s positive."
291,Rachel, What?!
292,Phoebe," It’s-it’s not negative, it’s positive."
293,Rachel, Are you sure?
294,Phoebe," Well yeah, I lied before."
295,Rachel, Oh!
296,Monica, Oh God…
297,Phoebe, Now you know how you really feel about it.
298,Rachel," Oh-oh, that’s a risky little game!"
299,Monica, Are you really gonna do this?
300,Rachel," Yeah. I’m gonna have a baby. I’m gonna have a baby. I’m
gonna have a baby! (They all hug.)"
301,Phoebe, With who?
302,Rachel," Ah, it’s still not the time."
306,Ross, I just didn’t see the fast song coming.
307,Joey," Shh. Shh. Don’t try to talk, we’ll get you up to your room,
we’ll soak your feet, you’ll be okay."
308,Ross," Oh, thank you."
310,Joey, Yeah.
312,Joey," Tell me about it, I feel like I’m holding down the fort all by
myself."
314,Joey, Yeah.
315,Ross," Wait a minute! No! I’m the nice one! I’m the one who danced with
the kids all night! How…How small are your feet?! (They all look down.)"
0,Rachel," Listen y’know what sir? For the last time, I don’t care what
the computer says, we did not take a bag of Mashuga nuts from the mini-bar and we did not
watch Dr. Do-Me-A-Little!"
1,Joey, (entering) Hey!
2,Phoebe," Oh! Joey uh, were you in our room last night?"
3,Joey," No. (Phoebe grabs the receipt and shows it to Joey who gets mad.) I was
told the name of the movie would not appear on the bill!"
5,Chandler," (to the front desk clerk) Hi! We’re checking out of the bridal
suite."
6,Monica," (depressed) That’s right. I’m no longer a bride. I’ll
never be a bride again. Now, I’m just someone’s wife!"
7,Chandler," And I’m the happiest guy in the world! (Monica goes and sits down
in a huff.) Oh honey, come on don’t be upset. We still have so much to look forward
to!"
8,Monica," Oh yeah, right. (Rolls her eyes.)"
9,Chandler, We got the honeymoon.
10,Monica, That’s not ‘til Thursday.
11,Chandler, The wedding pictures?
12,Monica, They won’t be ready for weeks.
13,Chandler, Not the disposable cameras from the tables.
14,Monica, That’s true! (Happily) I knew I married you for a reason!
15,Chandler," I’ll tell you what, I will go get them developed and you can go
home."
16,Monica, Okay.
18,Chandler, What? What did you take a picture of?
19,Joey, Nothing! It was something.
20,Chandler," Okay Ross has the cameras, has he checked out yet?"
21,Rachel," Are you joking? Check out is not ‘til noon and he has a good
(checks her watch) eleven minutes left."
22,Chandler, Oh.
23,Monica, Ross has never checked out of a room a minute before he had to.
24,Rachel," Yeah, one time, when we were dating, uh we got a late checkout, he got
so excited it was the best sex we ever had. Until y’know, he screamed out Radisson
at the end."
25,Chandler," Okay, well I’m gonna get Ross, get the cameras, and get them
developed. (Joey laughs again.) 32 Joe. You’re 32! (Exits)"
27,Monica," Oh thanks. (Reading the bill) Champagne, strawberries…Oh my God! I
can’t believe Chandler ordered porn on our wedding night!"
28,Joey," Yeah, that’s sad. Mashuga nut?"
31,Ross, Hi.
32,Chandler," Hey. (He sees that Ross is packing all of the hotel toiletries) Soaps?
Shampoos? Are you really taking all this stuff?"
33,Ross, Why not? It’s built into the price of the room.
34,Chandler," Yeah but you don’t need—(Picks up something)—What is
this?"
35,Ross, Thread!
36,Chandler, Score! Where are the disposable cameras?
37,Ross, What disposable cameras?
38,Chandler, The cameras? Remember last night I told you to take them?
39,Ross, No you didn’t.
40,Chandler," Yes! Remember? Right before we cut the cake, I went up to you and I
said…"
41,Ross," Oh-oh yeah, you-you came up to me and asked if I could do you a favor, and
my Uncle Murray came up to you and handed you a check. And then you said, ""Why do
they call it a check? Why not a Yugoslavian?"" (Chandler laughs.) Yeah, then you did
that."
42,Chandler, So you don’t have the cameras?!
43,Ross, No. Sorry man.
44,Chandler, So? What? What? They’re gone! Monica’s gonna freak!
45,Ross," Well, I’m sure they’re still somewhere here in the hotel.
I’ll-I’ll help you look for them."
46,Chandler, Great.
47,Ross, In-in three minutes.
50,Phoebe, Hey!
51,Monica, Hey!
52,Phoebe, Are you gonna open the presents without Chandler?
53,Monica," No! (Pause) But, they’re callin’ out to me! I mean this little
guy (Holds up a small one) even crawled up into my lap. Oh come on, Chandler wouldn’t
mind if I opened just one present! What do you think it is?"
54,Phoebe," A little mirror that when you look into it you see yourself as an old
woman."
56,Monica, A tiny salt shaker!!!
57,Phoebe, Ohhh! My God! For tiny salt!
58,Monica, Oh wow! Okay. Well that was fun.
59,Phoebe, Oh yeah.
60,Monica," Good. Okay, I’m just gonna wait for Chandler to open the rest of
them."
61,Phoebe, Okay.
62,Monica," Whew. Although y’know, this is part of a salt and pepper set. I
mean… I guess y’know it may just count as a half a present. What do you think?"
63,Phoebe," Well I guess it’s okay to open one more if it’s part of a set.
Y’know, it’s probably this one. (Grabs another small one.)"
64,Monica, Or this one! (She grabs and starts to open the biggest present.)
65,Rachel, (entering) Hi.
66,Monica," Hey, how are you feelin’? Any morning sickness?"
67,Rachel, Shh-shh-shh! The guys don’t know yet do they?
68,Monica," No! Joey and Ross don’t know anything and Chandler still thinks
that Phoebe’s pregnant."
69,Phoebe," Yeah that’s right Chandler does still think I’m pregnant. He
hasn’t asked me how I’m feeling or offered to carry my bags. Boy, I feel bad for
the woman who ends up with him. (Monica looks at her.) After you of course."
70,Rachel," Don’t worry I promise that you will only have to be pregnant for a
few more hours, ‘cause I’m going to tell the father today."
71,Phoebe," Ooh, is it someone in this building? Is it that tall guy from the first
floor?"
72,Rachel, Ew! No!
73,Phoebe, What?! I think he’s cute.
74,Rachel, Well then you have his baby.
75,Phoebe, Believe me I’m trying.
76,Monica," Wow. Y’know it is so weird. I mean, you’re gonna tell this guy
today and he has no idea what’s gonna happen."
77,Phoebe," Yeah. You’re just gonna knock on his door and change his life
forever. You’re like Ed McMahon except without the big check, or the raw sexual
magnetism."
78,Rachel," Yeah. Uh-huh, I guess it is pretty big news."
79,Phoebe," Pretty big? It’s huge! God, this guy doesn’t have a clue!
He’s just walking down the street thinking, ‘I had sex with Rachel Green. I
rock!’ then bam! He’s a father and everything’s different."
80,Rachel," Well it’s only different if he wants it to be. I mean, I’m not
gonna ask him for anything."
81,Phoebe," Okay. Then he still has this huge decision to make. Now he’s
walking around thinking, ‘Do I want to be a dad?’ and then bam!"
82,Monica, What was that bam?
83,Phoebe, I don’t. He got…he-he-he-he’s hit by a bus.
84,Joey, (entering) Hey!
85,Rachel," Hey Joey, what would you do if someone that you slept with told you that
she was pregnant?"
86,Joey," (warily) Who called here? Did she sound blond? Huh? Did-did-did she have
an accent? I gotta make a call! (Starts to leave) I shoulda never walked into that
Sunglass Hut!"
87,Rachel," Oh Joey! Joey! No, it’s not you! You didn’t get anybody
pregnant!"
88,Joey," Oh. Why would you scare me like that? What the hell is going on? (Pause.)
Is somebody pregnant?"
89,Phoebe, Oh yeah. That’s me.
90,Joey, Oh my God Pheebs! You’re gonna have a baby?
91,Phoebe," Yes. Yes I am. Oh my God, I’m gonna have a baby! (Joey and Phoebe
hug.)"
92,Joey," Whoa, wait a minute. Who’s the father?"
93,Phoebe," You don’t know him. It’s not important. He wants nothing to do
with me or the baby. (She sits down like she’s pregnant.)"
94,Joey," Well who is this guy?! Huh? Who is he? ‘Cause I will track him down
and kick his ass!"
95,Phoebe, David Lynn.
96,Joey, David Lynn! David Lynn! David Lynn!! (Exits)
97,Monica, Who’s David Lynn?
98,Phoebe, Oh some guy from my gym. A little annoying.
100,Ross, Chandler?
101,Chandler, Hey! Did you find the cameras?
102,Ross, No. Did you?
103,Chandler, Yes! And that’s why I’m under the table. Celebrating.
104,Ross," Well I checked in the uh, lost and found, I talked to the manager,
no-one’s turned them."
105,Chandler," Well this is great. Y’know, those cameras were the only thing
that was gonna cheer Monica up today, she’s really depressed."
106,Ross," Now you guys just got married, why is she so depressed?"
107,Chandler," All my energy is going into not asking that question. I can’t
believe I screwed this up!"
108,Ross," I’m sorry man. (Formally dressed people start to enter.) Here’s
a thought. This is the same ballroom. There’s a band. There’s gonna be plenty of
dressed up people."
109,Chandler, Are you suggesting we dance our troubles away?
110,Ross," No-no-no, I’m saying we-we buy more of this (disposable cameras) at
the gift shop, throw our tuxes back on, and take a few pictures. All we have to do is make
sure not to get anybody else’s faces."
111,Chandler, Are you serious?
112,Ross," I’m just thinking about your new bride at home. Okay? Do-do you
really want to start your life together by letting her down?"
113,Chandler, Marriage advice? Really?!
114,Ross," I’m telling you, this looks exactly like your wedding! Aren’t
these the same flowers?"
115,Chandler," I don’t know, Monica picked out the flowers."
116,Ross, What about the chairs?
117,Chandler, She picked those out too.
118,Ross, How about the place settings?
119,Chandler, That was her.
120,Ross, What did you do?
121,Chandler, I was in charge of the cameras! Gift shop?
122,Ross, Hmm. (They head off to the gift shop.)
124,Phoebe," Hey! Ooh, did you do it yet?"
125,Rachel, Not yet.
126,Phoebe," Oh, well what are you doing here? Are you about to do it? (Gasps) Is it
Gunther?"
127,Rachel," No! Phoebe, it’s not Gunther."
128,Phoebe," Thank God, ‘cause that hair on a baby…"
129,Rachel," Phoebe the father is not here okay? I haven’t told him yet and I
don’t think I can tell him at all now!"
130,Phoebe, Why not?
131,Rachel," I don’t know, let me think. I was walking down the street thinking,
‘I’m gonna tell the father today’ and then bam!"
132,Phoebe, Bus?
133,Rachel," No, you! Phoebe you freaked me out. You kept saying how huge this all
is!"
134,Phoebe, Well-well but it is huge.
135,Rachel," I know, but I was just thinking about how huge this is for me. I
didn’t even go to how huge this was going to be for the father."
136,Phoebe," You’re thinking about this way too much. Just tell him and get it
over with. It’s like, it’s like ripping off this Band-Aid. (On her arm) Quick
and painless, watch. (Rips it off.) Oh mother of…See?"
138,Joey, (entering) Ooh-ooh-ooh! Are we opening presents?
139,Monica," No! No! I shouldn’t have even opened these! I mean I—Joey I am
out of control!! Joey, you have to do me a favor. No matter what I say, no matter what I
do, please do not let me open another present! Okay?"
140,Joey, Okay.
141,Monica, Give me one more.
142,Joey, Okay. (Hands her one.)
143,Phoebe, (entering) Hey.
144,Joey," Oh good, uh you’re here. Uh Pheebs? Listen uh sit down. I-I got
something I want to say. "
145,Phoebe, All right. (She sits down like she’s pregnant again.)
146,Joey," Umm, now uh… It’s a scary world out there, especially for a
single mom. Y’know, now I always thought you and I had a special bond so… (He
goes to one knee and pulls out a ring.) Phoebe Buffay, will you marry me?"
147,Monica, Oh my God! Joey!
148,Phoebe, Hell yeah! I’ll marry you! (She grabs the ring and puts it on.)
149,Monica, You can’t marry him!
150,Phoebe," Hey lady, your day’s over! It’s my turn!"
151,Monica, Phoebe!
152,Joey, Why?! Why can’t she marry me?!
153,Phoebe, I can and I will! (Kisses him.)
154,Monica," She’s not pregnant. It’s Rachel. Rachel’s the one
who’s pregnant."
155,Joey, Oh my God.
156,Phoebe, Hey!
157,Monica," Phoebe I think he would notice if you didn’t have a baby in nine
months!"
158,Phoebe," It’s Joey! (Joey turns and looks at her and she mouths ‘I love
you’ to him.)"
159,Joey," (smiles then stops) Now I can’t believe it! What? Rachel’s
pregnant? (The girls nod yes.) Who’s the father?"
160,Phoebe, We don’t know.
161,Joey, Ohh… I wonder if that dude.
162,Monica, There’s a dude?
163,Joey, Yeah.
164,Phoebe, Who? Who is it?
165,Joey," About a month ago this guy spent the night with Rachel, I didn’t see
who it was but… (He walks out and closes the door.)"
166,Phoebe, Was that story over? 
168,Joey, The guy left this.
169,Phoebe," (gasps) Oh my God! I know who the father is… (She walks into Monica
and Chandler’s.)"
170,Monica, People have got to finish their stories!
173,Chandler," (to another couple) Uh, excuse me? Could you take a picture of us?"
176,Chandler, Uhh… Yeah sure. (Holds the camera up to his face.) Click!
178,Ross, I heard it. I heard it.
181,Chandler," Oh yeah. I’ll take, I’ll take your picture. (He takes the
picture with his finger over the lens.)"
183,Chandler, Who are you? Ansel Adams?! Get outta here!
185,Phoebe," Look, I feel really bad about how I freaked you out before, so I called
the father and asked him to meet you here so you can tell him. Go!"
186,Rachel," What? Hey wait a minute! Phoebe, how do you even know who the father is?"
187,Phoebe," I may play the fool at times, but I’m a little more than a pretty
blond girl with an ass that won’t quit. (She takes the sweater out of her purse.) I
believe this belongs to the father of your baby."
188,Rachel," Oh God… Oh, he’s in there right now?"
189,Phoebe," Uh-huh. Now you can turn around or you can go in there and rip the
Band-Aid off. What to you want to do?"
190,Rachel," Uh, let’s rip!"
191,Phoebe, Really? Are you sure?
192,Rachel, Oh Phoebe!
193,Phoebe," Okay, sorry. Yeah. (They go inside to confront the father.)"
196,Chandler," Why don’t you go up on stage. I’ll get a picture of you
doing the speech."
197,Ross, Okay. Okay! 
199,Ross," Will the owner of a 1995 Buick LeSabre please see the front desk? Your car
is about to be towed."
201,Ross, A ’95 LeSabre?!
203,Ross, A green LeSabre?
205,Ross," I’m sorry, I meant a blue LeSabre."
207,Ross, Well go! Go move it! (He runs off.)
208,Chandler," Okay, you ready for the last picture?"
209,Ross, Yeah.
210,Chandler," Get ready to run. (Chandler walks over to the new bride.)
Congratulations on your wedding. (He grabs her, kisses her, Ross takes the picture, and
they both run out.)"
213,Phoebe," Rachel has something that she wants to tell you and umm, I believe that
this is your red sweater."
215,Phoebe," Oh no. Could I get anyone a coffee or…poison? No? Just for me?
Okay. (Walks away.)"
217,Rachel," Nothing! Phoebe kinda made a mistake. But y’know you do wear that
sweater a lot, are you involved in some kind of dare?"
219,Rachel," Oh, it’s just not the right time."
221,Rachel, Okay.
223,Rachel, Tag…
225,Rachel, I’m having a baby.
228,Rachel, You can go.
231,Monica," (throwing up the last present) I don’t know how any of these got
opened?!"
232,Joey, (entering) You opened them all?
233,Monica," I know! I know! I am a terrible person! I mean, Chandler is never going
to trust me with anything ever again!"
234,Joey, Oh hey! You got my parent’s gift! (Holds it up.)
235,Monica, Yeah. What is that?
236,Joey," Well, I don’t know. I think it does something to salami."
238,Monica, Hey! How’d it go?
239,Joey, Yeah. What-what did Tag say?
240,Rachel, Tag is not the father! And Joey knows now?
241,Joey," I do Rach. I do, and I so happy for you. (They hug.)"
242,Rachel," Oh wow, you didn’t even try to unhook my bra!"
243,Monica, So are you ever gonna tell whoever it is?
244,Rachel," No, I will. I’m just not up for it tonight."
245,Joey," Hey Rach listen, no matter what this guy says I want you to know
you’re not gonna be alone in this."
246,Rachel, I’m not?
247,Joey," Listen I uh… (He takes her hand.) It’s a scary world out there
especially if you’re a single mom. Y’know, I always felt like you and I have
this-this special bond. Y’know? So, (gets down on one knee again) Rachel Green will
you marry me?"
248,Rachel, What?
249,Monica, What?!
250,Phoebe, What?!!
251,Joey," Pheebs, give me the ring back!"
252,Phoebe, No!!
253,Rachel," No! Joey, oh you’re so sweet. You’re so-so sweet, honey. But
I’m not, I’m not looking for a husband."
254,Joey, (heartbroken) I understand.
255,Rachel," Now, if you will excuse me I am going to go and lie down. (Exits.)"
256,Phoebe," I can’t say that didn’t hurt. But I’ll take you back Joey
Tribbiani."
257,Joey," Uh yeah. Pheebs, listen about that. I only offered…"
258,Phoebe, Ooh! A Salami Buddy!
259,Joey, There you go!
261,Chandler, We’re back!
262,Monica," Great! We’re hangin’ in the kitchen! (She drags him into the
kitchen and turns his back to the living room) Let’s stay in the kitchen!"
263,Chandler, It’s picture time.
264,Ross, Now you are going to love these.
265,Chandler," (showing her the pictures) Here’s a picture of Ross. (Shows
another one.) And that’s me. (Another one.) And that’s me and Ross.
(Another one.) Oh-ho, that is a picture of our first kiss as a married couple."
266,Monica, Wow! That is a great picture!
267,Chandler, Eh?
268,Monica," Yeah! Oh and interesting because I found the cameras in one of our bags!
(Throws them into his chest.)"
269,Ross," Huh, didn’t see that coming."
270,Chandler," Okay, so this isn’t a picture of our first, but it is a picture
of my first kiss with…with this lady. Which by the look on your face I’m sure
you’ll remember. So we don’t need—(Rips the picture)—There’s no
need to have this picture. How about I take the real pictures and get them developed right
now."
271,Monica, That would be a good idea.
272,Chandler," Okay. (Sees the living room.) You opened all the presents without me?!
I thought we were supposed to do that together!"
273,Monica, You kissed another woman!
274,Chandler, Call it even?!
275,Monica, Okay! (They high-five and he walks out.)
276,Ross," Well, I’m gonna go get these (the floral bouquet he walked in with)
in some water."
277,Phoebe, Wait you stole those from these people’s wedding?
278,Ross," No-no, I took them from the hotel lobby. Yeah, they think they can charge
me for some dirty movie and a bag of Mashuga nuts, they got another think coming. (Starts
to leave.) Hey! My sweater! I’ve been looking for this for like a month!"
281,Joey, (slow on the uptake) Oh my God!
284,Ross, Hey! How you doing?
286,Ross, Yeah.
288,Ross," Oh hey, right back at ya."
290,Ross," Yeah. She—Well, she’s one crazy lady?"
292,Ross," (shows Tag his sweater tag) Umm, I don’t some Italian guy. Come on,
read your own label. See you later."
295,Ross, He is so weird.
0,Chandler, Hey! Babe! Aren’t you excited we’re going on our honeymoon?
1,Monica, Yeah I am!
2,Chandler," (singing) Bermuda, Bahama, come on pretty mama…"
3,Monica, That’s right. Get it out of your system while we’re alone.
4,Joey, (entering with Phoebe) Hey!
5,Phoebe, Yeah! Have a great honeymoon!
6,Chandler, I’d better go pack.
7,Monica," Oh no, I already packed. The only thing I couldn’t find though was
your Speedo."
9,Chandler," A Speedo? Uh, I don’t have a Speedo. I’m gonna go pack my
regular long bathing suit. (Goes into the bedroom.)"
10,Rachel, (entering) Oh good you’re still here!
11,Monica, Hey!
12,Rachel, I want to tell you to have a good honeymoon! (Hugs Monica.)
13,Monica, Thank you.
14,Rachel," And I also wanted you guys to know that I am telling the father today.
(They all look at her expectantly) What? What? What?"
16,Joey, We know its Ross!
17,Rachel, How?! How do you know?
18,Phoebe," It was his sweater, but—Oh my God!"
19,Rachel," Oh, I so wanted Ross to know first, but I’m so relieved you guys
know."
20,Monica, This is so great! And I’m gonna be your baby’s aunt!
21,Rachel, I know! (They hug.)
22,Phoebe, Me too! (Joins the hug.)
23,Joey, I’m gonna be an uncle! Come here! (He joins the hug.)
24,Rachel, (breaking the hug) You’re all gonna be aunts and uncles.
25,Monica," Yeah, but I’m the only one related by blood."
26,Rachel," Okay. Great! So now that you guys all know you can help me. Give me some
advice on how I’m gonna tell Ross!"
27,Monica," Well, what were you gonna say?"
28,Rachel," Well I was gonna tell him that I’m-I’m gonna have the baby and
he can be as involved as he wants."
29,Joey," Well that, that sounds good."
30,Rachel," Yeah but how do I start? I mean, what’s-what’s the first thing
that I say? (They all pause to think.) Okay great! Thanks. (She starts to leave.)"
31,Monica, Hey! Good luck!
32,Phoebe," Yeah, bye."
33,Joey, Bye.
35,Chandler," (entering) Hey, what was that all about?"
36,Monica," Well I guess there is no harm in telling you now, Rachel and Ross are
gonna have a baby."
37,Chandler," (in a high pitched voice) What?! I didn’t even know that—Why
didn’t you tell me?! (Pause) Why am I talking like this?!"
38,Monica, I didn’t think you could keep it a secret.
39,Chandler," (in the high pitched voice) What?! (Normal voice) I am an excellent
secret keeper. I have kept all of our secrets."
40,Joey, What secrets?
41,Chandler," Oh no-no Joey, I am not going to tell you because I am an excellent
secret keeper."
43,Joey, (whispering to Chandler) You’ll tell me later?
44,Chandler, You already know.
47,Phoebe," Oh, it's so romantic to send people off on their honeymoon."
48,Joey," Y’know, Monica and Chandler are married. Ross and Rachel are having a
baby. Maybe you and I should do something."
49,Phoebe," All in good time my love. All in good time. Oh shoot! I left my guitar
in their apartment. Well you can let me in later."
50,Joey," I don’t have a key, they took mine to give to you."
51,Phoebe, What?! They took mine to give to you!
52,Joey, Why would they take away our keys?
53,Phoebe, Maybe they don’t trust us.
54,Joey," No that’s not it. They let me keep my key the last time they were out
of town. "
55,Phoebe," You mean the time you broke the ketchup bottle and cleaned it up with
Monica’s guest towels?"
56,Joey," Hey, I washed those!"
57,Phoebe, No you didn’t.
58,Joey, Yeah that didn’t sound like me.
59,Phoebe," Well, what am I gonna do? I really need my guitar!"
60,Joey," Yeah, I have stuff in there too."
61,Phoebe, What stuff?
62,Joey," Monica’s chicken parm! I’ll take care of it. (He picks up the
phone) Hey Mr. Treeger, it’s Joey Tribbiani. Listen, I need to get into Monica and
Chandler’s apartment. It’s an emergency. (Listens) Uhh, gas leak! Yeah oh, and
bring garlic bread. (Hangs up.)"
63,Ross, (entering) Hey!
64,Phoebe, Did Rachel find you?
65,Ross, No why?
66,Phoebe, Oh she was looking for you.
67,Ross," Oh well, I guess I’ll catch up with her later."
68,Phoebe," Well, she really wanted to talk to you now."
69,Joey," Yeah, it seemed pretty important."
70,Ross, Oh no.
71,Phoebe, What?
72,Ross, I think I might know what this is about.
74,Joey, Really?
75,Ross," Yeah. Uh, uh we promised we weren’t gonna tell anybody this but uh,
about a month ago Rachel and I slept together."
76,Phoebe, (deadpan) And?
77,Ross, Wow! I thought you would be a little more shocked.
78,Phoebe, Oh sorry. (Shocked) And?!
79,Ross," Well, we-we said we’d just do it that one time but, but now I think
she may wanna start things up again."
80,Joey," Yeah, I don’t think that’s what it is."
81,Ross, Why? What-what else could it be?
82,Joey," Oh wow, I don’t feel well."
83,Ross," I’m telling you. I’m telling you. That’s what it is. No
wonder she was looking at me all funny during the wedding. She didn’t say anything to
you?"
84,Phoebe, (To Joey) Maybe it’s something you ate?
85,Joey," Please, just-just, just go and talk to Rachel."
86,Ross," Yeah, I guess I should. (Starts to leave.) Man, y’know what I have to
realize? Maybe I’m just not the type of guy women can have just one night with.
Y’know, they-they always seem to want a little bit more. I should remember that. (He
pauses and then exits.)"
90,Monica, They’re kissing let’s just go around them.
91,Chandler," Oh honey, leave them alone, they’re in love."
92,Monica, I’m in love too! But in an orderly fashion.
94,Monica," (to the couple) Hi! Can you do that and walk? ‘Cause she
said, ""Next."""
98,Monica," (To Chandler) Did you hear that?! They bumped them up to first class
because they are on their honeymoon! Come on! Let’s act like we’re on our
honeymoon."
99,Chandler, We are on our honeymoon.
100,Monica, Grab my ass!
103,Monica," Hi, sorry. I almost didn’t hear you, because y’know I’m
just so in love with my new husband. We’re on our honeymoon."
105,Monica," Oh no, you see we’re on our honeymoon. So umm, can you do your
little thing and bump us up to first class?"
107,Monica," You see, if we’d gone around them like I said, we—She
would’ve given us those tickets. Damnit!"
108,Chandler," 25J and K, any chance those aren’t together?"
110,Joey, I still can’t believe they took away my key. You trust me with yours.
111,Phoebe," Of course I do! And I’m gonna give it back to you as soon as
they’re done with it at the key shining place."
113,Joey, What the hell is that?
115,Joey," Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Treeger, what are you doing?"
117,Phoebe, Well why don’t you use your key?
120,Phoebe, Oh! We could have done that.
122,Monica," Look at that! Look at that! They’re going into the first class
lounge! Do you know what they have in there?"
123,Chandler, No.
124,Monica," Me neither! We have to get in! (She runs through the door with Chandler
in tow.)"
125,Chandler, Just act like you belong.
126,Monica, Oh my God! Oranges!
127,Chandler," Shh! (To the guy behind the counter) Nice to see you again. (They
tries to walk past him.)"
129,Chandler," Yes, of course. (Shows him the tickets.)"
131,Chandler," Oh that’s all right, I have it memorized. It’s 1A."
133,Chandler, Apology accepted. Excuse us. (They try to enter again.)
135,Monica," Fine. (Starts to walk away then she runs over and grabs an orange before
she exits.) Go! Go! Go!"
137,Rachel, (seeing him) Hi!
138,Ross, Hi.
139,Rachel," Hi. (He helps her up.) Umm, I think there’s something that we
really need to talk about."
140,Ross," (quietly confident) I think we do. Why don’t we go inside? (They go
inside.) Look uh, I know why you’re here."
141,Rachel, You do?
142,Ross," Yeah, and to save you from any embarrassment umm, I think maybe I should
talk first."
143,Rachel, (warily) Okay.
144,Ross," Okay. (He sits her down in a chair.) Uh, Ross and Rachel. Rachel and Ross.
That’s been one heck of a see-saw hasn’t it?"
145,Rachel, (confused) What?
146,Ross," I mean look, that-that one night we had was fun and…and certainly
passionate, but don’t you think it’s better if we just stayed friends?"
147,Rachel, Seriously. What?!
148,Ross," Okay. Okay. Y’know what? If you want to, we can do it one more time.
I mean I’d-I’d be okay with that. In fact, I have some time right now."
149,Rachel," Okay, y’know what? Can I, can I talk now?"
150,Ross, Oh sure. (He sits on the apothecary table and touches her hand.)
151,Rachel," (touches his knee) I’m pregnant. (Ross stops.) Ross? (Ross is
staring off into space.) Ross? (Ross is still frozen) Okay, whenever you’re ready.
(Sits back and opens her magazine.) And you’re the father by the way—but you got
that…"
154,Rachel, (closes her magazine) Can I get you some water?
155,Ross, I’m good. I’m good.
156,Rachel," Ross, there is no pressure on you. Okay? I mean you can as involved as
you want. (Ross nods.)"
157,Ross," Yeah, I need uh… I’m just—I don’t know—I
don’t understand, umm, how this happened? We-we used a condom."
158,Rachel," I know. I know, but y’know condoms only work like 97% of the time."
159,Ross, What? What? What?!! Well they should put that on the box!!!
160,Rachel, They do!
161,Ross," No they don’t!!! (He runs to the bedroom to check and returns with
his box of condoms.) Well they should put it in huge black letters!!!!"
162,Rachel, Okay Ross come on let’s just forget about the condoms.
163,Ross, Oh well I may as well have!
164,Rachel," Listen, y’know what? I was really freaked out too when I found
out…"
165,Ross," Freaked out? Hey no, I’m not freaked out! I’m indignant!
As a consumer!"
166,Rachel," Y’know what? Let’s, let’s talk later."
167,Ross," No! No! I want to talk now! Okay? I—In fact, (picks up the phone) I
am going to talk to the president of the condom company!"
168,Rachel," Okay, y’know maybe I should come back… (Starts to leave.)"
169,Ross, (grabs her) Shh! Shh! Shh!
170,Rachel, (stops) Okay.
171,Ross," (on phone) Yeah I’ll press 1! (Presses one which allows Rachel to
escape.)"
174,Joey, (eating) Huh. So then I can heat this up? (Goes and does so.)
176,Phoebe," Oh great! And listen, could you do us a favor and not tell Chandler and
Monica about this? ‘Cause y’know umm, they don’t-they don’t have any
kids of their own and-and this door was like a child to them."
178,Phoebe, Oh no.
180,Ross, Hi.
182,Ross, Sure.
184,Ross, Namaste. (Bows.)
186,Ross, Oh my God! What happened to the door?!
187,Joey, So it’s noticeable huh?
188,Ross," Look, is Rachel here? I really need to talk to her."
189,Phoebe, Didn’t you two already talk?
190,Ross," Yeah but uh… Okay, okay look you guys know that Rachel and I slept
together, but there’s something else. (Pause) Rachel’s pregnant."
191,Joey, (simultaneously) Oh my God!!! I can’t believe that!!
192,Phoebe, (simultaneously) Holy mother of God!!!
193,Ross, With my child.
194,Phoebe, That is brand new information!!
195,Ross, You already know don’t you?
196,Phoebe, A little bit.
197,Joey, How are you doing?
198,Ross," Okay. Okay. I mean I’ll be okay. It’s just I don’t think I
handled it very well."
199,Joey," Well, what did you say to her?"
200,Ross," Nothing. But the complaint department at the condom company got an earful.
And then when I turned around she was gone."
201,Phoebe, Oh Ross.
202,Ross," But hey, in my defense I-I just found out condoms are like only 97%
effective."
203,Joey, (shocked) What?
204,Ross, I gotta go find her.
205,Joey," Whoa! Hey! Whoa!! Hold up! Are you serious?! So like 3% of the time they
don’t even work?! Huh? They should put that on the box!"
206,Ross, Evidently they do.
207,Joey, What?! (Grabs his condoms from his pocket and looks.)
209,Monica, I can’t believe we’re here.
210,Chandler, Oh you’ve got to be kidding me.
211,Monica, What? (Monica sees the first couple and gasps.)
213,Monica, No!! You have been screwing us all day!
215,Chandler, We’re you just ten seconds later!
216,Monica," Yeah! You already got the first class tickets; you got the lounge! I
mean we should get free stuff too! I mean you’re not the only ones on your honeymoon!"
218,Chandler, (looks at Monica then at them) We need the stuff.
220,Joey," Hey Monica it’s Joey. Listen uh, Phoebe and I smell gas comin’
from your apartment."
221,Monica, What? Are you serious?! (To Chandler) Joey smells gas!
222,Chandler, What else is new?
223,Joey," Yeah and we’d go check it out, but you took away our keys."
224,Monica, Well do something! Get in there!
225,Joey, How? I guess I could break down your door.
226,Monica, Yeah! Do that!
227,Joey," And-and you won’t blame us for any damage? (Gives Phoebe a thumbs
up.)"
228,Monica, No! (Pause) Are you doing it?! I don’t hear anything! Come on!
229,Joey," Uh, okay I’ll-I’ll-I’ll break it down. (He hands the phone
to Phoebe, gets up, picks up a chair, and starts banging it on the floor.)"
230,Phoebe," Oh hey hi, he’s doing it. He’s breaking down the door. (The
chair breaks in half.) Okay, we’re in. (She hangs up the phone.)"
233,Rachel," (sighs) If I said I was, would you judge me?"
235,Rachel," Okay. (The nurse exits.) Oh man, I swear if they sold these at Pottery
Barn…"
237,Ross, Hi!
238,Rachel, (shocked) Hi!
239,Ross, Uh we-we need to talk.
240,Rachel," Uh-uh-uh, right now? Because I’ve kinda got an el fresco situation
going on over here."
241,Ross," Please, please I want to apologize for the way I acted earlier today."
242,Rachel," Okay Ross that’s fine, but can you please stand near my head?"
243,Ross," What? Oh yeah. (He moves next to her head.) I’m sorry. I mean I-I
think I went a little crazy. I mean I was thinking about myself when I (Wanders towards
Rachel’s feet) really—I should have been thinking about you Rach…"
244,Rachel, Okay. Head Ross! Head Ross! Head Ross!
245,Ross," Right! Right! I just—I want you to know that I’m going to be
there through this whole thing, okay? Okay? The doctor’s appointments, the uh, the
Lamaze classes, uh baby-proofing the apartment—Although we could probably worry about
that ‘til after we get married."
246,Rachel, What married?
247,Ross," Well yeah, I think we should get married."
248,Rachel," What, because that’s your answer to everything?"
249,Ross," No, because that’s the right thing to do."
250,Rachel," Yeah, maybe if you’re in love. But Ross, we are not in love, are
we?"
251,Ross, No but…but still you can’t possibly do this alone.
252,Rachel, Excuse me?
253,Ross," Come on Rach, you can’t even eat alone in a restaurant."
254,Rachel, What?!
255,Ross," I’m just saying if you can’t eat by yourself, how do you expect
to have a baby by yourself?"
256,Rachel, I can too eat by myself!
257,Ross, When have you ever?
258,Rachel, When certain people leave the table and I am not finished!
259,Ross, Well certain other people take two hours to eat a bowl of soup!
260,Rachel," Oh please, you inhale your food!"
261,Ross, I grew up with Monica! If you didn’t eat fast you didn’t eat!!
263,Rachel," Oh no Dr. Long, please come in. This is Ross, he is the father."
264,Ross," But not the husband, because evidently she can do this alone."
266,Ross," (To Rachel, standing by her feet) I don’t know why you can’t
admit that you need me."
267,Rachel, I do need you! I need you to stand near my head!
269,Ross, Oh my God.
270,Rachel," Wow. There it is, I see it."
272,Rachel, Okay.
273,Ross, Thank you.
275,Ross, Pretty amazing huh?
276,Rachel, I don’t see it!
277,Ross, What? What?!
278,Rachel, I can’t see it!
279,Ross, You-you just said that you did!
280,Rachel," I know, I lied! I didn’t want her to think I was a terrible mother!
I can’t even see my own baby!"
281,Ross," Oh sure, come here! (Sits her up) Sure you can! Uh, look come here look,
(rolls the machine closer) it’s-it’s-it’s, it’s right there (Points)."
282,Rachel," Oh. Oh, it’s beautiful. I see it now."
283,Ross, Do you really?
284,Rachel," No, I don’t see it!"
285,Ross," Come on! Come on! Here, okay-okay, you see this? (Points) This tiny thing
that looks like a peanut?"
286,Rachel, Yeah.
287,Ross, Sweetie that’s it.
288,Rachel," That’s it? Well I saw that! Ohh-ohh-oh, thank you."
289,Ross, You’re welcome.
290,Rachel, Wow! I can’t believe that’s our baby.
291,Ross," Yeah, that’s our baby."
294,Rachel, Hi.
295,Joey, Hey!
296,Phoebe, Hey! So how was the doctor?
297,Rachel," Oh, everything went great."
298,Phoebe, Good.
299,Ross," Oh hey, show them the picture of your uterus."
301,Phoebe, Oh.
302,Joey, I don’t see the baby. Where is it?
303,Rachel," Oh no, I know I couldn’t see it either at first, but it’s
right umm… (Starts to cry) Ross, I lost it again."
304,Ross, Oh. (He takes the picture and hugs her.
0,Chandler," Wait. Before we go in, I just want you to know I love you. I had a
great time on our honeymoon, and I can’t wait to go in there and spend the rest of
our life together."
1,Monica," You’re really sticking with the shell necklace huh? (Points to
necklace of shells he’s wearing.)"
3,Phoebe, Hi!
4,Joey, Hey! You’re back! (Hugs and kisses all around.)
5,Monica, Hi sweetie!
6,Phoebe, Come on in! 
8,Phoebe, So how was the honeymoon?
9,Monica," Oh, so much fun. But the best part is, we met this incredible couple on
the way back."
10,Phoebe, That was the best part? (To Chandler) Good honeymooning tiger.
11,Monica," No, they were really cool. They were on their honeymoon too!"
12,Chandler," They’re terrific, and they live right here in the city."
13,Monica," Yeah, can we go call them? Is it too soon to call? I wanna call."
14,Chandler," I’m sorry, we’re just kinda excited because we finally have
a couple to hang out with."
15,Monica, I know.
16,Joey," A couple? Like two people? Like (points to himself) one (points to
Phoebe), two people?"
17,Monica, This is different! Greg and Jenny are in a relationship.
18,Phoebe," Oh, Greg and Jenny yuck! (Angrily) Hi Greg, I’m Chandler this is
Monica. Hi Monica, this is Jenny. Hi Jenny. Hi Greg."
19,Chandler," Listen, they are really great. If you just got a chance…"
20,Joey," Y’know what? Why don’t you just give us our souvenirs and get
the hell out of here?"
21,Chandler, We really…didn’t get a chance to…
22,Phoebe, You have got to be kidding me!
23,Monica, We didn’t get anything for anyone.
24,Joey, Hm-mm! Yeah nice necklace!
25,Monica, That you can have.
29,Rachel, Hi!
31,Ross, Hello!
32,Rachel, Welcome home.
33,Ross," So, how was the honeymoon?"
34,Monica," It was great! It was great! How about you?! I mean you’re having a
baby!"
35,Rachel, Oh! Look! I have a sonogram picture! 
36,Monica, Oh great! (Shows them the picture.)
37,Chandler, Ross! It’s got your wavy black lines!
38,Monica," All right, so now that Ross knows can you tell us y’know how it
happened? I mean, when did it happen? How many times did it happen?"
39,Phoebe, Monica! That’s not right! Start with where.
41,Rachel," Well it happened about six weeks ago, and uh I had just got home from
work and Ross was already there ‘cause I guess he had been hanging out with Joey."
42,Joey, You’re welcome buddy.
43,Ross," (glaring at him) Yeah, thanks. (Joey nods no problem.)"
44,Rachel," And so I had a lot of work to do so Ross, nice guy that he is, offered
to help me out. And then we had a little wine, we got to talking, and the next thing you
know out of nowhere Ross comes on to me."
45,Ross, (laughs) Umm that’s…that’s a little misleading.
46,Rachel, What is?
47,Ross, The lie you just told.
48,Rachel, That-that you came on to me?
49,Ross, There’s the one!
50,Rachel," But you did! I mean, let’s be honest."
51,Ross," Yes let’s. Y’know what? Uh, it’s-it’s not important.
What is important is that, is that we’re having a baby. And it’s
not—Doesn’t matter who came on to who."
52,Joey, Whom. (Everyone looks at him shocked.) That’s right.
53,Rachel, You know you kissed me first.
54,Ross," What? What?! You were begging me to kiss you! You-you-you were sending me
signals all over the place!"
55,Rachel, I was sending you signals?
56,Ross, Yeah!
57,Rachel," Oh please. Okay, anyone in this room think that I would send Ross
begging symbols, please show of hands. (Ross raises his hand and no one else.)"
58,Ross," Y’know what?! It doesn’t matter! It doesn’t matter what you
believe! What matters is what happened!"
59,Rachel," Okay. So these signals Ross, explain this to me, ‘cause maybe I
need to be more careful. I mean, am I sending you these signals right now?"
60,Ross," Y’know what? Y’know what? Rachel, just-just drop it."
61,Rachel," No please, show me how I begged you!"
62,Ross," I can show you, I have it on videotape! (Stunned silence) It’s an
expression."
65,Phoebe, I can’t believe he taped the two of them having sex!
66,Joey, Yeah! You gotta tell a girl before you tape her. Such a rookie mistake.
67,Chandler, Y’know who has a great video camera?
68,Phoebe, (nasally) Greg and Jenny?
69,Monica, Do you still wanna call ‘em? I wanna call ‘em.
70,Chandler, Let’s call ‘em.
71,Joey, Yeah! Ask them if they brought their friends any souvenirs!
73,Monica, (on phone) Hello? (Listens) Eighth street deli?
74,Joey," Hey, hang up! You get food poisoning just talkin’ to that place."
75,Monica," (on phone) Uh sorry, wrong number. (Hangs up)"
76,Chandler, Here you go. (Shows her the number again.)
77,Monica, (on phone) Hello? (Listens) (To All) It’s the deli again!
78,Joey, All right! I’ll have a sandwich!
79,Monica, (hangs up) I don’t think this number’s right!
81,Chandler, What?
82,Phoebe, You got fake numbered.
83,Monica, What?! People don’t do that!
84,Joey, Oh I think we do.
85,Monica, They gave us a fake number? Why? Why would they do that?
86,Chandler," I don’t know! You were a delight to talk to. You asked all those
insightful, great questions."
87,Monica," And you’ve never been funnier. Joke, joke, joke, you were a hoot!"
88,Joey," Y’know what? Don’t worry about it, you still got me and Phoebe."
89,Phoebe," Excuse me, I don’t want Greg and Jenny’s rejects."
90,Ross," (entering) Rachel won’t talk to me! She won’t even open the
door!"
91,Phoebe," Hmm, I wonder why. Pervert!"
92,Ross," Okay, listen I am not a pervert!"
93,Phoebe," That’s like the pervert motto! Yeah! Yeah! They have you raise your
right hand, put your left hand down your pants, and repeat that!"
94,Ross," Filming Rachel is not something I planned. Okay look, here’s what
happened, and Joey you-you can back me up on this. All right, about-about a month and a
half ago I came to you with a problem? Umm, a personal thing. "
95,Joey, Personal thing? What personal thing? I don’t know.
96,Ross," About…about sex? (Joey looks at him confused) That I hadn’t had
sex in months?"
97,Joey, (laughs) Yeah I knew what you were talkin’ about.
100,Ross, Hey!
101,Joey, Hey.
102,Ross," Do you have a minute? I’d like to talk to you about something
I’m, I’m really uncomfortable talking about."
103,Joey," Sure. What? About uh, you showering with your mom?"
104,Ross," I actually had a topic in mind! I’m, I’m kinda going through a
dry spell, sex wise."
105,Joey," Whoa, for like months?"
106,Ross," Five to be lying, six."
107,Joey, Six months? Whoa that’s rough.
108,Ross," Well, I mean it’s not all bad. I’m learning to appreciate the
uh, smaller things in life. Like the sound of a bird and the color of the sky."
109,Joey, The sky’s blue Ross and I had sex yesterday!
110,Ross," Please, help me! I have a date tonight. It has to go well
okay—I’m scared for my health!"
111,Joey," Okay. Okay. Umm…Ooh! Oh-oh, I got something. It’s this story I
came up with, very romantic. I swear any woman that hears it; they’re like putty."
112,Ross, Really? Well then tell it to me.
113,Joey," Okay. Now you’re gonna want to have sex with me when you hear it, but
you have to remember it is just the story."
114,Ross, (sarcastic) I’ll try to control myself.
115,Joey," Okay. (Clears throat) Years ago, when I was backpacking across Western
Europe…"
116,Ross, (laughs) You were backpacking across Western Europe?
117,Joey, Have a nice six more months Ross! (Starts to leave.)
118,Ross," (stopping him) Okay! Okay! Okay. I’m sorry. Please, please, you were
in Western Europe and?"
119,Joey," I was just outside Barcelona hiking in the foothills of Mount Tibidabo. I
was at the end of this path and I came to a clearing and there was a lake, very secluded.
And there were tall trees all around. (Whispering) It was dead silent. Gorgeous. (Softly)
And across the lake I saw…a beautiful woman…bathing herself…but she was
crying…"
120,Ross, (intently listening) Why?
123,Ross," It’s from France…In Europe…Western Europe. Y’know umm,
a few years ago I actually was backpacking across Western Europe."
125,Ross," Uh-hmm—Wait! It gets better. Um, yeah I was in Barcelona."
127,Ross," Anyway, umm so I was um, I was hiking…"
129,Ross," (whines) Oh that’s great! I was hiking along the foothills of Mount
Tibidaybo…"
131,Ross, Okay! Do you wanna tell the story?!
133,Joey, Whoa! What are you doing here? How did your date go?
134,Ross," Great! I’m across the street having sex with her right now. Your
story sucks!"
135,Joey," Hey! Look, if it didn’t work it’s because you didn’t tell
it right! Show me how you did it."
136,Ross," No! No, I don’t…don’t want to."
137,Joey, How long since you’ve seen a girl naked?
138,Ross, I was backpacking across Western Europe.
139,Joey, I’m not feeling it.
140,Ross," I was just outside Barcelona, hiking…"
141,Joey, No! No! No Ross! I’m not hot! Are you hot?
142,Ross, It’s been six months! I’m always hot!
143,Joey," Well you’re not selling the story! It’s like; it’s like you
don’t believe it! Look, I gotta go. I got a date, but try this. Do what I do when
I’m preparing for an audition. Okay? I’ll set you up with my video camera and
you can record yourself and-and see what you’re doing wrong."
144,Ross, I’ll try that.
145,Joey," All right now… All right, you’re all set up. You’re good to
go. Just hit record. All right?"
146,Ross, Thanks.
147,Joey, Good luck.
148,Ross, Thanks. And-and hey Joe?
149,Joey, Yeah?
150,Ross," Listen, if you ever have any problem with the ladies you know I’ll
help you out."
151,Joey, (trying not to laugh) That means a lot to me man. (Exits.)
153,Ross," Hello! Can I get you anything? Huh? Lens cleaner? Your battery okay?
(Rachel bursts in carrying two boxes and Ross jumps up.) Rachel!"
154,Rachel, Oh Ross!
155,Ross, Hi!
156,Rachel," Thank God you’re here! You have to help me! Were you just talking
to yourself?"
157,Ross," That’s less embarrassing, yes. Yes I was."
159,Ross," (voiceover) So when she came in, I got distracted and totally forgot about
the camera. [Cut back to the present day.] It kept rolling and recorded everything."
161,Chandler," Yeah, we’re gonna need to see that tape. (They rest of them
agree.)"
162,Monica," Yeah, definitely."
163,Ross, What a great idea! That will get Rachel to forgive me!
164,Joey," Y’know what? This is not fair to her. Let’s just forget the
tape!"
165,Ross," Thank you. (Joey mouths to Ross, ""You’ll show me right?"")
No!"
166,Joey," You’re right. (Mouths, ""I know you’ll show me, right?)"
167,Ross, Joey! No!
168,Joey," Loud and clear! (Mouths, ""You’ll show me,"" and nods.)"
171,Monica, I still don't get why Greg and Jenny would give us a fake number.
172,Joey," Y’know, if they knew what they were doing they probably didn’t
give you real names either."
173,Monica," Okay, maybe people give out fake numbers, but they don’t give out
fake names."
174,Joey," Oh yeah? (To Phoebe) Hi, Ken Adams, nice to meet you."
175,Phoebe, Regina Philange. (Ken and Regina shake hands.)
176,Chandler," I still don’t get it, we didn’t do anything wrong."
177,Monica," I know! Although, you did tell an awful lot of jokes."
178,Chandler, I thought you said those jokes were funny. Joke! Joke! Joke!
179,Monica," (rolling her head from side to side) Joke. Joke. Blah! Blah! (Joey and
Phoebe laugh.)"
180,Chandler, Well maybe it was all of your questions.
181,Monica, What about my questions?
182,Chandler," The sheer volume, it was like flying with the Riddler!"
183,Monica," Oh, I’m sorry. Was that another joke?"
184,Chandler, (angrily) Was that another question?
185,Rachel, (entering) Hey! Is Ross still here?
186,Joey," Uh no Rach, he’s gone. But listen, he told us what happened and it
does, it sounds like an honest mistake."
187,Rachel," Oh really? Well how would you like it if I had sex with you and I taped
it? (Joey smiles luridly) Oh forget it! (Ross enters.) Oh there he is now, the father of
my child, the porn king of the west village."
188,Ross," Look, it was accident! Okay? I-I feel bad that it happened, but I swear, I
didn’t even watch it! Anyway, here. (He takes the tape out of his coat pocket.) I
thought you might be more comfortable destroying it yourself. (Tosses her the tape.)"
189,Rachel," Thank you. (She sets it on the floor and is about to stomp on it with
her shoe when the rest of the gang jumps up and yells simultaneously.) What? (They all
yell again.) You don’t want to see this do you?"
190,Monica, Hell yeah!!!
191,Rachel, I am not gonna show you this!
192,Phoebe," No! Not the sex part, just the stuff leading up to it."
193,Ross," Forget it, she’s destroying it."
194,Phoebe," Okay fine! Fine! We’ll just have to think of some other way to put
the whole ‘Who came onto who,’ thing to rest! Come on now, think!!"
195,Ross," Look, forget it Phoebe. Okay? It’s Rachel’s tape and she can do
whatever she wants with it. And she wants to destroy it. So, end of story."
196,Rachel, I wanna see it.
197,Ross, What?!
198,Rachel," Clearly you don’t want people to see this tape. Now I don’t
want people to see this tape either, but you so badly don’t people to see it makes me
want to see it. You see?"
199,Joey, (confused) Are we watchin’ the tape or not?!
200,Ross, I don’t want people to see it for your sake.
201,Rachel," Ahh, I don’t believe you. I think you don’t want them to see
you begging me. (Goes to put the tape in the VCR)"
202,Ross," Rachel, please…"
203,Rachel," Ah, a little preview!"
204,Ross," Fine. Fine, but I want the record to show that I tried to take the high
road, because in about five minutes I’m gonna be saying…(He laughs and points at
Rachel sarcastically.)"
206,Rachel," Okay, here we go. (Pushes play.)"
207,Ross, (on tape) Hello! Can I get you anything?
208,Joey, (To Phoebe) I’m so happy!
211,Rachel," (on tape) Oh, thank God you’re here! You have to help me! Were you
just talking to yourself?"
212,Rachel, There I am.
213,Phoebe, You’re gonna get pregnant.
214,Rachel," (on tape) I screwed up so bad, I told Monica that I would stuff and send
all these wedding invitations like weeks ago and I-I…"
215,Ross, (on tape) You didn’t do it?
216,Rachel," (on tape) I-I know—I had put them in…in-in my desk at work and
I completely forgot about them until today."
218,Monica," (taking Rachel’s hand) Sweetie okay. It’s okay. Everybody made
it to the wedding. I’m fine."
219,Rachel, Kinda hurtin’ my hand though.
220,Monica, I know.
221,Rachel," (on tape) (Ross hands her a glass of wine) I cannot believe that I did
this. Especially after Monica just went on and on and on about it! (Mimicking Monica)
""Okay Rachel! Here are the invitations Rachel! Now be very careful Rachel! Please,
drinking no liquids around the invitations Rachel!"" (She tilts her wine glass above
and moves it back and forth across the invitations) Whoa oh! Oh-oh-oh!
Oh…oh-oh-oh…"
223,Chandler, Did you do it on our invitations?!
224,Ross, (pause) Not on the ones we sent out.
225,Chandler," So, just the ones gave back to us and we had framed! (Slams the framed
invitation down onto the table.)"
227,Rachel," (on tape) Can you believe this is already happening? I mean it seems
like yesterday they just got engaged."
228,Ross," (on tape) I know. Hey remember…remember the night they got engaged?
How uh, you and I almost…"
229,Rachel," (on tape) Oh, I remember how we almost. Do you think we would’ve
gone through with it? Y’know, if we hadn’t gotten caught. Do you think we
would’ve done it?"
230,Ross," (on tape) I mean I…I know I wanted to. I just, I just wasn’t
sure if you wanted to."
231,Rachel, (on tape) Oh I wanted to.
233,Ross, (on tape) So we…we both wanted to.
234,Rachel, (on tape) Interesting.
235,Ross," (on tape) Yeah. (Pause) Anyway umm, it probably worked out for the best."
236,Rachel," (on tape) Oh yeah, sure."
237,Rachel," Okay, in about ten seconds you’re gonna see him kiss me."
238,Ross, And in about five seconds you’re gonna see why.
239,Rachel," (on tape) Ross did I ever tell you about the time that I went
backpacking through Western Europe?"
241,Rachel," Okay, get ready to see some beggin’!"
242,Phoebe," Oh, you came on to Ross!"
243,Rachel, What?!
244,Ross, Now I’m so happy.
245,Rachel, What are you talking about?!
246,Monica, You used the Europe story!
247,Chandler, That’s the magic story you use when you wanna have sex!
248,Rachel, How do you know about that story?!
249,Joey, How do you know about that story?!
250,Rachel, I heard it from my friend Irene who heard it from some guy!
251,Joey, (raises his hand) Some guy!! (Points to himself.)
252,Rachel," No. No, she told me his name was Ken Adams."
253,Joey, (raises his hand and points to himself again) Ken Adams!!
255,Ross, Hi.
256,Rachel," So uh, apparently people are familiar with the Europe story?"
257,Ross," Yeah. Listen about that, the whole uh, who came on to who thing really
doesn’t matter. I mean, I think it would’ve happened either way. I mean if you
hadn’t initiated it I-I-I know I would’ve."
258,Rachel, It was an amazing night.
259,Ross, It was. It was an amazing night.
261,Rachel, You think it looked amazing?
262,Ross," I uh… I don’t know. I mean I…I honestly didn’t watch
it."
263,Rachel," Yeah, me neither. Yet…"
264,Ross, Uhhhhhh…that-that may be weird.
265,Rachel," Yeah, it would be really weird."
267,Ross, Good luck.
268,Rachel, Good luck to you.
270,Ross, Mind if I mute?
271,Rachel, Oh please. (He does so.)
272,Ross," Oh, oh there go the clothes."
273,Rachel, You are undressing very quickly.
274,Ross," Six months Rachel, six months."
276,Ross, Hey. We-we look…we look pretty good.
277,Rachel, That’s what I was gonna say.
278,Ross, Oh nice tan!
279,Rachel, Thank you! I had just gone to the beach that weekend.
280,Ross, Ah….
281,Rachel, Have you been working out?
282,Ross, I have been working out.
283,Rachel," Really? Wow, this is so much better than I…"
285,Ross, Oh that’s not pretty.
286,Rachel, Oh! Oh!
287,Ross, No!
288,Rachel, Oh God!
289,Ross, Oh no!
290,Rachel," Oh, make it stop!"
291,Ross, Oh no!!
292,Rachel, Make it stop!!
293,Ross, No!!
294,Rachel, Have to make it stop!!
295,Ross, No!!!
299,Monica," (on phone) Hello Greg? (Listens) Hi, this is Monica from the plane?
Listen, the number that you gave me 853-5… (Listens) (To Chandler) That is their old
number! Jenny’s been giving it out since they moved!"
300,Chandler, Jenny! That is so Jenny!
301,Monica," (on phone) Hey listen umm, how would you like to get together? Say next
Saturday? (Listens) Okay, how about Sunday? (Listens) Okay umm, the week after that?
(Listens) The week after that? (Listens) Y’know what Greg? Y’know what? We are
good, interesting, funny people with good questions and if you and your precious
Jenny can’t see that then… (Listens) January 15th? (Chandler dances.)
We’ll see you then! (Listens) Okay! "
0,Monica," Okay, now this one is rare, this one is medium well! Now go-go-go!
(Phoebe enters) Hey Phoebe!"
1,Phoebe, Hey!
2,Monica, Hey how was dinner?!
3,Phoebe, Dinner was good! 
4,Monica, Okay!
5,Phoebe, I’m just saying hi! Now I’m gonna go! 
6,Monica, Okay!
8,Phoebe," (To him) Oh, well hello there."
10,Phoebe, (To Monica) I didn’t see this on the menu.
11,Monica," Uh Tim? This is Phoebe. Phoebe this is Tim, my new sous chef."
12,Phoebe," Oh, so you're Monica’s boss?"
14,Phoebe, Oh! I sous stand.
15,Monica," Hey Tim? I need a calamari and a Caesar salad. And umm, could you get me
the pesto?"
17,Phoebe, Oh you…you made pesto?
19,Phoebe, Would you say your pesto is the best-o?
22,Monica," All right, I still need a calamari and a Caesar salad."
24,Phoebe, I made it myself.
26,Phoebe," Well, it’s no pesto."
27,Monica," All right, all right! Let’s just cut to the chase, okay? (To
Phoebe) You’re single. (To Tim) You’re single. (To Phoebe) He gets off work at
eleven. (To Tim) She’ll be waiting for your call. (To Phoebe) I’ll give him your
number if I can get one calamari and one Caesar salad!! (Everyone in the kitchen stops.) I
did not yell. I am not putting a dollar in the jar."
31,Chandler," You know me sir. Oh ah, I do have a question for ya. Do you know how I
get around the office computer network so I can access the really good Internet porn?"
33,Chandler, What’s funny about that?
34,Ross, (running up) Hey! Sorry I kept you waiting so long.
35,Chandler," Hey that’s okay. So, where do you want to go?"
36,Ross," Oh ah, I think you know where I want to go."
37,Chandler, The Hard Rock Café?
38,Ross, Yeah!
39,Chandler, Again?!
40,Ross, Yeah!!
42,Ross," I’m telling you, I like the food!"
43,Chandler, You like the Purple Rain display! (A guy walks up.) Hey Bob.
45,Ross, Did that guy just call you Toby?
46,Chandler," Yeah, he thinks that’s my name."
47,Ross," Well, why don’t you correct him?"
48,Chandler," Oh it’s been going on way to long now. Y’know, I mean the
first time he said it we were just passing each other in the hallway, so I didn’t say
anything. And then the next time he said, ""Hey Toby, do you want a donut?"" And
I-I wanted a donut. And now it’s five years later, the donut’s gone and I’m
still Toby."
49,Ross, Five years?! Chandler you have to tell him!
50,Chandler," No! That would be so awkward! Look—Besides, we work in different
departments. He’s on the sixth floor y’know? So he calls me Toby once in a
while. What’s the big deal? It could be worse, it’s not like he’s calling
me Muriel. (Chandler suddenly freezes into place.)"
51,Ross," (laughs) Muriel. Wh-why would he call you Muriel? (Ross realizes
something.) Oh my God! Chandler M Bing? It’s not just an M, your middle name
is Muriel!!"
52,Chandler, Shh! It is a family name!
53,Ross," Chandler Muriel Bing. Boy, your parents never gave you a chance did they?"
64,Joey," (To Rachel) Okay, let me just get changed and we can go to dinner."
65,Rachel, Well don’t—What happened to Jessica’s body?!
66,Joey," I’m not telling, you’ll have to see it on TV!"
67,Rachel, You don’t know do you?
68,Joey," No, couldn’t care less."
70,Joey, Hey you too!
73,Joey, What? You weren’t in it.
74,Rachel, Oh! (Motions to Joey’s co-star.)
75,Joey," Oh sorry. Uh-uh, Kash?"
77,Joey," This is my friend Rachel. Rachel, Kash, Kash, Rachel."
78,Rachel, Hi.
80,Rachel," Well, Joey probably thinks I’ll just embarrass him. Y’know, he
thinks I’m some kind of a soap opera nut—Which I’m not! I’m not.
Although I do know that your uh, your favorite ice cream flavor is butter pecan. (Starts
stroking his arm) And uh, and that your-your dog’s name is Wally. Well look at that,
I’m just stroking your arm."
81,Joey," (grabbing her) Here we go! Here we go! (Starts to pull her away from
Kash.)"
82,Rachel," Oh, we’re leaving. Bye Kash."
84,Rachel, Say hi to Wally.
86,Phoebe, Ooh Monica!
87,Monica, Hi!
88,Phoebe," Oh my God! I had the best time with Tim last night. He is so
sweet! Oh, I can’t wait to get sous-neath him."
89,Monica, I…I have to fire him.
90,Phoebe, But why?!
91,Monica," Because he’s terrible! Okay, he’s slow, he burns things, last
night he lit my pastry chef on fire!"
92,Phoebe," Well maybe he was just nervous, y’know you can be very
intimidating. And besides I’ve met your pastry chef and she can stand to be taken
down a peg or two."
93,Monica," Well, now she has no eyebrows, mission accomplished."
94,Phoebe," But Monica, he loves his job so much! Can you just give him another
chance? Please?"
95,Monica," (thinks about it) All right, but if-if he lights someone else on fire he
is out of there!"
96,Phoebe," That’s fair! Thank you so much. Thanks. Oops, it looks like when he
got the pastry chef he got you a little bit too."
97,Monica, I paid to have this done.
98,Phoebe, Love it!
100,Joey, Hey!
101,Rachel, Hi!
102,Joey," Oh you know uh Kash, really liked you the other day. He said he thought
you were charming."
103,Rachel, I thought I was a complete idiot.
104,Joey," Hey, I’m with you. He even asked me if I thought you’d go out
with him."
105,Rachel," Oh! Oh, I think I’m gonna throw up a little bit. What did you say?"
106,Joey, I said no.
107,Rachel, What?!
108,Joey," What? I…I just figured since you’re pregnant you’re not
gonna be seeing people."
109,Rachel," Okay Joey, first of all Kash Ford is not people. Second of all, what did
he say when you told him I was pregnant?"
110,Joey," I didn’t tell him. I didn’t know if you were telling people.
This is back when I thought Kash was still people."
111,Rachel," Good-good, don’t tell him. Don’t tell him. Just have him call
me okay?"
112,Joey," Rach look, I really don’t think that’s such a great…"
113,Rachel," Okay, you go do it! I’ll come back to that set! I’ll meet more
actors! I’ll meet ‘em all!"
115,Chandler, Hey Bob.
117,Chandler," If I see him, I’ll ask."
121,Chandler, Yeah!
123,Chandler, We’re on a semi-first name basis.
125,Chandler," Bob? Ooh, working here with us? Everyday? Yeah, I don’t know if
he has what it takes."
127,Chandler, But this is eleven. It’s almost twice as hard up here.
129,Chandler, I think it’s best sir.
131,Chandler," Y’know what you should do, just toss ‘em in the shedder and
claim you never got ‘em."
133,Chandler," What does a guy have to do to be taken seriously around
here?!"
135,Phoebe, Hey!
136,Monica," Hey. Okay, I gave him another chance, but Tim has got to go!"
137,Phoebe, But…
138,Monica," No! No-no! He is totally incompetent. I called the chef who recommended
him to me. He said, ""Ha-ha! Gotcha!"""
139,Phoebe," Okay. Okay, but you can’t fire him today."
140,Monica, Why not?!
141,Phoebe, Because I’m dumping him today.
142,Monica, What?! You said he was sweet!
143,Phoebe," He is sweet. He’s too sweet. He calls me all the time.
(Mimicking him) ""So did-did you get home from work okay?"" ""Did-did you get
out of the shower okay?"""
144,Monica, Just don’t pick up your phone.
145,Phoebe," Then he comes over! (Mimicking him) ""I’m so worried about
you."" Uck! Be a man!"
146,Monica, What? So now I’m not allowed to fire him?
147,Phoebe," You can’t fire him and dump him the same day, he’ll kill
himself."
148,Monica," Okay well then, I’ll fire him today and you go out with him for
another week."
149,Phoebe," Are you kidding?! Another week with that sip, I’ll kill myself!"
150,Monica," Okay well, then we’ll both do it today and he’ll just have to
deal with it!"
151,Phoebe," Okay. But the question is who’s gonna go first. ‘Cause whoever
goes second is the bitch."
152,Monica, What do you mean?
153,Phoebe," Come on! The boss that fires a guy that’s just been dumped, bitch!
And the woman who dumps a guy that’s just been fired, blond bitch!"
154,Monica, I wanted to do this days ago so I think I should go first.
155,Phoebe," All right, that makes sense. (Starts towards the door.) Ugh.
But—Screw you I’m going first! (She grabs her purse and runs out.)"
158,Chandler," Sure, what’s up?"
161,Rachel," Hey, what do you think is a better excuse for why I’m not drinking
on this date tonight. ""Umm, I’m a recovering alcoholic. I’m a Mormon,""
or ""I got so hammered last night I’m still a little drunk?"""
162,Ross, (entering with a pizza and beer) Hey!
163,Rachel, Hi!
164,Joey, Hey!
165,Ross," So, what do you want to do tonight? There’s a Ukrainian film at the
Angelica that’s supposed to be very powerful. Interested?"
166,Joey, No. No. But I’ll go see a normal person movie with ya.
167,Ross, Rach? You wanna come?
168,Rachel," Oh no, I can’t. I got a date."
169,Ross, A date?
170,Rachel, Yeah. Why? Is that weird for you?
171,Ross," Why no, it’s the opposite of weird. It’s-it’s uh, regular.
It’s-it’s uh, it’s mundane. It’s actually uh, a little dull."
172,Joey, It’s no Ukrainian film.
173,Rachel, Yeah—Ooh! Earrings! (Goes into her room.)
174,Ross, A date?! She’s-she’s got a date?! With who?
175,Joey, I set her up with this actor on my show.
176,Ross, You set her up?!
177,Joey, No
178,Ross, Joey what-what were you thinking?!
179,Joey," Well, I was thinking that it’d probably be okay because Ross
hasn’t gone out with Rachel in five years!"
180,Ross," Joey, I’m not worried about her! I’m worried about my baby!
Whoever she dates my baby dates! Now-now where is this (makes the quote-marks sign) actor
taking them?"
181,Joey," Hey! I’m an (does the quote-marks thing as well) actor too! I’m
not sure. I think they’re taking the ferry out to some Italian place on Staten
Island."
182,Ross," A ferry? My baby is going on a ferry? Do you have any idea how dangerous
those are?!"
183,Joey," Are we talking about one of those big boats that carry cars that go like
five miles an hour?"
184,Ross," Why don’t they just jump out of an airplane?! Huh?! That-that’s
a fun date! Or burn each other with matches?! That’s fun too! Whew!!"
187,Joey," Hey Kash. Uh hey-hey this is Ross. Ross, this is Kash."
189,Ross, Hi. I-I hear you’re going on a ferry tonight.
191,Ross, A bit of a daredevil are we?
192,Rachel," (entering from her room) Hey guys do you think this is too
slutty—Hi Kash!"
194,Rachel," Yeah! All right, I’ll see you guys later."
195,Ross, Okay. Have a great time you guys.
196,Rachel, Thank you.
198,Ross," Yes it is too slutty! (Joey slams the door before Rachel could hear the
entire sentence.)"
202,Phoebe, Hi.
204,Phoebe," It will be…in a minute. Listen, Tim you’re a really great guy."
206,Phoebe," Aw. (Phoebe gets a bad taste in her mouth when he looks away) I’m
just—I’m in a place in my life right now where I…I…"
209,Phoebe, Oh-oh no she doesn’t! I know what that is. You can stay.
212,Joey," So what movie do you want to see—And not another one I have to read.
Okay? I get enough of that from books."
213,Ross, Books?
214,Joey," All right, car magazines, cereal boxes, but it’s like enough!"
215,Ross," Well, I tell you what. Why don’t we uh, why don’t we just stay
here? Let’s not see a movie, we’ll just hang."
216,Joey, And just wait for Rachel to come back from her date?
217,Ross," Hey, if that’s what you want to do I’m not gonna say no."
218,Joey, Dude! What is going on?!
219,Ross, I just…I have to find out how it went.
220,Joey, Why?
221,Ross, This guy could be my baby’s stepfather!
222,Joey," They go on one date and you’re worried about them getting married?!
He’s not you!"
223,Ross, I just—I-I can’t believe she’s-she’s dating?!
224,Joey," Well Ross, what did you think she was gonna do?"
225,Ross," I don’t know! I guess I just can’t believe any of this is
happening."
226,Joey, What do you mean?
227,Ross," It’s just I always thought when I had another kid it would be
different. Now I-I love Ben, but every time I have to drop him off at Carol and
Susan’s, it’s like—It breaks my heart a little. I mean I’ve always had
this picture of me and my next wife in bed on Sunday and, my kid comes running in and
leaps up onto the bed. And we all read the paper together. Y’know? Maybe fight over
the science section."
228,Joey, That’s a nice picture. Maybe you can still have that!
229,Ross," No! No I can’t. I mean Rachel’s out with some guy. My baby went
with her. If anything that picture keeps moving further away."
230,Joey," Hey, can I ask you something? In this, in this picture of you and your
wife, is your wife Rachel?"
231,Ross," It used to be. Now she doesn’t really have a face. Smokin’ body
though."
232,Joey," Good call. Yeah. But, the face Ross, the face isn’t Rachel."
233,Ross, No but ahh! How much easier would it be if it were?
234,Joey," I know, but I don’t think that’s what she wants."
235,Ross," No, it’s not what I want either. I mean I-I can’t force myself
to fall in love with her again now."
236,Joey," That’s okay Ross maybe you need a new picture. Okay? It’s not
gonna be what you thought, but no matter what there’s gonna be a brand new little
baby, your baby. Who cares what the picture looks like?"
237,Ross, Yeah.
238,Joey," Hey, I tell you what. Let’s you and me go out and have some fun. Huh?
Whatever you want. Come on!"
239,Ross, (checks his watch) We can still catch that Ukrainian film.
240,Joey," No, I said fun!"
243,Chandler, Hey Bobby.
245,Chandler," Uhh yeah. Yeah, it’s (Points down the hall) right, right down
there. (When he has Bob looking down the hall, he turns around and knocks his nameplate
off of his door.) Right there, yeah. Can I ask you why?"
247,Chandler," Okay Bob listen uhh, I’m the reason you didn’t get the job
up here."
249,Chandler, Bob!
251,Chandler, Well that puts me in a difficult position.
253,Monica, Hey.
255,Monica," Uh well that depends, how are things with Phoebe?"
257,Monica," Oh my pleasure. Okay, I’m afraid I’ve got some bad news.
(Phoebe enters.) Phoebe!"
258,Phoebe, Monica!
259,Monica, (simultaneously) You’re fired!
260,Phoebe, (simultaneously) I’m breaking up with you!
262,Phoebe," I’m, I’m breaking up with you."
263,Monica, You’re fired.
265,Phoebe," I’m sorry, I’m just—I’m…I’m just not ready
for a relationship right now."
266,Monica," Yeah and-and I’m sorry too. But, well I just—I like things
done a certain way and the chemistry’s just not right."
267,Phoebe," Oh that’s good, the chemistry thing for us too."
269,Monica, Tim wait!
271,Monica," Umm, I think I spoke too quickly. There-there’s a learning curve
with this job and maybe we can try it again."
273,Monica, Yeah.
275,Monica, Okay.
277,Phoebe," And Tim I just wanna say, good luck here. (Shakes his hand and leaves,
which disgusts Monica.)"
279,Ross, Hello.
280,Rachel, Hi!
281,Ross," Well, how was the date?"
282,Rachel," Well I’m alone and I just bought fifteen dollars worth of candy
bars, what do you think?"
283,Ross, Uh-huh. What happened?
284,Rachel, I made the mistake of telling him that I was pregnant.
285,Ross," Ah, he didn’t uh, take it so well?"
286,Rachel," Well better than you, but y’know still not what you want."
287,Ross, Oh?
288,Rachel," He got all weird and sputtery and then he said uh, ""Yeah, I hear
those hemorrhoids are a bitch."""
289,Ross, He sounds swell.
290,Rachel, Doesn’t he?
291,Ross," Hey, wanna…wanna a little cheering up?"
292,Rachel, Yes.
293,Ross, Sit down. 
294,Rachel, Okay.
296,Ross, Guess whose middle name is Muriel.
297,Rachel, (thinks then gasps) Chandler M. Bing?
298,Ross, Yeah-ha!
299,Rachel, Oh my God. (Laughs)
300,Ross, I’m sorry about your date.
301,Rachel," Oh it’s all right. I’m guess I’m just done with the whole
dating thing. It’s one more thing in my life that’s suddenly completely
different. This is hard."
302,Ross," Yeah I know. (Pause) On the other hand in um, in about seven months
you’re gonna have something that you’re gonna love more than any guy you’ve
ever gone out with. Just wait. Wait until uh, wait until the first time your baby grabs
your finger. You have no idea."
303,Rachel, Thanks sweetie.
304,Ross," You wanna, you wanna grab some coffee?"
305,Rachel," Oh no, I think I’m gonna go home and eat ten candy bars."
306,Ross," Hey, I thought I cheered you up."
307,Rachel," Oh you did, there are twenty in here."
308,Ross, Right. Good night.
309,Rachel, Good night.
313,Ross, Yeah?
315,Ross, Oh hi!
317,Ross, Wow! Uh…how are you?
319,Ross," Oh that’s right. Well uh, would you be interested in seeing a
Ukrainian film?"
321,Ross, Great! Well umm…
324,Ross," Sure! Uh, let me get it for ya."
330,Chandler," (entering) Bob. Bob! Bob!!! (He turns around) What the hell are you
doing?!"
0,Monica, Hey you guys?
1,Ross, What?
2,Monica," I know it’s last minute, but we decided to have a Halloween party."
3,Phoebe, Oh good! (And there’s general excitement.)
4,Monica," And everybody has to wear costumes. (And there’s general
disconcertment.) Come on! It’ll be fun!"
5,Ross," Well, I’ll-I’ll be there. I mean I have to wear a costume to all
my classes that day anyway so…"
6,Rachel, Please tell me you’re not gonna dress up like a dinosaur.
7,Ross, (exhales sarcastically) Not two years in a row.
8,Joey," Look, I’ll come to the party but I’m not dressing up."
9,Monica, You have to!
10,Joey," No way! Look, Halloween is so stupid! Dressing up, pretending to be
someone you’re not…"
11,Chandler, You’re an actor!
12,Monica," So Ross, are you gonna bring Mona?"
13,Ross," Yeah. Yeah, I think I will."
14,Joey, That hot girl from their wedding?
15,Ross, Yeah.
16,Joey," Well hey-hey if she needs any idea for costumes, she could be a bikini
model, or a slutty nurse, or a sexy cheerleader huh—Ooh-ooh, Leatherface from The
Texas Chainsaw Massacre—No-no-no! Slutty Leatherface."
17,Phoebe, Now wasn’t Joey hitting on her at the wedding too?
18,Ross," That’s right! He was hitting on her, and I got her. I guess
the better man won. (To Joey) Please don’t take her from me."
21,Phoebe," Ursula! (Ursula turns, smiles, and continues walking.) Wait! Err-err,
it’s me! Phoebe!"
23,Phoebe," Wait a second! So, what’s new with you?"
25,Phoebe, What?!
27,Phoebe," Huh. Okay. Well, I’m really happy for you. (Starts to walk away.)"
29,Phoebe, Really?
31,Phoebe," Yeah. Okay. Umm, y’know, my friends are having a Halloween party
tonight at my old apartment so, you could come. Maybe I could meet the guy you’re
marrying."
33,Phoebe," By the way, it’s a costume party."
35,Phoebe, (looks down) No. But thanks. (Walks away.)
37,Rachel, Hi!
38,Monica, Wait! You’re supposed to wear a costume!
39,Rachel," I am! I am a woman who spent a lot of money on a dress and she wants to
wear it, because soon she won’t be able to fit into it."
40,Monica, Oh. 
41,Rachel, Ahh!
42,Monica," I’m Catwoman, who wants to borrow the dress when you’re too
big for it."
43,Rachel, Okay.
46,Rachel," Oh! Oh! Can I give out the candy? I really want to be with the kids
right now. Y’know, ever since I got pregnant I-I have the strongest maternal
instincts."
48,Rachel," (to them) Just a minute!!! (She takes the candy and opens the door to
two parents, a witch, a clown, and a cowgirl.) Look at you guys! Wow! You are a very scary
witch. (Gives her candy.)"
50,Rachel, And you are a very funny clown. (Gives him candy.)
52,Rachel," (to the cowgirl) And you are so in style right now. Y’know, I work
at Ralph Lauren and the whole fall line has got this like equestrian theme going
on. I don’t suppose you saw the cover of British Vogue, but…"
54,Rachel," Yeah. Sure. (Throws some in her bag and she walks away as Phoebe,
dressed as Supergirl walks up and eyes Monica who eyes her back.)"
55,Phoebe," Ah, Catwoman. So we meet again."
56,Monica, So we do Supergirl.
57,Phoebe," No, it’s me. Phoebe!"
58,Chandler," (entering from the bedroom wearing a big, pink bunny costume) Monica!
Can I talk to you for a second? Listen, I appreciate you getting me the costume…"
59,Rachel," (To Monica) Oh, you did this to him?"
60,Monica," What?! I thought he’d love it! His favorite kid's book was the Velveteen
Rabbit!"
61,Chandler, The Velveteen Rabbit was brown and white!
62,Monica," Well, it was either a pink bunny or no bunny at all."
63,Chandler, No bunny at all!! Always no bunny at all!!!
64,Joey, (entering) Hey!
65,Monica, You didn’t dress up either?!
66,Joey," Yes I did! I’m Chandler. (Looks at Chandler) Dude, what happened?"
67,Chandler, How is that me?
68,Joey," Okay. I’m Chandler (makes a growling/gurgling sound at the end and
the girls laugh.)"
69,Phoebe, (To Chandler) That is so you!
70,Chandler, When have I ever done that?!
71,Joey, When have I ever done that?! (And does the sound again.)
74,Rachel," Oh! (Opens the door to reveal a ballerina) Well you’re just the
prettiest ballerina I’ve ever seen."
76,Rachel, Oh wow! That deserves another piece of candy.
78,Rachel," Well, I have to say that earns tutu pieces of candy."
80,Rachel," Ohh… Oh, honey here. Take it all. (Pours the entire large bowl into
her bag and closes the door.) Monica! We need more candy?"
81,Monica, What?! There’s only been like four kids.
82,Rachel," Yeah I know, but one of them just said that she loved me so I just gave
her everything."
83,Phoebe, No wonder your pregnant.
84,Ross, (entering) Hey! (He’s wearing a costume as well.)
85,Rachel, Hey.
86,Monica, What are you supposed to be?
87,Ross," Remember the Russian satellite, Sputnik? (They all look at him.) Well,
I’m a potato or a…spud. And these are my antennae. (Points to the colander with
an old TV antenna glued on top that he’s wearing.) So Sputnik, becomes…
(They’re still confused) Spud-nik. Spudnik!"
88,Chandler, Wow! I don’t have the worst costume anymore!
89,Joey," (sees Ross) Hey all right, Ross came as doody."
90,Ross," No, I-I’m not doody."
91,Monica," No, space doody!"
94,Phoebe," Okay, I will. But right after you tell me who the hell you are."
96,Phoebe, Ursula’s fiancée?
98,Phoebe, Yeah.
100,Phoebe, Yeah.
102,Phoebe, My mother killed herself.
104,Phoebe," No-no! That’s okay, we’ll just start over. Okay? Hi! I’m
Phoebe."
106,Phoebe, Why are you looking at me like that?
108,Phoebe," Okay. (Hands him a napkin.) So, what are you?"
110,Phoebe, (laughs) No I-I meant your costume.
112,Phoebe, I love the second grade!
114,Phoebe," Yeah! It’s so much better than first grade when you don’t know
what’s going on and definitely better than third grade. Y’know with all
the politics and mind games."
116,Phoebe," Umm, I’m a masseuse…by day. (Stands with her hands on her hips
like a Supergirl pose.)"
118,Phoebe," No I’m having fun. I’m really—And I’m really-really
excited for you and Ursula."
120,Phoebe, Thank you.
122,Monica, Hey Joey?
123,Joey, Yeah.
124,Monica, You read comic books right?
125,Joey, Exclusively.
126,Monica," Who do you think would win in a fight, Catwoman or Supergirl?"
127,Joey," Catwoman, hands down."
128,Monica, Yeah…
129,Joey," But between you and Phoebe, I’d have to give the edge to Phoebe."
130,Monica, What?! Really?!
131,Joey," Are you kiddin’? Phoebe lived on the street. Okay? Plus, she’s
got this crazy temper. She—She’s not standing right behind me is she?"
132,Monica," No you’re fine. (Joey checks anyway.) All right well, do you think
I could take Rachel?"
133,Joey, I’m not sure.
134,Monica," What?! Come on I am tough! Punch me right here! (Her stomach) As hard as
you can!"
135,Joey," Will you relax?! What are you taking this so seriously for? It
doesn’t matter."
136,Monica," Oh really? Okay? Well what would you say if I told you that,
y’know, Ross or Chandler could beat you up?"
137,Joey," I would say, ""Woman, please!"""
138,Phoebe," (walking over) Hey. Ursula’s fiancée is really sweet!
He’s a teacher, he does all this volunteer work. Y’know normally y’know, I
don’t like really sweaty guys. But this one? I could just mop him up!"
139,Monica," Oh my God, Phoebe!"
140,Phoebe, What?
141,Monica, You’re getting a crush on your sister’s fiancée.
142,Phoebe, No I’m not! You are!
143,Joey, (To Monica) Here comes the temper.
146,Rachel," Hi! Y’know what honey, we’re actually out of candy right now.
But someone just went out to get some and I have been giving out money but I’m
out of that too. Hey, can I write you a check?"
148,Rachel," Okay, what’s your name?"
150,Rachel," Okay, I’m just gonna write this out to cash."
152,Rachel, Hey Mona!
153,Chandler, Oh! Hi!
155,Chandler," Joey’s gonna be thrilled! He was hoping you’d come by as a
slutty nurse."
157,Chandler," You’d think that would embarrass me, but you see I’m maxed
out."
158,Ross, Hey!
160,Ross, You made it!
162,Ross," Well, I’m a spud…"
164,Ross, Yes!
165,Chandler, (To Ross) Marry her.
167,Joey," Okay, here’s a good one for ya. Who do think would win in a fight
between Ross and Chandler."
168,Monica, I can’t answer that! Chandler’s my husband.
169,Joey, So Ross?
170,Monica, Yeah.
173,Phoebe," Hello handsome. (Sees Ursula over her shoulder) Oh God. (Walks away in
shame as they kiss.) Oh look at you two. So when did you guys meet?"
175,Phoebe, Two weeks? That’s it?
177,Phoebe, Oh really?
179,Phoebe, Huh? (Ursula motions for Phoebe to keep quiet.)
181,Phoebe," Peace Corps, really? (Ursula motions, ""I don’t know."")"
187,Chandler, Howdy doody.
188,Ross," That’s funny. Yeah. Y’know you’re the funniest man here in
a pink bunny costume his wife made him wear."
189,Chandler," Oh relax man, relax. You’re looking a little flushed."
190,Joey," (To Monica) Hey-hey-hey, I think we might find out the answer to our
question."
191,Chandler, What question?
192,Joey," Monica and I were talking about who could kick whose ass in a fight, you
or Ross?"
193,Chandler, There’s no question.
194,Joey, So you think Ross too?
196,Chandler, (To Monica) You picked Ross?!
197,Monica," Ross is really strong! Okay, he’s the strongest out of all three of
you! (Joey looks at her.) Except for Joey."
198,Chandler, I cannot believe you didn’t pick me.
199,Ross," Uh, in her defense, she’s right. I am stronger. I would destroy you."
200,Chandler," Oh really?! You think you’re stronger? Why don’t you prove
it? (He pushes Ross who starts to fall backwards until Mona catches him.)"
201,Ross, Oh I’ll prove it! I’ll prove it like a theorem!! 
203,Monica," Wait-wait!! Okay, stop it! Stop it! Stop! (Breaks it up.) Now listen, no
one’s gonna fight in this apartment."
204,Joey," Hey Monica! (Grabs her and pulls her into the living room.) People came to
see a fight, let’s give ‘em what they came for!"
206,Joey, Yeah. Listen to the slutty nurse.
207,Chandler, (To Ross) You’re going down.
208,Ross, Oh yeah? You’re going further down! Downtown!
209,Joey," Seriously guys, the trash talk is embarrassing."
212,Rachel," Oh Gunther! You brought candy! Thank you so much for picking this up!
You are so sweet."
214,Rachel," Honey, someday you are gonna make some man the luckiest guy in the
world."
217,Rachel," Gotta go! (Opens the door to a boy in a cape.) Hi! Wow! There you go!
(Hands him some candy.)"
219,Rachel," Oh yeah, we were but umm, now we’ve got candy."
221,Rachel," Well, that-that’s not your choice. Happy Halloween!"
223,Rachel," Well is it fair that all you did was put on a cape and I gotta give you
free stuff?"
225,Rachel, You shut up!
228,Rachel," Uh, I think I just did. And uh-oh, here it comes again. Shut up!"
229,Joey, Rach?
230,Rachel," (To Joey) Yeah I know—I’m good—I got it! (Joey slowly
backs away.) (To the boy) Now wait a minute, I’ve got one more thing I have to say to
you…oh right! Shut up!"
232,Rachel," No! Wait no! Shut up—I mean don’t cry! Let me get my
checkbook! (Grabs her checkbook and runs after him.)"
234,Monica," (To Chandler) Look honey, you don’t have to do this, okay?
It’s the strength you have inside that means the most to me. You’re loyal,
you’re honest, and you have integrity! That’s the kind of strength that I want
in the man that I love!"
235,Chandler, That means nothing to me. (To Ross) Come on!
237,Phoebe, Hi liar!
239,Phoebe," Y’know the only reason he’s marrying you is because he thinks
all the things you were saying about yourself were true."
241,Phoebe, But they’re not!
243,Phoebe, Why are you lying to him?
252,Phoebe, You too. And Ursula?! It was really nice meeting you tonight!!
253,Joey," (entering) Pheebs come on! Bunny vs. Doody! We’re waiting! (They go
inside.) (To Chandler and Ross.) Okay. Okay guys, one match, winner take all. (They grasp
each other’s hand in preparation for battle.) Oh wait-wait! What does the winner get?"
254,Ross, Pride.
255,Chandler, And dignity.
256,Joey," (laughing) Okay, if you say so. All right, ready? Set! Go!"
260,Joey, Or equally weak.
261,Monica, (To Phoebe) Oh God!
262,Phoebe, Hmm?
263,Monica, Chandler’s making his sex face.
265,Ross," (To Chandler) So, you gettin’ tired?"
266,Chandler, Nope! I can do this all day.
267,Ross, Yeah? Me too. (Pause) Gettin’ a little tired though.
268,Chandler," God, I’m exhausted."
269,Ross," Look this is starting to look really bad for me. Okay? Mona, Mona’s
standing right over there. (Looks behind him.) Oh God, she’s talking to Joey! You
gotta let me win!"
270,Chandler," No way! If anything you’ve gotta let me win! My wife thinks
I’m a wimp!"
271,Ross," Hey, at least you have a wife! I-I keep getting divorces and knockin’
people up! And I’m dressed as doody."
272,Chandler, You’re Spudnik.
273,Ross," Come on, who are we kidding? I’m doody. Please? She’s
watchin’."
274,Chandler, Fine. (He lets Ross win.) Oh no! 
275,Ross, (celebrating) Oh yeah!
277,Joey, (to her) You’re a weird lady.
279,Phoebe, Oh.
281,Phoebe," Sure it does. Yeah, yeah."
283,Phoebe," Umm listen, I don’t think…I don’t think I’m gonna
make it to the wedding. So I just want to wish you all the luck in the world."
285,Phoebe, Okay I can’t let you do this! She’s lying to you.
287,Phoebe," She is lying! And I bet I can prove it. Excuse me. (She grabs
Ursula’s purse and starts going through it and finds some papers.) Okay. Okay.
Yeah—Not a prayer chain, but what looks like a detailed drawing of a bank floor plan.
(Holds up her nametag.) Okay, here’s the nametag from the restaurant where she works
as a waitress! Not a teacher, a waitress. All right, here’s her driver license, this
oughta be good, she always lies about this. How old did she say she was?"
289,Phoebe," Oh, I almost don’t want to show this. (Hands it to him.) Just
remember I’m a minute younger."
291,Phoebe," No. You’re not, you’re not stupid."
293,Phoebe," That’s good, you should be impulsive and you should be romantic.
Just…you did it with the wrong person. (He looks at her.) What?"
297,Phoebe," Yeah, you should. (They shake hands.)"
301,Joey, Hey!
302,Rachel," Hey! Well, I had to give the kid fifty bucks to stop crying."
303,Joey, That’s not so bad.
304,Rachel," No, I also had to go to a couple houses with him as his girlfriend. Oh,
I am just awful with children!"
305,Joey," Come on! You’re good with kids. They’re just crazy on Halloween.
Y’know, they’re all greedy and hopped up on sugar!"
306,Rachel, Really? You think that’s all it is? 
307,Joey," Absolutely! Halloween is the worst. Except for Christmas…and their
birthdays. Kinda get a little crazy during the summer too. And anytime they’re hungry
or sleepy. Y’know, kids are tough. Good luck with that. (Walks away.)"
310,Monica," Look, I wanted to tell I’m-I’m sorry you lost."
311,Chandler," Listen, I’ve got a secret for ya. I let him win."
312,Monica, (laughs) Is that a secret or a lie.
313,Chandler," No, I let him win—Ross!"
314,Ross, Yeah?
315,Chandler, Would you tell her I let you win please?
316,Ross," Oh. Yeah. (Sarcastically) Uh Chandler let me win. No,
Chandler’s really strong. Oh my arm is so sore. Oh nurse! (Waddles over to Mona.)"
317,Chandler, I am strong! I’ll show you! (He sits down at the table.)
318,Monica, Chandler please!
319,Chandler, Oh what’s the matter? Are you scared?
320,Monica, Let’s go big bunny!
322,Chandler," Okay. 1…2…3—Go! (Once again he’s at a stalemate,
but this time he’s in pain.) (Pause) I’m gonna kill myself!"
0,Monica, Hey.
1,Chandler, Hey.
3,Monica," Oh my God! You cleaned! (Gasps) Look at these floors! You did the
windows! Oh, I have been begging you for months and you did! You cleaned! And nagging
works!"
4,Chandler," Y’know uh, I didn’t actually do this."
5,Monica," Oh no, was I cleaning in my sleep again?"
6,Chandler," No, it wasn’t you."
7,Monica, Well then who?
8,Chandler, I got a maid. Yay!
9,Monica," (shocked) I hope by maid you mean mistress, because if some other woman
was here cleaning then…"
10,Chandler," Uh honey, I know you don’t like to relinquish control…"
11,Monica," Oh, relinquish is just a fancy word for lose!"
12,Chandler," Look, she’s really nice. Okay? And she mentioned that she adored
the way that you arranged the sponges."
13,Monica, Did she really say that?
14,Chandler," Yes, I distinctly remember ‘cause I thought it was a joke. Now
just give her a chance, okay?"
15,Monica," Fine, I can do it. (Gets anxious.) Whew."
16,Chandler, What’s the matter?
17,Monica," Well, usually when I’m this anxious, I clean!"
20,Phoebe," (looking around) Who’s cell phone is that? It’s just so
annoying; everywhere you go."
21,Ross, I think it’s coming from your bag.
22,Phoebe, (checks) I never get calls!! (Answers the phone) Hello?
24,Phoebe," Oh my God Eric hi! Wait, how’d you get this number?"
26,Phoebe, Wow! What an incredible violation—and wonderful surprise.
28,Phoebe, Oh you did? (To Rachel) He did it! He did it!
29,Rachel, Wow! What did he do?
30,Phoebe, Shhh! I’m talking.
32,Phoebe," Are you asking me out? ‘Cause it would be kinda weird since you
just broke up with my sister."
34,Phoebe," No! Wait! I was just saying that so you’d think I was a good
person. Fight for me."
36,Phoebe," Not great, but we can work on it at lunch. Okay, I can be at your
apartment in two hours."
38,Phoebe," I’ve got friends too. Okay, bye."
41,Phoebe," Oh my God! I’m going out with Eric! Ooh, this day is really gonna
be so much better than I thought it was gonna be. Oh Ross, I can’t make lunch.
(Exits.)"
42,Ross, So apparently I’m available for lunch.
43,Rachel, I can’t. I’m busy. I’m apartment hunting.
44,Ross, You’re moving?
45,Rachel," Yeah, I can’t live with Joey once the baby comes. I don’t want
my child’s first words to be, (in a baby’s voice) ""How you
doin’?"""
46,Ross, So does-does Joey know you’re moving?
47,Rachel," Well, I haven’t discussed it with him yet, but I know he’s
gonna be relieved. Last week, he brought this girl over and I started talking to her about
morning sickness and then I showed her pictures from my pregnancy book."
48,Ross, That’s not really porn.
49,Rachel, Not so much.
50,Ross," Hey, y’know what and if you’re looking for a place? I just heard
in the elevator this morning that a woman in my building died."
51,Rachel, Oh my God! Was she old? Does she have a view?
52,Ross," Well I don’t know, but how-how great would that be huh? You living in
my building. I could help take care of the baby. I can come over whenever I want. (Rachel
looks at him.) With your permission."
53,Rachel, Yeah that would really be great.
54,Ross, Yeah.
55,Rachel," Well can we see it?! Oh maybe we shouldn’t. I mean if she just died
this morning out of respect."
56,Ross, Yeah. No. No you’re right. 
58,Rachel, Shall we?
59,Ross, Yeah.
63,Ross, Hi. I’m Ross Geller. I live in the building.
64,Rachel," And I’m Rachel, an admirer of the building."
65,Ross," I-I heard about Mrs. Verhoeven passing away and I’m so sorry for your
loss."
67,Ross, What?
69,Ross," Oh, thank God!"
71,Rachel, Ahh.
73,Ross," Of course! Uh yeah, she and I would talk all the time in-in (Rachel pokes
her head in and starts to look around) the laundry room. (Pushes Rachel out of the way.)"
75,Ross, Y’know I would it’s just painful.
76,Rachel, So she’s really not dead.
78,Rachel," Hmm. Do you think—Could you tell me if she’s hanging in, in a
one bedroom or a two?"
81,Monica," Oh well umm, I make it myself! It’s two parts ammonia and one part
lemon juice. And now the secret ingredient is…y’know what? We just met."
83,Monica, (To Chandler) I love her.
85,Monica, Okay. (As Brenda exits Monica notices something.)
86,Chandler, See? I told you.
87,Monica, She stole my jeans!
88,Chandler, (pause) What?
89,Monica, I have been looking for them all week and she is wearing them!
90,Chandler," So she stole your pants and then she came back and wore them in front
of you?"
91,Monica, Don’t you see? It’s the perfect crime!
92,Chandler, She must’ve been planning this for years!
93,Monica," I will prove it to you! Okay? About a week ago I was wearing those jeans
and I dropped a pen in my lap and it left an ink stain on the crotch. Now when she comes
back I will find it and show you that stain!"
94,Chandler," Honey, isn’t it possible that the company that sold the jeans
made more than just the one pair?"
95,Monica, I guess.
96,Chandler," So, shouldn’t we go give her the benefit of the doubt before we
go…snooping around her crotch?"
97,Monica, Fine. I’m just glad I didn’t give her my secret ingredient.
98,Chandler," Out of curiosity, what is your secret ingredient?"
99,Monica, Yeah! (Laughs.)
101,Phoebe, Hi!
103,Phoebe," Yeah, me too. Not in the shaky angry way you are though."
105,Phoebe, Oh.
107,Phoebe, Yeah. (Covers her face with her hand.) Yeah.
109,Phoebe, Maybe this is too weird.
111,Phoebe, No don’t tear out your eyes!!
113,Phoebe," Oh, yeah try that. (He finishes and looks at her.) So, is that better?"
115,Phoebe," Look Eric, turn around. (He does so.) Look, I like you, but it
shouldn’t be this hard. Y’know? This is our first date y’know? First
dates are supposed to be about excitement and electricity and ‘Ooh, he just touched
my hand, did he mean to touch my hand?’ and y’know first kisses and…(He
kisses her)…second kisses. (Motions for him to kiss her again which he does and they
start to make out.)"
117,Ross," Thanks for the coffee, or bedankt voor de koffie, Gunter. (He translates
that phrase into Dutch.)"
119,Ross," Yeah, we’re done."
121,Ross, Ezel? Ezel? Ezel? (Looks it up in his book.)
122,Joey," (entering) Hey Ross! Listen, do you want to go see that new Imax movie on
tide pools?"
123,Ross, Really?!
124,Joey," (laughs) No. But I got Knicks tickets for you, me, and Chandler."
125,Ross, Sweet!
126,Joey," All right, well finish your coffee; let’s go."
127,Ross, Okay I-I just have to stop by my place first.
128,Joey," To tape the game? You do this every time Ross, you’re not
gonna be on TV!"
129,Ross," No-no, I-I have to see if this apartment became available."
130,Joey," Oh, you’re switching apartments?"
131,Ross," It’s not for me, it’s for Rachel."
132,Joey, But Rachel has an apartment.
133,Ross," Yeah, but when the baby comes she’s gonna want to move."
134,Joey, She is?
135,Ross," Yeah, you didn’t expect her to live there with a baby did you?"
136,Joey, I guess I didn’t really think about it.
137,Ross," (finds the word in the book) Ezel! (Reads the translation.) Hey Gunther!
You’re an ezel!"
139,Ross, Damnit!
141,Monica, Nice jeans!
143,Monica, Oh. (Holds on to it.) (To herself) You’re not gettin’ it.
146,Monica," Oh, I fell asleep."
148,Monica," Oh, will you do the top of the cabinets? That’ll really work up
your appetite for lunch."
151,Monica, Hello.
153,Monica," I’m sorry. I’ve never had a maid before, is this not okay?"
156,Rachel, Hey!
157,Joey, Hey!
158,Rachel, How was the game?
159,Joey," Oh, okay. I…I ate way too much."
160,Rachel, Oh.
161,Joey," Ooh. (Notices the pizza, grabs a slice, and takes a bite.) So umm, I was
talkin’ to Ross and he said you were looking for a new place."
162,Rachel," Oh yeah! Hopefully across the street if certain Dutch people would just
let go."
163,Joey, I was kinda hoping you’d stay.
164,Rachel," Oh but Joey, I have to go. There’s no room for a baby here."
165,Joey," No room? It’s a baby. It’s like this big. (Holds his hands about
a foot apart.) Y’know, I mean you-you could you could put it over here. (A desk.)
Or-or-or we could put it right here. (The chair.) Aw, it’s cute, right? Or-or we
could put it over here. (By the bathroom door.) You wouldn’t even notice it.
Where’s the baby? (Mumbles that it’s over in the corner.)"
166,Rachel," Honey, it’s not just a matter of where you put it. I mean a baby
changes everything. They cry all the time. I mean imagine bringing home some girl and
trying to score when there’s a screaming baby around."
167,Joey, I could use a challenge! It’s getting pretty easy.
168,Rachel," Honey, it’s so sweet that you want me to stay, but I-I can’t
do that to you. I mean it would disrupt your entire life."
169,Joey," I love living with you so much. I just wish things didn’t have to
change."
170,Rachel, I know.
171,Joey, Y’know I blame Ross for this.
172,Rachel, I do too a little bit.
173,Joey," I’m gonna miss you, you’re the hottest roommate I ever had."
175,Phoebe," Ooh, oh no! I have to go! I have a massage appointment."
177,Phoebe," No, I got in trouble for that before. I’ll see you later."
179,Phoebe," Really? That’s the thing I’m worse at! You’ll see.
(Exits.)"
181,Chandler, (entering) Hi!
182,Monica," Hey! Umm, I think Brenda needs a raise."
183,Chandler, How come?
184,Monica, Because I put my head between her legs.
185,Chandler, To see her pants?
186,Monica, They’re my pants!
187,Chandler, Are you sure? Did you see the stain?
188,Monica, No! I was just getting into position and then everything went dark.
189,Chandler," God! She is not stealing from us! Okay, will you let this go?"
190,Monica," Fine. (Brenda comes in to use the bathroom and adjusts her pink bra
strap on the way.) She’s wearing my bra!"
191,Chandler, Oh dear God!
192,Monica, My pink flowered bra! I recognize the strap!
193,Chandler, And yet you don’t recognize that you’re crazy.
194,Monica," Here’s the plan! Okay? I’m going to leave you get a look at
Brenda’s bra!"
195,Chandler, Here’s another plan…No!
196,Monica, I would do it but she thinks I’m attracted to her!
197,Chandler, Why?
198,Monica," Did you not hear where my head was? Come on! Come on we’re a
team! We’re in this together!"
199,Chandler, I fear a jury will see it the same way!
200,Monica," Do this for me! Come on, I catch you looking at woman’s breasts all
the time!"
201,Chandler, You see that?
202,Monica, Do you see this? (Mimics him drooling over a woman’s breasts.)
203,Chandler," All right. Yes. Okay. I get your point. But if it’s not your bra
will you just let the woman clean the apartment?!"
204,Monica," Yes! Absolutely. Okay? Look, you’ll know it’s mine because on
the right cup, the lacey part, there’s a very noticeable rip."
205,Chandler, You need new clothes.
207,Ross, Hi. How is she?
209,Ross," (happily) Oh. (Realizes then sadly) Oh. Well I uh, I brought her some
bloemen. (Flowers in Dutch.)"
211,Ross, Oh I don’t know that it would.
213,Ross, All right then. (Follows her in and checks the place out.)
215,Phoebe, (entering) Hey!
217,Phoebe, Hey! (Jumps on the bed with him.) Can we pick up where we left off?
219,Phoebe, Why?
221,Phoebe, What sex?
223,Phoebe, We didn’t have sex.
225,Phoebe, (simultaneously as Eric) Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew!
227,Phoebe, You-you…you had sex with Ursula?!
229,Phoebe, You didn’t notice she was wearing different clothes?!
231,Phoebe, Oh. Ew! Ew! Ew! Ugh! Y’know what? This is too weird.
233,Phoebe, So I guess this is it.
235,Phoebe," Yeah, so do you."
238,Chandler, I’m leaning. This is where I lean.
240,Chandler, Brenda a bee!
242,Chandler," Yes! It’s flown into your blouse and you’d better undo your
buttons lest it sting you!"
244,Chandler, You do?
246,Chandler," I totally understand. (They both laugh.) Can I just see your
bra?"
248,Rachel, Hi!
249,Monica, (looking at Rachel’s jeans) Where did you get those jeans?!
250,Rachel, You gave them to me!
251,Monica, No I didn’t!
252,Rachel," All right, I took them. But I figured it would be okay because you got a
big ink stain on the crotch."
253,Monica, Oh no! Did you take my bra too?!
254,Rachel, What bra?
255,Monica, The pink one with the flowers?!
256,Rachel," You mean the one that you’re wearing? (Adjusts Monica’s pink
bra strap as Monica looks down her shirt.)"
258,Monica, Sounds about right.
260,Rachel, What is this?
261,Joey," Hey! Uh, this is just to give you an idea. Okay well, we can put screens
here, (In front of the crib.) so that the baby has privacy, and-and-and maybe a mobile
over the crib. And uh—Oh look! Here’s a baby monitor (Holds it up), which until
the baby comes we can use as walkie-talkies. Huh?"
262,Rachel," You’re so sweet. (Notices something in the crib.) Oh my God! And
you gave the baby Hugsy! (A stuffed penguin wearing a ski jacket, goggles, and hat.)"
263,Joey," Ahhhhhhhhhhhh…. That-that-that’s really just to show where the
baby would go. Y’know why don’t I hold on to him so that there’s no
confusion? (Takes him back, sets him on the chair, and apologizes to him.)"
264,Rachel," But Joey the baby is going to be crying, it’s going to be loud."
265,Joey, I’m loud!
266,Rachel, It’s gonna be up all night!
267,Joey, I’m up all night!
268,Rachel, It’s gonna poop!
269,Joey, Hello!
270,Rachel, What about all the women you want to bring home?
271,Joey," Look, if I’m bringing home a woman who can’t stand being around
a baby, then maybe I don’t want to be with that woman! Or maybe we’ll just do it
in the bathroom of the club!"
272,Rachel," Joey, are you sure?"
273,Joey," Yeah! All right—Look, I know sometimes it’ll be hard, okay? But,
it’ll also be really…really great. Please Rachel! I-I-I really want you to stay."
274,Rachel, I want me to stay too.
275,Joey, Ohh!
276,Rachel, Thank you. (They hug.) Oh Joey and look at this crib! It’s so cute!
277,Joey, I know! I found it on the street.
278,Rachel, Are you serious—Really?! It’s in such good condition.
279,Joey, Yeah.
280,Rachel, Wow! Whoa-whoa what’s under the covers?
281,Joey, I don’t know.
282,Rachel, It’s moving.
283,Joey, Ew.
284,Rachel," It’s still—(Screams)—It’s got a tail! Get it out of
here! Get it out of here!!"
285,Joey, Ooh! Ah! Okay! (Quickly drags the crib outside.)
289,Ross," Well, the old lady died. And how do I know? Her dying wish was for one
last kiss. But I don’t care, (To Rachel) because you got the apartment. Yes!"
290,Rachel, Ewww. Yeah. Umm. I think I’m gonna stay here.
291,Joey, Isn’t that great?
292,Ross, (stutters looking for words) Ezels!!
0,Rachel, (coming from the bathroom) Hey Pheebs?
1,Phoebe, Huh?
2,Rachel," I’m having dinner with my dad tomorrow night, do you wanna come?"
3,Phoebe," Sure. Yeah, he’s kinda sexy."
4,Rachel," Oh no, no, I’ll be there too."
5,Phoebe," Okay so, we’ll just come up with some kind of signal if it’s
going well you can take off."
6,Rachel," No Phoebe! I just need you there for support. I haven’t told him
I’m pregnant yet."
7,Phoebe, Oh. Why not?
8,Rachel," ‘Cause I know he’s gonna flip out and I hate it when he’s
angry."
9,Phoebe," Oh Rachel, this is all so ‘Papa don’t preach.’"
10,Rachel," What Phoebe? Wait! One time he caught me smoking he said if he ever saw
me doing that again he’d make me eat the entire pack."
11,Phoebe," Wow! Oh well, I will be there! "
12,Rachel, Thank you.
13,Phoebe," Gosh. I’m not gonna let that man make you eat your baby. (They both
sit down by the rest of the gang and Phoebe recognizes a man by the window.) Oh. Hey! Who
is that guy? I think I know him."
14,Monica, (recognizing him and panicking) No you don’t!
15,Rachel, (panicking) No you don’t.
16,Phoebe," Oh my God!!! Monica!! He’s the stripper from your bachelorette
party!!"
17,Chandler, Her what?!!
18,Phoebe, Your secret bachelorette party…
19,Chandler, You had a bachelorette party?!
20,Phoebe, She untied his G-string with her teeth. (Pause) Somebody stop me!
21,Chandler," I thought we weren’t gonna have bachelor/bachelorette parties!
Y’know, we agreed that it was a silly tradition."
22,Joey, It’s a grand tradition!
23,Monica," I’m sorry, they surprised me. There was nothing I could do!"
24,Rachel, Well you could’ve untied it with your hands.
25,Joey," This is so unfair! The one thing I wanted to do was throw my best friend a
bachelor party, but no, I wasn’t allowed to. All I got was a stupid steak dinner!"
26,Chandler, You went home with the waitress.
27,Joey," Oh yeah, that was a pretty good night."
28,Chandler," I can’t believe you didn’t tell me! You know that the
two pillars of marriage are openness and honesty!"
29,Monica," Ugh, I knew giving you that book was gonna come back and bite me
in the ass!"
33,Phoebe," Oh, I-I don’t eat meat."
35,Phoebe," Yeah, I don’t eat that either."
37,Rachel, Well actually umm…
42,Rachel," (To Phoebe) In case you didn’t notice, that is a scary man."
43,Phoebe," He’s right though, the ’74 is absolute piss."
44,Rachel," This was such a huge mistake. I can’t tell him Phoebe. I
can’t, I can’t, I can’t, I can’t…"
45,Phoebe, Rachel!
46,Rachel," No it’s okay, this is what’s gonna happen. I’m gonna wait
a couple years and then the baby will tell him."
47,Phoebe," Why, so he can get mad at the baby?"
48,Rachel," Hey, that is the…baby’s problem. (Dr. Green returns.) Oh,
everything okay with the waiter?"
50,Rachel," Well… Umm, I got TiVo."
52,Phoebe, It’s slang for pregnant.
53,Rachel, Phoebe!
55,Rachel," Well uh, yes and no. Except not no. So to sum it up, yeah."
57,Rachel," No, it’s Ross. It’s Ross. You like Ross. (He just shakes his
head.) Oh daddy, I hope you’re okay with all of this. I mean think about it, this is
a good thing. You’re gonna—This is your first grandchild! You’re gonna be a
poppy!"
59,Rachel, Yeah.
61,Rachel, Who?
63,Rachel, February 2nd!
67,Ross," Oh thanks. Although it kinda seemed like you were falling asleep there a
little."
69,Ross," Yeah, a lot of my students do that."
71,Ross," Okay, I-I’ll see you tonight."
73,Ross," Okay, bye. "
76,Chandler, My God! You must be good in bed!
77,Joey," So uh, you and Mona, been a while now. How’s it going?"
78,Ross," Ah, it’s good. It’s going good. I mean, we get along great.
She’s, she’s so…"
79,Joey, Hot?
80,Ross," Well, I was gonna say sweet, but yeah-huh!"
81,Chandler, She’s okay with Rachel and the baby?
82,Ross," Well I…I haven’t actually told her yet. I don’t want to
scare her off, y’know?"
83,Chandler," Well, you have to honest with her! Otherwise you may think that
you’re going down the same path, but you’re really going down different ones."
84,Joey, I’m gonna take that book and beat you to death with it.
85,Monica," (entering) Oh my God! You are gonna love me so much! I felt really bad
about the whole bachelorette party thing, so tonight you’re gonna have a bachelor
party."
86,Chandler, What?
87,Monica," Yeah, I got this number from this guy at work and I hired a stripper to
come dance for you. Am I going in the wife hall of fame or what?!"
88,Chandler," Honey! That’s crazy! I don’t want you to get me a
stripper…"
89,Joey, Will you let the lady talk?!
90,Monica," Come on! Come on, it’ll be fun! It’ll make me feel so much
better."
91,Chandler," Look, I appreciate it, but uh, it’s a little creepy. Y’know?
I’m not a bachelor anymore."
92,Monica," So don’t think of it as a bachelor party, think of it as a…a
two month anniversary present."
93,Ross," Sure, one year is paper, but two months is lapdance! (Joey nods his
agreement.)"
94,Monica, Please! I feel so bad! Just watch the hot woman get naked!
95,Chandler, All right fine! But I’m only doing this for you!
96,Joey, Yeah!
97,Chandler, And Joey.
98,Monica," Thank you. All right, now who else do you want to invite?"
99,Chandler," Ah, no-no-no just Ross. Ross and Joey is embarrassing enough."
100,Ross," Uh actually, sorry I can’t even make it. I’m seeing Mona again
tonight."
101,Chandler," I understand who would cancel an actual date to go to a fake bachelor
party?"
102,Joey, (on cell phone) I’m sorry I gotta cancel tonight baby…
104,Phoebe," I’m sorry I won’t be able to make it to your imaginary
wedding, but I’m really busy that day. Yeah, I already have a unicorn baptism
and a leprechaun bar mitzvah."
105,Rachel," I know. I know. I panicked, I panicked. I didn’t want him to start
yelling at me like I was some ’74 Latour. "
106,Phoebe, It’s Lafite. The ’74 Latour is actually drinking quite nicely.
107,Rachel," All right here he comes. I’m gonna do this, I’m gonna tell
him, I’m gonna be strong."
109,Rachel, Yeah?
111,Rachel," Really?! The Plaza?!! Oh daddy!! (Hugs him and Phoebe glares at
her.) Right. Daddy, I need to talk to you. Please, sit down."
113,Rachel, There’s not gonna be a wedding. Ross and I are not getting married.
115,Rachel, I’m sorry daddy.
117,Rachel," Oh now daddy, stay calm. Please."
119,Rachel," Yes. Yes, he says I’m damaged goods."
121,Joey," So you uh, nervous about getting married?"
122,Chandler, What are you doing?
123,Joey," Look, look let’s pretend it’s a real bachelor party. Okay?
Y’know? Before your wedding. Come on, it’ll be fun."
124,Chandler, Okay. I can’t believe tomorrow’s the big day.
125,Joey," How does it feel knowing you’re never gonna be with another woman
again huh? Knowing you’re gonna have to wake up to the same face everyday until you
finally have the sweet release of death."
126,Chandler," You’re right, this is more fun."
128,Joey," That’s her! Okay, come on! (They go over and open the door.)"
130,Chandler, Hi. (Joey blows on a noisemaker.)
132,Joey," Uh, that-that’s-that’s me!"
133,Chandler, That’s me.
134,Joey," Joey Tribbiani, a big fan."
136,Chandler," Yeah, yeah right over there."
138,Chandler, That was weird.
139,Joey, Why-why would she go in the bedroom?
142,Chandler, So she’s a…
143,Joey," Yeah, that’s one naked hooker!"
146,Ross, Uh that’s an eighteenth century Indian artifact from Calcutta.
148,Ross, So much more.
151,Ross," Aw forget it, it’s from Pier One. (There’s an angry knock
on the door.) Sorry. (Goes and opens the door to an irate Dr. Green.)"
153,Ross, Y’know this is actually not a great time for me.
158,Ross, Who did?!
160,Ross," Yes. Yes, yes I did. (To Mona) But-but it was, it was just a one night
thing. It meant nothing."
162,Ross," No! No sir umm, she means a lot to me. I mean, I care—I-I love
Rachel."
164,Ross," (to Mona) Oh but not that way. I mean…I mean I’m not in love
with her. I love her like a, like a friend."
166,Ross, (to Dr. Green) Hey! I offered to marry her!
168,Ross, (To Mona) But I didn’t want to.
171,Ross," I’m sorry. Dr. Green, Mona. Mona, Dr. Green."
173,Chandler, I can’t believe there is a naked hooker in there!
174,Joey," Wait! Wait! Maybe she’s a hooker and a stripper, but she got
confused about what she’s supposed to do."
175,Chandler," Could be. I mean technically she did strip, we just, we just missed
it. (Walks towards the bedroom.) Ma’am, are you also a stripper?"
177,Joey," Maybe Monica’s playing a joke on ya. Y’know? Getting her own
husband a hooker, that’s pretty funny."
178,Chandler," That is funny, maybe for my birthday she’ll murder someone."
179,Joey, I bet Ross was in on it too. I mean he was conveniently busy.
181,Chandler," Oh actually, I’d rather you…Yeah, go ahead. We’re gonna
have to burn that room down anyway."
184,Ross," I was going to tell you, but…"
186,Ross," Hey! I did not dump Rachel! (To Mona) Nor are we still together. (The
phone rings and Ross goes to answer it, only he’s trapped behind the apothecary table
by Dr. Green.) Can I just… (Dr. Green glares at him.) Why don’t we just let the
machine get that?"
187,Joey," (on machine) Hey Ross. It’s Joey. There’s a hooker over here and
we thought maybe you’d know something about it."
188,Ross," No! No! No! No! No! I-I-I-I—I need to, I need to lie down."
191,Monica, Yeah! Hey! Thanks for getting me that girl’s number.
193,Monica, My husband.
195,Monica, She’s a stripper.
197,Monica," Is that, is that what they call strippers sometimes?"
199,Monica," Oh my God Stu! I-I can’t believe you did this! Now are you
absolutely sure she’s a hooker?"
203,Joey, Maybe she meant to get you a hooker.
204,Chandler, Why would she do that?
205,Joey," Maybe she wants you to learn something. Huh? Now is there anything
you’re really bad at y’know, sexually?"
206,Chandler, This is the worst bachelor party ever!
208,Joey, In a minute!
209,Chandler, (To Joey) In a minute? What’s gonna happen in a minute?!
210,Joey," All right, all right maybe-maybe you should just ask her to leave."
211,Chandler, Why me?!
212,Joey, Hey! It’s your bachelor party.
213,Chandler, Which is why you should do it.
214,Joey, I don’t want to. You do it!
215,Chandler, You do it!
216,Joey, You do it!
217,Chandler," All right Rock, Paper, Scissors who has to tell the whore to leave!
(Joey smirks.) What?"
218,Joey, I miss this.
219,Chandler, I don’t think we’ve actually done this before!
220,Joey," No, I-I miss hanging out with you."
221,Chandler, Well we…we still hang out.
222,Joey," Not like we used to. Remember? You and me used to be inseparable.
Y’know now it’s like…things are different."
223,Chandler," Well y’know, things are different. I’m…I’m married
now."
224,Joey," Oh sure—And hey, don’t get me wrong, I am so happy for you guys.
I just…I miss…hanging out…just-just us, y’know?"
225,Chandler," Yeah, I miss that too. I tell you what; from now on we’ll make
time to hang out with each other."
226,Joey, You got it. Come here. (They hug and are observed by the hooker.)
228,Monica," (entering quickly) She’s a hooker! She’s a hooker! She’s
a… (Stops as she sees her.) Hi! Uh, we spoke on the phone. (Goes and shakes the
hooker’s hand.)"
230,Ross, So your dad dropped by. He’s a pleasant man!
231,Rachel, (quietly) Oh no…
232,Phoebe," I’d better go. (She goes and sits down in the La-Z-Boy E-cliner
3000, the chair that Sit magazine called chair of the year, and they both look at
her.) Just over here I don’t want to miss the fight."
233,Rachel," Ross I’m so sorry. Okay. I-I will promise I will straighten this
out with him tomorrow in person, or via e-mail."
234,Ross," I don’t care about your dad! I care about Mona! She was there and now
she’s totally freaked out!"
235,Rachel," Oh okay, I’ll fix that to. What’s her e-mail address?"
236,Ross, Rachel!
237,Rachel," All right, I promise. I’ll fix this. I swear.
I’ll-I’ll-I’ll-I’ll talk to her."
238,Ross, Okay!
239,Rachel, Okay.
240,Ross, Thank you!
241,Phoebe," That’s it?! You call that a fight? Come on! ""We were on a
break!"" ""No we weren’t!"" What happened to you two?!"
243,Ross, Thank you so much for coming back over.
245,Rachel," I know Mona, just hear me out. First of all, I’m so sorry about my
father yelling at you, but I heard you totally held your own. You’re gonna have to
tell me how you did that."
246,Ross, Focus.
247,Rachel," Okay. Um…But—Okay, yes Ross and I used to date. And yes we are
gonna have a baby. But we are definitely not getting back together."
249,Rachel, Oh we just—we drove each other crazy!
250,Ross, Yeah.
251,Rachel," I mean he was possessive, he was jealous, he could never just let the
little things go!"
252,Ross, Trying to date this woman.
253,Rachel," Right! But, none of that compared to how kind and-and how gentle and
thoughtful he is. (Rubbing his shoulder.)"
254,Ross, Probably shouldn’t touch me.
256,Rachel," I know, I get it, but Mona, what relationship is not complicated? I mean
we all have our baggage! You must too! Why else would you still be single? (Mona looks at
her.) I am so gonna leave right now. (Ross opens the door for her and she leaves.)"
257,Ross, Should I leave this open for you too?
259,Ross," Because what’s going on with Rachel has nothing to do with how I feel
about you."
261,Ross," I know and I was going to, but I thought it was better that you heard it
from Rachel’s father. Look I…I made a mistake, but it’s only because I
really, really like you. Really!"
263,Rachel," (entering) Forgot my purse! (Sees them kissing.) Oh, you guys made up.
(To Mona) He’s a good kisser isn’t he? (Ross goes to close the door on her.)
I’m going! (Quickly leaves and Ross locks the door.)"
265,Monica," I swear I didn’t know she was a hooker! I mean wh—Did you let
her smoke in here?"
266,Chandler," Her ass print is still on your grandmother’s quilt, do you really
want to talk about smoking?"
267,Monica," Y’know what? I’m gonna make this up to you. I promised you a
stripper (turns on the radio), and you’re gonna get a stripper. (She starts to
strip.)"
268,Chandler, Monica! Wait!
269,Monica, What?
270,Chandler, (puts on his crown) Carry on.
272,Monica," Ooh, these tennis shoes are so tight. I think I’ll take them off.
(Goes to do so.)"
273,Chandler, Could you not narrate?
274,Monica," Gotcha sailor. (Kicks one of her shoes off and it lands in the kitchen
knocking something down, but she continues to strip.)"
278,Phoebe," (entering, quietly) Wow, you told your dad the truth."
279,Rachel, About an hour ago.
280,Phoebe, Wanna go see a movie?
281,Rachel," Yes! (She gets up and sets the phone on the counter without hanging it
up.) Bye daddy. (Phoebe and her leave.)"
283,Joey," (on phone) Hey! I do too think about the consequences of my decisions!
(Listens) What gives you the right to… (Listens) Go to hell! (Hangs up the phone and
opens the fridge.) Stupid guy on my phone."
0,Joey," Hey Rach listen, did you know that during pregnancy your fingers swell up
to twice their size and never go back."
1,Rachel," (looking at her fingers) Oh my…God! Let me see that! (Grabs the
book from him.)"
2,Joey, (laughing) You fall for it every time!
3,Phoebe, (entering) Hey!
4,Rachel, Hi!
5,Phoebe, I brought you my old maternity clothes! (Sets a bag on the counter.)
6,Rachel," Oh Pheebs that’s so sweet—(Grabs a pair of pants)—Ooh,
those are so cute!"
7,Phoebe," Yeah! And look, (Grabs the pants) see how they expand as the baby grows?
(There’s a stretchy part in front.) And then after the baby’s born, they’re
great for shoplifting melons."
8,Monica," (entering) Oh good you’re all here. Thanksgiving tomorrow, four
o’clock. (To Rachel) Oh, guess who I invited. Remember that guy Will Colbert from
high school?"
9,Rachel, No.
10,Monica," He was in Ross’s class…marching band…kinda overweight?
Well, really overweight. I mean I was his thin friend."
11,Rachel," Wow! I don’t remember him. Honey, are you sure you’re not
talking about your imaginary boyfriend."
12,Monica," No that was Jarred! Wow! I haven’t thought about him in a long
time… (Stares off into the distance lost in thought.) (Pause) Anyway, umm
Will’s, Will’s here on business and he didn’t have a place to go so I
invited him here."
13,Rachel, Oh that’s nice.
14,Monica," Oh, and by the way, he’s lost a bunch of weight. I mean he looks
goo-ood! Okay, I mean really, really gorgeous! (Joey clears his throat.) I still
love Chandler."
15,Joey, I just want you to say it once in a while.
16,Monica," All right okay, just so you know, I’m not gonna make a turkey this
year."
17,Joey, What?!
18,Monica, Well Phoebe doesn’t eat turkey…
19,Joey, Phoebe!
20,Phoebe," Turkey’s are beautiful, intelligent animals!"
21,Joey, No they’re not! They’re ugly and stupid and delicious!
22,Monica," All right! Okay, it’s just Phoebe. Will’s still on a diet,
Chandler doesn’t eat Thanksgiving food, and Rachel’s having her aversion to
poultry."
23,Joey, She is?
24,Rachel," Remember I had to leave the room the other day when you had that roast
chicken?"
25,Joey," Yeah. But I thought that was because I put the whole thing on my hand and
made it walk across the table."
26,Monica," Anyway, it just doesn’t seem worth it to make a whole turkey for
just three people. Okay? It’s a lot of work."
27,Joey," But you gotta have turkey on Thanksgiving! I mean, Thanksgiving with no
turkey is like-like Fourth of July with no apple pie! Or Friday with no two pizzas!"
28,Monica," All right fine! If it means that much to you! But just—there’s
gonna be a ton left over."
29,Joey, No there won’t! I promise I will finish that turkey!
30,Monica," All right, you’re telling me you can eat an entire turkey in just
one sitting?"
31,Joey," That’s right! ‘Cause I’m a Tribbiani! (To Rachel) And this
is what we do! I mean we may not be great thinkers or world leaders, we don’t read a
lot or run very fast, but damnit! We can eat!"
34,Monica," Hey, isn’t weird to think about how next year at this time
they’ll be a little baby at the table? (Chandler turns around in horror.) (Seeing
him) Rachel’s! But good to know where you’re at!"
35,Phoebe, (entering) Hey!
36,Monica, Hey!
37,Phoebe, Happy Thanksgiving!
38,Monica, You too!
39,Phoebe, Anything I can do to help?
40,Monica," Actually there is. Chandler usually helps me with this, but he’s
really into the game so I don’t want to bother him. Could you help me fold these
napkins? (Hands her a stack of them.)"
41,Phoebe, Sure!
42,Monica, I’m gonna go across the hall to check on the yams.
43,Phoebe, Okay. (She starts folding the napkins in half.)
44,Monica," No! No! No! No sweetie! No! Not like that! We’re not at a barn
dance. You’ve gotta—you wanna fold them like swans. Like I showed you at
Christmas time, remember?"
45,Phoebe," Yeah, it all just came screaming back to me. (Monica exits.) (To
Chandler) So how’s the game?"
46,Chandler, I have no idea.
47,Phoebe, What?
48,Chandler," Yeah! I’m just pretending to watch the game so I don’t have
to help out with stuff."
49,Phoebe," I don’t believe you! That is…brilliant! And Monica has no
idea?"
50,Chandler, Nope! Every once and a while I just scream stuff at the TV. 
52,Monica, Is your team winning hon?
53,Chandler," Yeah! Anderson just scored again! (To Phoebe) There’s no
Anderson."
54,Phoebe," Well I want to get in on this. Hey Mon? I don’t think I can help
you after all, I didn’t realize this game was on."
55,Monica," Oh, I didn’t know you liked football."
56,Phoebe," Well normally I don’t, but y’know…(looks at the
TV)…Green Bay is playing."
57,Monica, You like Green Bay?
58,Phoebe," Well it’s only like my favorite bay! {Actually, it’s not bad.
It just gets a little cold in winter, but in Wisconsin winter only lasts from August to
June. J }"
60,Monica, Hey!
64,Monica," Aww thanks! God Will I’m so glad that you came! You look great! You
must’ve lost like…"
66,Monica, A pie! (Will brought a pie.)
68,Monica," You wanna meet some people? This is uh; this is my husband Chandler.
Chandler, this is Will."
70,Chandler," Oh hey. I’d shake your hand but uh; I’m really into the
game. Plus, I think it’d be better for my ego if we didn’t stand right next to
each other."
71,Monica, This is Phoebe.
72,Phoebe," (nonchalantly glancing) Hey. (Turns back around.) Wow! (Looks up.) Well
done."
73,Monica, (to Will) Wanna give me a hand?
75,Monica, Well you look incredible too! You’re just—you’re so fit!
76,Chandler," I’m watching the game, but I’m not deaf!"
77,Monica," Oh umm, I meant to tell you, Ross is coming."
79,Monica, Good. And Rachel Green too. (Will stops suddenly.)
81,Monica, Is there a problem?
83,Monica, What?
85,Chandler," (To Phoebe) Y’know, it’s been a while since we’ve
screamed something. Maybe we should."
86,Phoebe, Oh okay.
87,Chandler, Oh come on!
88,Phoebe, Noooo!! Damn you ref! You burn in hell!!!
90,Monica," Hey, what are you doing? You gotta save room, you’ve got almost an
entire turkey to eat."
91,Joey," Let me explain to you how the human body works. I have to warm my stomach
first. Eatin’ chips is like stretching."
92,Monica, All right.
93,Joey," Don’t worry, Tribbianis never get full."
95,Joey, (To Monica) Who the hell is this guy?
96,Monica, Will! From high school.
97,Joey, Oh hey!
98,Monica, (to Will) Joey.
100,Ross, (entering) Will!
102,Ross," Hey-hey you came! Man you look incredible! Hot stuff! (They hug and Ross
realizes what he said.) Hot stuff?"
104,Ross," Yeah, you too. Man, so-so what are you up to?"
106,Ross, Really? Yeah that-that sounds interesting.
108,Ross," Oh! Man I don’t think I’ve seen you since uh, Lance Davis’
graduation party."
110,Ross," Yeah. It would’ve been good if we had gotten in, but still real fun."
112,Ross, Yeah.
114,Ross, (laughs) Yeah.
116,Ross, So how long are you in town?
117,Rachel," (entering, carrying a baking dish) Hi! "
118,Monica, Hey sweetie. Oh good. (Takes the baking dish from her.)
120,Ross," Aw—oh, that’s right. Are-are you gonna be okay?"
122,Ross," Will, high school was-was a long time ago."
124,Rachel," (sees Will) Oh my God Monica, who is that?"
125,Monica, That’s Will from high school!
126,Rachel," Oh! I do not remember him! Wow! He's really got that sexy, smoldering
thing going on. (We see Will angrily staring at Rachel.) Oh my God, he’s… Look
at the way he’s just staring at me. I think he’s trying to mouth something to
me, but I can’t make it out. (Will mouths, ""I hate you."")"
127,Monica," Okay, dinner’s ready!"
128,Chandler, Good game!
129,Phoebe, Yeah.
130,Chandler, Yeah. Solid effort. Solid effort.
131,Monica," Oh, so who won?"
132,Phoebe, (simultaneously) Green Bay.
133,Chandler, (simultaneously) Detroit.
134,Monica, What?
135,Phoebe," Well the Lions technically won, but it was a moral victory for the Green
Bay…Mermen."
137,Rachel," Hi! Will, right?"
139,Rachel, Hi! I’m Rachel Green.
141,Rachel," Really?! Aren’t you sweet! I gotta tell you though, I am, I am
having the hardest time placing you. Oh-oh hang on! Did we umm, did we fool around at
Lance Davis’ graduation party?"
143,Rachel, Thank you!
144,Monica," (breaking it up) Uh Rachel? Rachel, why don’t you sit here? (Next
to Joey) And Will you sit way over there. (The other side of the table.)"
146,Joey," That’s it?! Even if nobody helps me I can eat that no problem. At
least give me a challenge!"
147,Monica," (laughs) This is Chandler’s chicken. This is the turkey. (Sets down
a huge turkey.)"
148,Joey, (quietly) Oh. How-how big is that?
149,Monica, About nineteen pounds.
150,Joey, (To Rachel) It’s like me when I was born.
151,Rachel," All right, who would uh, like some yams? Will?"
153,Rachel," What? (Joey starts offering Ross some turkey.) Oh y’know what? Can
we please keep the chicken and the turkey and everything on the other side of the table?
The smell is just yuck!"
155,Rachel, I’m sorry. What?
157,Joey," (To Monica) Seriously, who is this guy?"
158,Rachel," Umm, I’m sorry. Do you-do you have a problem with me?"
160,Phoebe, I think you do.
161,Monica," (To Rachel) Apparently you were umm, a little mean to him in high
school."
163,Rachel, I’m-I’m—I had no idea. I’m sorry. I…
165,Monica, Oh Will. But you-you’ve worked so hard…
167,Monica," Okay. (Chandler grabs the dish from Monica and hands it to Will who
starts dishing out a large helping.)"
168,Rachel," Uh Will umm, I just want to say that I’m real sorry for whatever
I-I did to you in high school…"
170,Rachel, You had a club?!
172,Rachel," Whoa! My God! So what, you all just joined together to hate me?! Who
else was in this club?"
174,Ross," No need to point, she knows who Ross is."
177,Rachel, (To Ross) So you were in an I Hate Rachel club?
179,Ross, No. No.
180,Rachel, So who else was in this club?
181,Ross," Uh actually, there-there was also that exchange student from Thailand but
I-I don’t think he-he knew what it was."
182,Rachel," So Ross, we went out for two years, and you never told me you were in an
I Hate Rachel club."
184,Ross, That was in high school! It’s not like it was binding forever.
186,Rachel," Okay Monica, did you know about this?!"
187,Monica," I swear I didn’t. (To Ross and Will) Hey! Is that why you guys used
to go up to your bedroom and lock the door?"
189,Monica," Hmm, a little relieved, I gotta say."
190,Ross," Look Rach I-I’m sorry, okay? I…I was a stupid kid, okay? The
only reason I joined…"
192,Ross," …co-founded. Co-founded the club was because I was insanely in love
with you. Obviously I didn’t handle it very well. But if you think about it the I
Hate Rachel Club was really the I Love Rachel Club."
194,Rachel," Okay. So what? You guys would just like get together and like just say
mean things about me?"
196,Ross, No-no! No-no. No-no.
197,Phoebe, What?! What else did you do?
199,Rachel, What rumor?
200,Phoebe," Oh, come on Will! Just take off your shirt and tell us!"
201,Rachel, Ross!
202,Ross," It was no big deal. We-we…said that the rumor was…that
umm…you had both…male and female reproductive parts."
203,Rachel, What?!
205,Rachel, (shocked) Oh my God!
206,Monica, You started that?!
207,Rachel, What?! You heard that?! (Goes and stands behind Joey.)
208,Monica, Everyone at our school heard it!
209,Chandler," Everybody at my school heard it! You were the hermaphrodite
cheerleader from Long Island?!"
210,Rachel," Oh no!!!! Oh my God!! This is all making so much sense to me now! This
is why Adam Carter wouldn’t go out with me! This is why Billy Tratt would just stay
in this region! (Motions to her breasts.) (Joey has turned around.)"
211,Ross," Actually, Billy Tratt is gay now. So-so that one’s not really our
fault."
212,Rachel," Monica, how come you never told me this?!"
213,Monica," I thought it might be true. And I was afraid that you were gonna cry and
then show it to me."
215,Rachel, Joey stop staring! There’s nothing there! It’s not true!
216,Joey, I’m afraid I’m gonna need proof.
217,Rachel, Oh! (Hits him and storms out.)
219,Joey, You are my Everest.
220,Monica," Joey, you don’t have to finish that."
221,Joey," Oh yes I do. Otherwise what’s next? Today I’m just a guy who
can’t finish a turkey, but tomorrow I’m the guy who eats half a Powerbar,
wraps up the rest, and puts in the fridge? No! No, I just…I just—I gotta change
my pants. (Gets up and heads for the door.) Jeans have no give. (Exits.)"
222,Rachel," (entering carrying a book) Okay! Okay! Listen to what Sean McMahon wrote
in my yearbook senior year, ""Dear Rach, you’re such a good person."" Not
girl! Person!"
223,Ross," Rach, I think you’re reading a little too much into it."
224,Rachel," (reading what he wrote again) ""Dear Rach, you’re a great
person. Sorry about your tiney-wienie."" (Will laughs.)"
225,Ross," Look, what do you want me to do? Do you want me to call everyone in the
entire school and tell them it wasn’t true?!"
226,Rachel, Yes!
228,Monica, Oh! Me too!
229,Ross," Well look-look I’m not calling anybody! Okay? It was like a million
years ago!"
230,Rachel," I don’t care how long ago it was! You told people that I was half
and half! Y’know what? I just want to point out I never did anything to hurt you in
high school."
231,Monica, That’s not totally true.
232,Rachel, What?
233,Ross, What?
234,Monica," Well you-you did start that rumor about Ross making out with Mrs.
Altman, our 50-year-old librarian."
235,Ross, (shocked) (To Rachel) How did you know that?!!!!
236,Monica, It’s true?!!
237,Ross, No.
238,Rachel, Yes it is! I saw you guys going at it behind the card catalog!
241,Chandler," I’m sorry. When you were in high school you made out with a
50-year-old woman?"
242,Ross, Hey! She didn’t look 50!
243,Chandler, Did she look 16?
244,Rachel," Ohh, there’s a picture of her in the yearbook actually."
245,Phoebe, Oh! (They all look.) Wow!
246,Ross, She didn’t photograph well!
247,Chandler," Well, she probably wasn’t familiar with the process having spent
most of her life sitting for oil paintings!"
248,Phoebe," So how did this happen? Did she, did she lure you to an early bird
dinner?"
249,Ross," I was working late in the library one afternoon. It was just the two of
us. She needed some help with her word jumble. And one thing led to another. If you must
know, Anita was very gentle and tender. May she rest in peace…"
250,Monica, Didn’t she walk with a cane?
251,Ross," Only when it was damp!! (To Rachel) I can’t believe you-you told
people about this?! Everybody knew?! Y’know what? (To Will) I’m back in the
club!"
253,Phoebe, I wanna join!
254,Rachel, Wh—Phoebe!!
255,Phoebe," I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I never got to be in a club. I-I
didn’t go to high school, but three of us would meet behind a dumpster to learn
French. Bonjour."
256,Rachel," All right, y’know—Fine! You guys have your stupid little club,
but I would just like to say is what you did to me is way worse than what I did to you!
You gave me a tiney-wienie! (Will laughs.)"
257,Monica," All right, listen you’re just being silly. Rachel, even with that
rumor you were one of the most popular girls in school and everyone wanted to be like you.
One girl wanted to be like you so much she stuffed her pants with a Tootsie Roll!"
258,Rachel, Wow…
259,Monica," And Ross, if it weren’t for Rachel’s rumor I mean no one in
high school would even know who you were. She put you on the map!"
260,Ross, As a romancer of the elderly.
261,Monica," Hey! Mrs. Altman was the kind of woman you could tell she used to be
pretty."
262,Ross, The eyes…did still sparkle.
263,Monica," Hey guys this stuff is just so way in the past. You-you’ve been
through so much since then. And right now you’ve got so much more important stuff
going on in your life. Can’t you just let this go?"
264,Rachel, She’s right.
265,Ross, Yeah. I mean we are having a baby together.
267,Ross, Yeah.
269,Ross, Nope.
271,Phoebe," Okay. (Goes over and hugs him.) It’s exactly how I’d imagined
it would be."
272,Joey," (entering, wearing the maternity pants from earlier) All right
where’s that turkey!"
273,Phoebe, Joey! Those are my maternity pants!
274,Joey, Not now! These are my Thanksgiving pants!
277,Joey," Well that’s it. I’m done. Whew! (Wipes his forehead.) There come
the meat sweats. (Chandler hands him a towel and he wipes his face.)"
278,Monica," Well Joey, we’re all…we’re all very proud of you."
279,Chandler," Yes, I believe we can expect a call from the President any moment now."
280,Phoebe, Is there anything we can do for you?
281,Joey," No just, nobody press on my stomach."
282,Rachel, You can keep those pants by the way.
284,Joey, Whoa—hey—wh-wh-what do you got there? What is that? Pie?
285,Monica," Yeah, you want some?"
286,Joey," Ah, just cut me a little sliver. (Monica prepares to cut a little sliver.)
A little bigger. (Monica prepares to cut a bigger piece.) Little bigger. (Monica moves the
knife again.) What?! Are you afraid you’re gonna run out?! Cut me a real piece!"
0,Monica, Hey! So what do you think?
1,Chandler," New haircut? (Monica nods ‘No.’) Necklace? (No) Dress? (No)
Boots? (Monica nods ‘Yes.’) Boots!"
2,Monica," Yes! Now, they’re a little more than I normally spend on
boots…or rent (Shows him the receipt.)"
3,Chandler, Oh my God!
4,Monica, I know.
5,Chandler, I’m gonna miss being able to afford food.
6,Monica," I’m sorry, they just, they just look so good! And the saleswoman
was looking at me like, ""Oh, these are way too expensive for you."""
7,Chandler, She had a point. (Shows her the receipt.) 
8,Rachel, (entering) Hi!
9,Monica, Hey.
10,Rachel, Oh my God! (Notices the boots) Oh Monica! Those boots are amazing!
11,Monica, They’re mine!
12,Chandler," Yeah well, too bad we’re gonna have to return them."
13,Rachel, Return them?! Shh! They’re gonna hear you!
14,Monica," Honey, I’m not returning them. Okay? I mean I-I know they cost a
lot, but I’m going to wear them all the time. You’ll see. Besides, I love the
compliments. I mean, have you ever had something so beautiful everyone wanted it?"
15,Chandler, I have you.
16,Monica, Nice try; I’m keeping the boots.
19,Ross," That’s right, I love you! And-and I’m gonna play with you all
the time."
20,Phoebe, How can you let him talk to your crotch like that?
21,Rachel, (pause) He’s talking to the baby.
22,Phoebe," Ohh! Okay! Okay, cause when-when he said, ""I can’t wait to
hear your first words,"" I thought, ""There’s a trick."""
23,Rachel," Okay. Well, I gotta go you guys. I’ll see you later."
24,Phoebe, Okay.
25,Ross, Bye.
26,Rachel, Bye. (She gets up to leave but is stopped by Joey)
27,Joey," Oh hey Rach, listen—Hi!"
28,Rachel, Hi.
29,Joey," Umm, can you do me a favor? I was talkin’ to my sister and she knows
you work at Ralph Lauren…"
30,Rachel," No, forget it! No way! I am not sending anymore Ralph Lauren
clothes to prison. It is a waste."
31,Joey," No-no-no-no-no-no, not her, not her. My youngest sister, Dina, she’s
really interested in fashion, and she wants to talk to someone successful, y’know, to
give her some advice."
32,Rachel, I guess I can talk to one of my supervisors…
33,Joey," Oh no-no-no-no, she wants to talk to you!"
34,Rachel, Really?! Oh my God! I’m successful!
35,Joey," Okay, so will you meet with her?"
36,Rachel, Yes! I’d love to! Have her come by the office.
37,Joey," Great! Thanks! You’re gonna love her so much. And—Oh, she’s
the smartest of all the Tribbiani children. Hey, y’know the S.A.T’s?"
38,Rachel, Yeah.
39,Joey, She took ‘em!
41,Phoebe, Hey Ross! Doesn’t Ben go to the Smithfield Day School?
42,Ross, Yeah. Why?
43,Phoebe, Sting has a son that goes there too!
44,Ross, Yeah I know; he’s in Ben’s class.
45,Phoebe," You knew this and you never said anything?! With all the stupid dinosaur
stuff you tell us?!"
46,Ross," Fine! No more dinosaur stuff! Can I talk about fossils? (Joey is about to
sit down and hears this so instead he groans and exits.)"
47,Phoebe," Sting’s son, seven years old and there’s a picture."
48,Ross, What are you reading? The Kidnappers Guide to Manhattan Private Schools?
49,Phoebe," No, it’s New York magazine. It’s an article about the
best schools in the city. So how well do you know Sting?"
50,Ross," Uh, I actually haven’t even met him."
51,Phoebe," Uh-huh, yeah that’s too bad. I really want to go to his concert
Friday night, but it’s totally sold out. I know! Why don’t you meet him and get
tickets?! If you get two I’ll take you."
52,Ross," Well actually, I’m picking Ben up tomorrow, maybe he’ll be
there."
53,Phoebe," There you go! Oh, you are so lucky! You might actually get to meet Sting
tomorrow! That’s why you have kids!"
55,Monica, Hey guys!
56,Chandler, Hey-hey.
57,Rachel, Hi Monica!
58,Monica, Hey. (Sits down on the arm of the couch.)
59,Rachel, Hi boots.
60,Monica," See Chandler? I’m getting a lot of use out of them already!
They’re very practical. See, you can wear them with dresses, with skirts, with
pants…"
61,Chandler," You can wear them with shorts on a street corner and earn the money to
pay for them. (Goes and gets some coffee at the counter.)"
62,Phoebe, Wow! They’re beautiful!
63,Rachel, Ahh…
64,Monica, (almost crying) They hurt so much!
65,Phoebe, What?!
66,Monica, The guy who made these hates feet and wants to see them die!
67,Rachel, Well-well you can give them to me! I haven’t felt my feet in years!
68,Monica," I can’t! I spent so much money on them and I told Chandler that
I’d wear them all the time, I just can’t give them away!"
69,Phoebe, Well then get your money back and return them!
70,Monica," I can’t do that either! The soles’ are already a little
scuffed up and the insides are filled with my blood."
71,Ross, (entering) Hey!
72,Chandler, (returning to his seat) Hey!
73,Ross, Hey I uh just picked up Ben from school…
74,Chandler," (spinning around looking for him) I don’t think you did a very
thorough job!"
75,Ross," I dropped him off at Carol’s. (To Phoebe) Anyway, it turns out that
I’m not going to be able to get those tickets though."
76,Phoebe, Oh no! Why not?
77,Ross, Well it turns out that Ben and Sting’s son do not get along.
78,Phoebe, How come?!
79,Ross," Apparently, Sting’s son made fun of the fact that Ben’s moms are
lesbinims."
80,Phoebe," Wait! But Ross if they don’t get along then you should
smooth things over. Make them be friends."
81,Ross," Phoebe, you can’t force kids to be friends."
82,Phoebe," Sure you can! Give them some blocks, put them in a playpen!"
83,Ross, Playpen?! Ben’s seven!
84,Phoebe," Your kid is seven?! (Ross nods, ""Yes."") (To the rest)
He’s really small. (To Ross) Please! Please get the tickets!"
85,Ross," Look I’m sorry Pheebs, I can’t do it."
86,Phoebe, Yes you can! Sting says so himself!
87,Ross, What?
88,Phoebe, (singing) Rosssss can!
89,Ross," Look Phoebe, I’m sorry it’s just…"
90,Phoebe, (singing) Rossss can!
91,Ross," Phoebe, I…"
92,Phoebe," (singing) Rosss can! Give me the tickets! Ross can give me the
tickets!!"
95,Joey," (entering, with Dina) Here she is! Future fashion superstar!"
96,Rachel," Oh Joey, I’m hardly a…"
97,Joey, My little sister Dina!
98,Rachel, Right! Hi Dina! 
100,Rachel, Nice to meet you. (They shake hands.)
102,Joey," This is so exciting for her. Well, I’ll let you two fash…ists
get down to business. (Exits.)"
103,Rachel," Okay. All right Dina, well let’s talk about the different areas of
fashion that you could get involved in. Let’s see, there’s design, but you may
need a whole other degree for that. Uh, there’s-there’s sales, which is great
because you get to travel…"
105,Rachel, (stunned) And there’s marketing…
107,Monica, (standing up) Ahhhhhhhh!
108,Chandler, (opening the door) What’s wrong?
109,Monica," Oh nothing I’m just—just was yawning. (Mimics the groan from
before and stretches.)"
110,Chandler," Oh don’t forget, my office holiday party is tonight. (They go
into the apartment.)"
111,Monica," Honey, we don’t really have to go to this thing tonight do we?"
112,Chandler," Now sweetie, I know you don’t like my office parties, but you can
wear your new boots. See? Every cloud has a…supple leather lining."
113,Monica," I-I don’t-I don’t think that I’m gonna wear the boots
tonight."
114,Chandler, Why not?
115,Monica," Well y’know, I’m just-I’m just worried that bosses will
see them and think they pay you too much money. Or! Or your assistant will see them
and-and want a raise!"
116,Chandler, Do you think I work at some kind of boot pricing company?
117,Monica," Anyway, I picked up this outfit that I want to wear and the, and the
boots don’t really go with it."
118,Chandler," You said that you paid all that money because those boots go with
skirts, dresses, and pants!"
119,Monica," Fine! If you want me to wear the boots, I’ll wear the boots. In
fact, I’ll go into my room right now and y’know try the outfit on."
120,Chandler, Okay.
121,Monica," Okay? (She starts to walk which causes her to start crying) Ooo wee!
Christmas party in my boots! (Runs into the bedroom and mixes saying ‘ow’ with
laughing.)"
124,Rachel," Honey, it’s going to be okay. He’s been incredibly supportive
of me, and if he gets a little upset; that’s what the meatball sub is for. (She gives
Dina a sandwich wrapped in aluminum foil.)"
126,Rachel, Okay.
128,Joey," Hey! It’s my fashion girls! (They don’t react.) What’s
wrong?"
129,Rachel," Honey, why don’t you sit down? Dina has something that she wants to
tell you."
130,Joey," (concerned) Oh. What’s, what’s going on? Is it mom? Is she sick?
Is it dad’s heart? Is that a sandwich?"
132,Joey, Is that a sandwich?!
133,Rachel, Joey…there’s something that you…should know. Dina?
135,Joey, (angrily) What?!
136,Rachel," (To Dina) Now! Give him the sandwich! Give him the sandwich! (She
quickly sets the sandwich in front of him.)"
137,Joey," Well obviously this is a mistake! You can’t be pregnant! Because you
have to have sex to get pregnant!"
139,Rachel, What?! Dina…
140,Joey," (to Rachel) Bub!!! (Points at her and quiets Rachel.) (To Dina) I
can’t believe this! You’re the good one! You went to college! Both years! Who
did this to you?!"
142,Joey," You got pregnant for funny?! Dina…if he’s funny…laugh!
All right, I’ll be back in a little while! You stay here!"
144,Joey, I can’t look at you right now! (Exits and slams the door behind him.)
146,Rachel, I know.
150,Phoebe," Oh, there you are Ben!"
152,Phoebe," Well, I heard you’re having a problem with one of the boys in your
class. And so I thought I would just come down here and sit you both down, have a little
talk and make it all okay. Now umm, the boy’s name is Sting’s son."
154,Phoebe," Now Ben, sometimes people may seem like jerks on the outside, but they
have famous fathers."
156,Phoebe," Him you’re friends with. (Starts looking at the children trying to
find Jack and a teacher notices her.)"
158,Phoebe," Yes! Yes you can, I’m looking for Jack’s parents."
160,Phoebe," Uh-huh, I’m with Ben."
162,Phoebe," I am one of Ben’s mothers. I’m a lesbian. It was, it was
difficult coming out to my parents."
164,Phoebe, Oh.
166,Phoebe, Ah! Okay so that would make me Susan.
168,Phoebe," Yeah! Let’s do that!! That-that sounds good. We should sit down and
talk, just me, my lover Carol, and the Stings. Umm, how-how will I get in touch with them?"
170,Phoebe," Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Umm, could-could I get a copy of that? ‘Cause Carol
threw it out, she lost ours. She’s such a scatterbrain, but man what a hot piece of
ass."
172,Chandler," Y’know, that party wasn’t bad."
173,Monica," Yeah! I didn’t know there would be dancing. That was a fun
surprise!"
174,Chandler," I don’t see any uh, cabs. Maybe we should just walk?"
175,Monica," Oh no, we can’t walk!"
176,Chandler," What honey, it’s like fifteen blocks to the subway. Let’s
go."
177,Monica," Hey! Do you think that we can get to the subway right there if we climb
down through the manhole cover?"
178,Chandler, What’s going on?
179,Monica, I can’t walk. Okay? Okay? These boots were a huge mistake!
180,Chandler, What?
181,Monica," Okay you were right! All right, I never should have bought them!
They’re killing me! One toe at a time!"
182,Chandler," So I was right. This is what it feels like to be right. (Pause)
It’s oddly unsettling."
183,Monica, How are we gonna get home? Maybe a piggy-back ride?
184,Chandler, Hop on.
185,Monica," Okay. Wait, just give me a second, I need to just get my boots off
first. (She starts taking them off.) Ah…Ooh…Oohh…Ohh…Oh
God…Ohh…Oh…Ohh…Ohhhh…"
186,Chandler," Honey, I know you’re in pain right now, but I’m a little
turned on."
189,Rachel, What college was that Dina?
193,Rachel," Joey, what are you doing?"
194,Joey," Just what needs to be done! Dearly beloved, we are gathered here to join
this man and this woman…"
195,Rachel, Oh Joey this is crazy!
196,Joey," Don’t interrupt me when I’m talkin’ to God! Now where were
we? Oh right, okay. Do you Dina, take this man…"
198,Joey, Oh you’ll take ‘em!
200,Joey, Hey! You don’t get a say in this!
202,Joey," Ahhh! I heard ""I do"", we’re halfway there! Okay! (To Bobby)
You!"
203,Rachel," All right Joey! That is enough! (Grabs him and pulls him away from Bobby
and Dina) Listen, as beautiful and moving as this ceremony is, it’s not legal. Okay?
They-they don’t have a marriage license, they don’t have any witnesses, and the
groom only has on one shoe!"
205,Joey, Well what am I supposed to do?
206,Rachel," You’re supposed to realize that they are adults! And that they can
make their own decisions."
207,Joey, No they can’t! They were stupid enough to get knocked up!
208,Rachel," Heyyyyy! Contraceptives are not always effective! (To Bobby and Dina)
Right?"
210,Rachel," Oh, come on kids! A little help here!"
212,Phoebe," Wow! This place is incredible! (Gasps) Sting’s pen…that he
gave to Phoebe. (Puts the pen in her purse and goes over to a floor-to-ceiling bookcase)
Come on! Secret passageway! (Starts pulling books at random as Trudie enters.)"
214,Phoebe, Hi!
216,Phoebe, Uh-huh.
218,Phoebe, Why else would I be here?
220,Phoebe, Uh-huh. (They go and sit down.)
222,Phoebe, Yeah.
224,Phoebe," Umm, I’m sorry. Won’t-won’t Jack’s father be joining
us?"
226,Phoebe," Uh-hmm. Okay. Well then, could we reschedule? For say, Friday night
perhaps at 8 o’clock?"
228,Phoebe," Concert. Yeah. That does put us in…quite a pickle. Because you see
I’m very busy before and after the concert, and he’s obviously busy during."
230,Phoebe," Unless! Unless umm, okay I-I would be willing to go to the concert, umm,
all the while thinking about the children of course."
232,Phoebe," Oh, thank you. Four would be great."
234,Phoebe, Oh good! Then you’re in luck! Ben’s not my son!
236,Phoebe, The Police? Here? A reunion?! (She gets out her camera.)
238,Chandler," Okay, ten blocks down. Five to go."
239,Monica, (notices something in the window) Oh wait! Stop! Stop! Stop!
240,Chandler, Oh I’m sorry! Do you need a break?
241,Monica," My boots in tan! Hey! Can you get a little closer so I can see the
price?"
242,Chandler, I can see it from right here. It’ll cost you one husband.
243,Monica," Okay, I’m sorry. I think I can walk the rest of the way now.
Just-just give me my boots."
244,Chandler, (pause) I don’t have your boots.
245,Monica, Well I don’t have them either. Where are they?
246,Chandler," Well, why don’t you check in one of my saddlebags while I chew on
a bale of hay!"
247,Monica," Okay. (She gets off him.) God well, we gotta go back and get them!"
248,Chandler," Honey, are you seriously ever gonna wear the boots again?"
249,Monica," Okay, I’m never gonna wear them again. I just didn’t get a
chance to say goodbye."
250,Chandler, Y’know what? You can say goodbye to the tan ones.
251,Monica, Okay. (Climbs back on his back.) All right.
252,Chandler, Okay. (Moves closer to the window.)
253,Monica, (to the boots) Bye boots—Wait! Half off?! (Chandler runs off.)
255,Rachel," Joey, just because they’re not getting married doesn’t mean
this is going to be a disaster. Maybe they have a plan!"
256,Joey," Oh? Oh! Okay! Okay! Let’s hear their plan! Now, what’s the
future look like for Dina and Bobby?"
258,Joey, (to Dina) You were right. He is funny.
259,Rachel," Hey, now wait a minute! I get when you told people at first that you
wanted to be an actor they laughed at you! Now come on Bobby, why don’t you tell us a
little bit about your band?"
261,Rachel, (To Dina) Really? (Nods her head at Bobby.)
262,Joey," Dina, if you’re having a baby you should be married! Even if it is to
Bobby! (Bobby gets happy.) Dude, that’s not a compliment!"
264,Joey," So whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! What are you gonna do? You’re gonna have the
baby and-and raise it by yourself…without a husband?! You can’t be a single
mother alone! You’re gonna ruin your life!"
265,Rachel, Oh excuse me! Am I ruining my life?
266,Joey," No! No! No! It’s different for you. You’re so strong and
together. You’re not some dumb kid who doesn’t know what she’s doing."
268,Joey," One pregnant woman at a time, please! I just want you to be okay."
269,Rachel, So forcing her to marry Bobby is gonna make that happen?
270,Joey," Maybe! (To Bobby) Well! Well…so-so uh, what kind of music does Numb
Nuts—Oh forget it! I can’t!"
274,Joey, Because! ‘Cause… ‘Cause you’re my baby sister!
276,Joey," Well I’d be scared of them, but all right."
278,Joey, Of course he’s gonna have his Uncle Joey!
280,Joey, That’s right! By his uncle too!
282,Rachel," Okay Bobby, why don’t we just come over here and let them have a
little moment. (Drags Bobby away from Joey and Dina.)"
283,Joey, Come here! (Hugs Dina and Bobby looks to hug Rachel.)
284,Rachel, No! Seriously! What’s wrong with you?!
287,Ross, You’re gonna love me so much. I got Sting tickets!! (Holds up two.)
288,Phoebe, Oh my God! I do love you! How did you do it?!
289,Ross, Well…let’s just say… (singing) Rosss caaaaan!
290,Phoebe," Oo, where are the seats?"
291,Ross," Uh, middle balcony."
292,Phoebe," Okay, now would you say that that’s more than 50 yards away from
Sting, his wife, or a member of his family?"
293,Ross, Yeah.
294,Phoebe, Then that’s not breaking the law! I’m there!
0,Rachel, Phoebe?
1,Phoebe, Yeah?
2,Rachel," Look at that guy by the window, wow!"
3,Phoebe," He’s awfully short and I think he’s talking to himself. And to
be completely honest, he’s not that good in bed."
4,Rachel," Oh, what is wrong with me lately? I mean it’s like every guy I
see—I mean look here. (Points behind them) Look at that guy for example, I mean
normally that’s not someone I would-would be attracted to, but right now, with the
way I’m feeling, all I want to do is rip off his sweatpants and fanny pack."
5,Phoebe," Wait a second! This is about the fourth month of your pregnancy, right?"
6,Rachel, Yeah.
7,Phoebe," This is completely normal, around the fourth month your hormones start
going crazy."
8,Rachel, Really?! So this has happened to you?
9,Phoebe," Oh absolutely yeah! Oh and keep in mind, now, I was carrying triplets so
in, y’know, medical terms I was-I was thrice as randy."
10,Rachel," Wow! This explains so much! Last weekend, I went from store to store
sitting on Santa’s lap."
11,Phoebe," Yeah. Yeah, I remember trying to steal a cardboard cutout of Evander
Holyfield from a Foot Locker."
12,Rachel, Ah.
13,Phoebe, Yeah.
14,Rachel," Well, y’know what? I go see my doctor tomorrow, I’ll ask her
about this. Maybe she can give me a pill or something."
15,Phoebe," Yeah. Yeah, that’s what you need a good…pill."
19,Ross, Hi!
21,Ross," Oh great! Hey-hey Joey, do you want to check out pictures of me and Mona
ice skating?"
22,Joey," Oh uh, ordinarily I would love too, but I am just swamped right now.
(Brushes something off of his shirt and looks around, but doesn’t move from his
chair.)"
23,Ross," Hey where-where are the pictures that creepy pretzel vendor took of us
together?"
25,Joey," I’m missin’ picture time?! (Jumps over to look, Ross glares at
him and he retreats.)"
26,Phoebe, (sitting down next to Ross) Y’know she has a face Ross!
28,Ross," Wow! That is a good one! Wow, it looks like a, like a holiday card
y’know, with the tree in the middle and the skaters and the snow."
30,Ross, (pause) Together? Like-like to people?
32,Ross, Okay. (Not happy about it.)
34,Ross," Uh sure, sure."
36,Phoebe, Bye.
38,Joey, (To Ross) Congratulations! You just got married!
39,Ross, I know. Can you believe that?
40,Phoebe," Wait, I’m-I’m sorry. What’s the big deal about a holiday
card?"
41,Ross," Married couples send out cards, families send out cards, people who have
been dating for a couple of months do not send out cards! What-what is she crazy?!"
42,Joey," Hey-hey-hey, hey that’s your wife you’re talking about!"
45,Chandler," Honey, you remember my boss Doug right?"
46,Monica," Yes, hi."
48,Chandler," I didn’t know you and Carol were getting divorced, I’m
sorry."
50,Monica, No leg-chewing for us sir.
52,Monica," I can’t think of anything we’re doing. (Quietly) Why
can’t I think of anything we’re doing?"
54,Monica," Okay, I’ll see you tomorrow! (Doug exits.) Just so you know,
we’re not seeing him tomorrow. (Chandler wonders why.) I-I cannot spend another
evening with that man. Do you remember how he behaved at our wedding?"
55,Chandler, No.
56,Monica," That’s because he wasn’t invited because of the way he behaved
at our engagement party."
57,Chandler," Oh yeah. Boy, urine cuts right through an ice sculpture
doesn’t it?"
60,Ross, Hey!
62,Ross," Huh. Wow, this is great."
64,Ross," Well, we-we haven’t said that to each other yet, but I guess its okay
to say it to other people."
66,Ross," A hundred?! Well, I-I guess I’ll take a—Mona, uh…I-I’m
not sure about the whole uh, card thing."
68,Ross," Sending out a holiday card, together, I mean I just don’t know if
we’re really quite there yet."
70,Ross, Yeah.
72,Ross, Huh.
74,Ross, Hmm…
77,Ross, Let’s do the card!
79,Ross, The card! I think we’re there!
81,Ross," Really?! I mean, even with the card?"
84,Rachel, Hi!
86,Rachel," Oh, okay. Hey, can I ask you a question? Was it me, or-or was the guy
who took my blood sample really cute? Y’know who I’m talking about, bald
haircut, hairy fingers… (Stops when she realizes it was her.)"
88,Rachel," Yes, you are."
90,Rachel," Oh, really, really good. But enough about me, come on! Where-where are
you from? What do you do?"
92,Rachel," Right! Right! I-I actually meant in your spare time, do you cook? Do you
ski? Or do you just hang out with your wife or girlfriend?"
94,Rachel," Oh, I love to ski! How amazing is this?!"
96,Rachel, No. I’m very comfortable.
98,Rachel," No! Shoot, Dr. Schiff what kind of question is that?!"
100,Rachel, Well would you like me to lie down on the table?
102,Rachel, Do you feel it too?
104,Rachel, Hi.
105,Phoebe," Oh hey! So, how did your doctor’s appointment go?"
106,Rachel," Well, let’s see. Uh, they gave me cute doctor today and in the
middle of the exam I put my pinky in his chin dimple."
107,Phoebe, Oh my God.
108,Monica, Why did you do that?
109,Phoebe," Okay, remember that little problem I was having during my
fourth month of
pregnancy?"
110,Monica," Oh yeah, the Evander Holyfield phase. Oh man you were so hard up you
practically came on to me."
111,Phoebe, You wish.
112,Monica," Hey, I could’ve had you if I wanted you."
113,Phoebe, Oh yeah? Come and get it.
114,Rachel," Okay, even this is turning me on!"
115,Ross, (entering) Hey!
116,Rachel," Oh hey! Hey Ross! Hey how’s it, how’s it going with you and
Mona? Are you guys still together?"
117,Ross," Oh yeah, yeah we’re moving forward. You’ll be getting our card!"
118,Monica, You and Mona are doing a holiday card together?
119,Ross," Yeah, we’re not just doing a card! Y’know, she-she also wants to
have the conversation about where the relationship is going."
120,Phoebe, Ugh! Women!
121,Ross," I know! I know! Why do you guys need to have this conversation?! Huh? I
mean no self-respecting man would ask a woman, ""So, where is this going?"""
122,Rachel, Uh Ross? You asked me that.
123,Ross," Hey! You were a closed book! Okay? I’m not a mind reader! Besides, I
hate those conversations. I’m horrible at them. Really! Maybe-maybe I need kind of a
gesture. Y’know, something that says we’re moving forward without having to talk
about it."
124,Monica, Like asking her to move in with you?
125,Ross, Smaller than that.
126,Monica, Making her a mixed tape?
127,Ross," Uh, bigger than that."
128,Phoebe, Give her a key to your apartment.
129,Ross, Whoa-hello! We were closer with the mixed tape.
130,Monica," All right. Have you said, ""I love you?"" You could say, I love
you."
131,Ross," Yeah I-I don’t-I don’t think I’m quite there yet, but I
could say I looove spending time with you."
132,Phoebe," No, we hate that."
133,Monica, That is a slap in the face.
134,Ross," Forget it. I-I—Y’know what? I’ll just have the
conversation. I’ll just say I like things the way they are, and hope for the best.
What do you think Rach?"
135,Rachel," I think, if it was a little colder in here I could see your nipples
through that sweater."
138,Chandler," Oh uh, as it turns out, we can’t do it. Monica has to work."
140,Chandler, Oh uh well tomorrow’s no good for her either.
142,Chandler, It’s the semi-finals…of her…botchy ball tournament.
144,Chandler, Well now-now you’re just talking crazy.
146,Chandler," Because uh…we-we…we split up. Monica and I split up. Hold
me."
148,Chandler," Y’know what would really help me through this tough time is
choking something. Can I choke ya?"
150,Chandler," Oh no-no-no, Monica would freak. (Doug looks at him.) But to hell with
that bitch."
152,Ross," Here we go. Mona umm, I think it’s time we-we had a conversation
about-about where things are with us."
154,Ross," Aw, we-we are so…(Motions that they’re connected.) So umm, well
I-I-I like you and I-I love umm, y’know hanging out with you. And I mean-I’m
having a lot of fun. (He pauses and thinks there might be more, but decides there
isn’t.)"
156,Ross," I mean, there’s no point in spending time with someone if-if
it’s just fun. It’s gotta be, it’s gotta be going somewhere right? So
where-where is it going? (Pause) Ah! That’s-that’s the real question. And-and
the answer is…is it’s going somewhere…fun. Now I-I know what you’re
thinking, fun was fine for you like ten years ago y’know, but you’re-you’re
not getting any younger. No I mean—No not you, not you, you—you are
getting younger. I mean—you-you look like you’re getting younger by the
second—What’s your secret?"
158,Ross," Well, well to sum up, we’re having fun, you look young."
160,Ross," But that’s not enough. So… So…here’s a key to my
apartment. (Hands her his key.)"
162,Ross, Really.
167,Rachel, You gave her a key to your apartment?!
168,Ross," Not just a key, I gave her the only key! I am now a homeless person in a
very serious relationship."
169,Phoebe, (entering with some guy) Hey. Ooh Ross! How’d the conversation go?
170,Ross," Oh great, I live on the street."
171,Phoebe, Where?! (Ross exits.)
172,Rachel, Hey!
173,Phoebe," Hi! Okay, Monica, Rachel, this is my friend Roger."
175,Monica, Hi Roger.
176,Phoebe," So umm, I’m gonna get us some drinks. (To Rachel) Would you help me
out?"
177,Rachel, Yeah. (They go into the kitchen.)
178,Phoebe," Umm, he’s here to have sex with you."
179,Rachel, What?
180,Phoebe, You’re welcome.
181,Rachel, Phoebe no!
182,Phoebe," It’s okay, he’s a virgin."
183,Monica," Rachel umm, I was just talking to this guy and I think he’ll have
sex with you."
184,Phoebe," Yeah, okay let’s leave these two alone."
185,Rachel," No! I do not care what my hormones are doing, I am not going to just do
it with some random guy!"
186,Phoebe," Fine! Then you tell Roger because he was really looking forward to this!
(Phoebe exits.)"
189,Chandler," Oh that’s all right sir, and that’s just one girl."
191,Chandler," It’s a hand. It’s a thing you use as a Jack and Coke
holder."
193,Chandler, Oh no-no-no!
196,Ross," Okay, and oh I’m gonna need a bunch of extra keys. Apparently I give
them away for no reason at all."
198,Ross, No. That guy is.
202,Ross, I’m trying to tell you I made you a mix tape.
204,Ross, I love you!
207,Chandler, Hi honey I’m home.
208,Monica, From the tequila factory?
209,Chandler," It was awful. To get out of going to dinner with Doug I told him that
you and I split up. So then he took me to all these strip clubs and sleazy bars, and then
when I wouldn’t give him my wedding ring, he threw a soda can at a bird!"
210,Monica, Come here. I can breath through my mouth.
211,Chandler," Y’know what the worse part was? I got to see what my life would
be like without you. It was like It’s a Wonderful Life with lap dances. Please
promise that you will never leave me, that we will grow old together, and be with each
other for the rest of our lives."
212,Monica," I promise. Hey, speaking of together, how about we send out a holiday
card this year?"
213,Chandler," Ooh, I don’t know if we’re there yet."
215,Rachel," Yes. Hi, I’d like to order a pizza. Okay, can I ask you a question?
Is-is the cute blond guy delivering tonight? Very Ambercrombie & Fitch. (Joey
enters.) I’ll call you back."
216,Joey, Who was that?
217,Rachel, It’s just the pizza place.
218,Joey, You hung up on the pizza place? I don’t hang up on your friends.
219,Rachel," I’m sorry honey, I’m just having a, having a rough day."
220,Joey," Oh, what’s wrong?"
221,Rachel," Oh you really, you really just don’t want to hear about it."
222,Joey, Then why did I ask?
223,Rachel," Okay, it’s just—and this is really embarrassing—but
lately with this whole pregnancy thing I’m just finding myself…how do I put this
umm, erotically charged."
224,Joey, Is that college talk for horny?
225,Rachel," Yeah. So y’know, I have all of these feelings and I don’t know
what to do about them, because I can’t date like a normal person, which is fine
because I don’t need a relationship, I mean all I really want is one great night.
Just sex, y’know? No strings attached, no relationship, just with someone that I feel
comfortable with and who knows what he’s doing. For just one great night, I mean is
that really so…hard…to find. (Looks at Joey.) So how was your day?"
226,Joey," Good, I uh, I saw a pretty big pigeon."
227,Rachel," Well, I gotta get up early and it’s almost seven o’clock."
228,Joey," Yeah, I gotta, I gotta go to my room too."
229,Rachel," Okay, good night!"
230,Joey, Good night. (They both enter their rooms.)
232,Joey, (entering) I can’t do it!
233,Rachel, (entering) I didn’t ask you to do it!
234,Joey, You’re Rachel!
235,Rachel, You’re Joey!
236,Joey, You’re my friend!
237,Rachel, Right back at ya!
238,Joey," But plus, it would be wrong and weird and-and-and bad."
239,Rachel," And so bad. I don’t even know what you’re talking about
because I didn’t ask you to do anything!"
240,Joey, I know!
242,Joey, Do you wanna do it?
243,Rachel, No!
244,Joey," All right, me neither! I was just testing you!"
245,Rachel, That’s the end of this conversation!
246,Joey, This conversation never happened!
247,Rachel, Never happened! Good night!
248,Joey, Good night!
250,Joey, Get back in there! (Rachel re-enters her room and closes the door.)
253,Phoebe," Hi. Listen, I’m sorry about that whole thing with Roger. It really
wasn’t right, and I, and I want to make it up to you, so umm, I brought you something
that I think you’ll really enjoy. (Goes into the hallway and returns carrying the
Evander Holyfield cutout.) Now, this is just a loan. Okay? I’m gonna, I’m gonna
want him back. So… (Looks at him longingly) I’m gonna go now. (Exits.) (Pause)
(Entering) I’m sorry, I thought I could do it and I can’t! (She grabs the cutout
and exits for good.)"
0,Phoebe, Hey! I got you a present!!
1,Chandler, Oh my goodness! Where did you hide it?
2,Phoebe," I got it for your wedding and I ordered it weeks ago, and it finally got
here!"
3,Chandler," Pheebs you didn’t have to get us anything for our wedding you
already sang…"
4,Monica," (interrupting) I love it! It’s huge!! Let’s open it! Open it!!
(Monica rips open the paper.)"
5,Phoebe, It’s a Ms. Pac-Man machine!!
6,Monica, Oh my God!
7,Phoebe, I didn’t know where to put it so I just left it here for now.
8,Monica," Oh well, maybe we can put it in the guest bedroom."
9,Chandler," Oh, okay. "
10,Monica, All right. (He goes to push it and it doesn’t move.)
11,Chandler, I kinda like it here.
12,Phoebe, Do you really like it?
13,Monica," Are you kidding?! I practically spent my entire childhood at the arcade!
This is like—Oh my, this is like my second favorite game!"
14,Phoebe, Oh really? What was your first?
15,Monica, Well I-I really don’t remember the name of it.
16,Chandler, Well what did it do?
17,Monica," Well, you just—you put a quarter in and y’know pull-pull some
handles and win like a candy bar or something."
18,Chandler, A vending machine?
19,Monica, Don’t feel bad for me! I won like every time!
22,Ross," Hey! Oh, I’m so glad you guys are here. I’ve been dying to tell
someone what happened in the Paleontology department today."
23,Joey, (To Rachel) Do you think he saw us or can we still sneak out?
24,Ross," Professor Neuman, the head of the department, so…."
25,Rachel, They made you head of the department!
26,Ross," No, I get to teach one of his advanced classes! (Pause) Why didn’t I
get head of the department? (Goes and gets some coffee.)"
27,Joey," Oh! Hey Rach, listen umm…"
28,Rachel, Yeah.
29,Joey," I got a big date coming up, do you know a good restaurant?"
30,Rachel," Uh, Paul’s Café. They got great food and it’s really
romantic."
31,Joey," Ooh, great! Thanks!"
32,Rachel," Yeah! Oh, and then afterwards you can take her to the Four Seasons
for drinks. Or you go downtown and listen to some jazz. Or dancing—Oh! Take her
dancing!"
33,Joey," You sure are naming a lot of ways to postpone sex, I’ll tell ya…"
34,Rachel," Ooh, I miss dating. Gettin’ all dressed up and going to a fancy
restaurant. I’m not gonna be able to do that for so long, and it’s so much fun!
I mean not that sitting at home worrying about giving birth to a sixteen pound baby is not
fun."
35,Joey," Hey, y’know what?"
36,Rachel, Huh?
37,Joey, Why don’t I take you out?
38,Rachel," What?! Joey, you don’t want to go on a date with a pregnant lady."
39,Joey," Yes I do! And we’re gonna go out, we’re gonna have a good time,
and take your mind off of childbirth and c-sections and-and giant baby heads stretching
out…"
40,Rachel," (interrupting) Okay! I’ll go with ya! I’ll go! I’ll go
with ya."
41,Joey, I’ll be fun.
42,Rachel, All right?
44,Phoebe," No. No! Yes! Ahh. Oh, would you look at that Monica? I just knocked off
all of your top scores, how sad."
45,Monica," Okay, I’m next. (Phoebe starts another game.) Don’t!
Don’t start another game! I said I’m next! Phoebe!"
46,Phoebe," Oh, I’m sorry. I didn’t hear you over all the winning."
47,Monica, Chandler! Phoebe’s hogging the game!
48,Chandler, Who cares? It’s a stupid game.
49,Monica, You only think it’s stupid because you suck at it.
50,Chandler, I don’t suck. It’s sucks. You suck.
51,Phoebe," Wait okay, if this game is gonna cause problems between the two of you,
then maybe I should just keep it."
52,Monica," No! No-no! I love it! It is a great present! In fact, why don’t you
go home and wait for the thank you card?"
53,Chandler, Why do you want to play this game so bad?
54,Phoebe," Yeah! It’s not like it spits out a Clark bar after every
game."
55,Monica," Okay. Phoebe that’s it. Come on, get out—out of the chair. Get
out! (She goes to move Phoebe, but Phoebe goes limp and Monica can’t move her.) Oh
come…Phoebe!"
57,Rachel," Joey? Could you get that? (There is no answer and she goes and opens the
door to Joey.) What are you doing here? I thought you were in your room?"
58,Joey," No, I’m picking you up for our date. These are for you. (Hands her
some flowers.)"
59,Rachel," Ohh, Lilies. Joey, they’re my favorite. Thank you."
60,Joey," And, a brownie! (Hands her a bag with the brownie in it.) Well, half a
brownie. Actually, it’s just bag. It’s been a long walk from the flower shop and
I was startin’ to feel faint so…"
61,Rachel," Oh man! This is so great! I actually feel like I’m going on a real
date! Although, I have a hint of morning sickness, and I’m wearing underwear that
goes up to about…(She snaps the waistband on her underwear that is just slightly
below her breasts)…there."
62,Joey," Hey come on now, this is a real date. Uh, so…nice place you got here.
Foosball, huh? Pizza box. Oh, a subscription to Playboy, my kind of woman."
63,Rachel," Yeah, actually that’s my roommate’s."
64,Joey, I would like to meet him. He sounds like a stand up guy.
65,Rachel," Ah yes, but he’s very protective of me so you’d better watch
yourself."
66,Joey," Ah… Hey, so this roommate of yours…is he good looking?"
67,Rachel, Hm-mmm.
68,Joey," Oh yeah, it must be tough to keep your hands of him, huh?"
69,Rachel," (laughs) Yeah, but I’m pretty sure he’s gay."
70,Joey," No-no-no-no, he’s not! No! Why are you trying to ruin the game? Come
on!"
72,Ross," …which brings us back, of course, to Greely’s theory of dominance.
(The bell rings.) Okay, that-that’s all for today. Oh, uh does anyone know where the
Freeman building is?"
74,Ross," What?! That-that’s all the way cross town, I’m supposed to teach
a graduate seminar there in ten minutes."
77,Ross, Move it! Move it! Move it!! Hey!!! I’m the teacher!!
79,Ross," Hello. (He throws his jacket towards the coat rack and misses.) I’m
sorry I’m a little late. Ah—(Checks his watch)—Whoa! A lot late. Let me
start by uh, by introducing myself, I am Professor Geller. (The bell rings.) So to sum up,
I’m Professor Geller. Good job today."
81,Rachel," Now the filet mignon, what comes with that?"
83,Rachel," Emmm. Now, instead of the vegetables, is there anyway I can substitute
the three-pound lobster?"
84,Joey," Y’know what? Bring her both, and I’ll have the same. (The
waitress leaves.)"
85,Rachel," Wow! This is shaping up to be a pretty good date—Oh, I almost
forgot. I didn’t pay you the rent check."
86,Joey," Oh whoa-whoa-whoa, no roommate stuff. Okay? We’re on a date."
87,Rachel," Okay. Wow! So I get to see what Joey Tribbiani is like on a date. So do
you have any moves?"
88,Joey," No! No. Umm, just myself and if they don’t like me for—(Laughs.)
I’m sorry I couldn’t even get through that."
89,Rachel, I knew it! I knew it. Come on tell me your moves.
90,Joey," Oh alright. Umm, well, okay, I usually start by having a bottle of wine
sent to my table from a fan."
91,Rachel, Oh my God. And that works?!
92,Joey," Well it does when you combine it with, ""This is so embarrassing, I
just want to have a normal life!"""
93,Rachel," Oh, you poor little famous man."
94,Joey," Oh okay, how about this one. I was gonna wait until the end of the night
to kiss you, but you’re so beautiful…I don’t think I can."
95,Rachel," (looks interested) Oh my God! Wow! That was fantastic, I almost leaned
in. I really almost did!"
96,Joey," Alright, so…so tell me one of your moves."
97,Rachel, Alright. So where’d you grow up?
98,Joey," That’s your move? Boy Rach, you’re lucky you’re hot."
99,Rachel," Come on, just answer the question!"
100,Joey, (exasperated) Queens.
101,Rachel, And so were-were you close to your parents?
102,Joey," Yeah, with my mom. Yeah, not so much with my dad."
103,Rachel, Why not?
104,Joey," I don’t know. I guess there’s just always been this distance
y’know—I mean we both try to pretend it’s not there, but it is."
105,Rachel," (sympathetic) Oh. (Starts rubbing his wrist with her fingers.) It’s
gotta be rough."
106,Joey," Yeah, it is. It’s really tough. Y’know sometimes I
think—Wow!! Nice move!"
107,Rachel, Huh?
108,Joey," ""Where’d you grow up,"" it’s so simple!"
109,Rachel," Thank you! And now if you’ll excuse me, I have to go to the rest
room."
110,Joey, Yeah.
112,Rachel, And now you’re watching me walk away.
113,Joey, Yes I am! Again so simple!
115,Monica, Hey.
116,Chandler, You are not going to believe what I did today!
117,Monica, Well it clearly wasn’t showering or shaving.
118,Chandler," I got good. I played this game all day and now I rule at it! They
should change the name of it to Ms. Chandler. (Pause) Although I-I hope they don’t."
119,Monica," Wait a minute, you stayed home all day and played Ms. Pac-Man
while I went off to work like some kind of chump?!"
120,Chandler," Uh-huh, and I got all the top ten scores, I erased Phoebe off the
board! High five! (Holds up his hand to give Monica a high five, only he can’t
straighten his fingers.)"
121,Monica, What is the matter with your hand?
122,Chandler," Well I’ve been playing it for like eight hours, it’ll loosen
up. Come on, check out the scores. Oh, and also look at the initials, they’re dirty
words."
123,Monica," Chandler, why would you do that?"
124,Chandler, Because it’s awesome.
125,Monica, You think this is clever?
126,Chandler," Well y’know, they only give you three letters, so after A-S-S it
is a bit of a challenge."
127,Monica," Hey wait a minute, this one isn’t dirty."
128,Chandler, It is when you put it together with that one.
129,Monica," Ah, well if you don’t clear this off, you won’t be getting one
of those from me. But Ben’s coming over here tomorrow to play this game, this
can’t be there."
130,Chandler," Come on, he won’t even know what they mean."
131,Monica, Chandler! He’s seven; he’s not stupid.
132,Chandler, Have you talked to him lately?
133,Monica," All right, look I’m just gonna unplug it."
134,Chandler," No-no-no, if you unplug it, I’ll have nothing to show for my day!
It would be like I was at work. (She unplugs it.) No! (And plugs it back in.) Hey look at
that! Look at that, it’s still there! This thing must have some kind of primitive ROM
(Read Only Memory, it’s a memory chip.) Chip in it or something!"
135,Monica, Honey you-you got to beat your scores!
136,Chandler, With the claw?!
137,Monica," All right fine. Fine, I’ll do it. I’ve just got to get this
off the screen. Carol and Susan are still upset that you taught him pull my finger."
138,Chandler," (smiles) Pull my finger—(Looks at his hand)—My hand is
messed up."
140,Rachel, I am not gonna answer that!
141,Joey," Oh come on! Just pick one! Between Monica, Phoebe, Chandler, and Ross if
you had to, if you had to, who would you punch?"
142,Rachel," No one! They are my friends, I wouldn’t punch any of them."
143,Joey, Chandler?
144,Rachel," Yeah, but I don’t know why. Look at me, I’m having such a
wonderful time!"
145,Joey," Me too! Hey Rach, can I just say I think this is the best date I ever had!"
146,Rachel, I know!
147,Joey, I never laughed so hard—Did you see the wine come out of my nose?
148,Rachel," Joey, I think everyone saw the wine come out of your nose."
149,Joey," I gotta say, I never knew I could enjoy the non-sex part of the date so
much."
150,Rachel, Well that is because you have never been on a date with me before.
151,Joey, Huh. Huh.
152,Rachel," All right, now don’t judge me. I normally wait until my date
leaves, but you live here. I’m ripping into this swan."
153,Joey," Ah! Okay, well then you don’t judge me. I’m gonna suck on the
cellophane from the brownie I had before. (They both do as they planned.)"
154,Rachel," So tell me, what are Joey Tribbiani’s end of the night moves?"
155,Joey," Ah, well, if I want the girl to kiss me, first thing I do is make my lips
look irresistible. "
156,Rachel, How do you do that?
157,Joey," Now you can’t tell anyone, but uh…I put on shiny lip balm."
158,Rachel, Oh my God!
159,Joey," Yeah, like a moth to a flame, I’m telling ya. Okay all right, so now
you go."
160,Rachel," No, I don’t want to tell you."
161,Joey, Why not?
162,Rachel, Because it’s embarrassing.
163,Joey," More embarrassing than shiny raspberry lip balm?! (Rachel just looks at
him.) I didn’t say raspberry before did I? All right just-just tell me Rach, just
tell me!"
164,Rachel," (laughs) Okay. All right, stand up. (They do so.) Well, when we’re
at the door, I lightly press my lips against his, and then move into his body just for a
second, and then I make this sound, ""Hmmm."" Okay, I know it doesn’t sound
like anything, but I swear it works."
165,Joey," (stunned and turned on) Yeah. Why—Yeah, that would work for ya…"
166,Rachel," All right, I gotta go to bed. Honey, I had such a wonderful time."
167,Joey," Oh. (She kisses him.) Yeah. (She goes into her room.) Me to. (He then
starts to freak out.)"
170,Rachel," …you were 50 minutes late to the class, what did you crawl there?!"
171,Ross," No, I ran. It was really far, and when did people stop understanding the
phrase, ""Get the hell out of my way!"""
172,Rachel," Well, why didn’t you just take a cab?"
173,Ross," Ugh, between the traffic that time of day and all the one-way streets
it’ll take me twice as long. Besides, I teach the class three times a week, who am I?
Rockefeller?"
174,Rachel, Well you’re not gonna be able to keep doing this.
175,Ross," Well I have to. Okay? If I don’t, they’ll take the class away
from me. And…I already put it in my family newsletter."
176,Rachel, You what?
177,Ross," You’ve seen it, the Geller Yeller."
178,Rachel, Right. Wow!
179,Ross," Besides, I-I think I figured out a much faster route, I’m sure I can
make it this time. I just…I just can’t be afraid to get a little bit…hit by
cars. (He goes to the bathroom as Joey enters.)"
180,Joey, Hey!
181,Rachel," Hi! Hey, remember how last night we were talking about that movie Cujo?
"
182,Joey," Oh yeah, I still can’t believe you haven’t seen Cujo.
What is wrong with you?"
183,Rachel, Relax! It’s not like it’s Citizen Kane!
184,Joey, Have you ever tried to sit through Citizen Kane?
185,Rachel," Yeah I know it’s really boring, but it’s like a big deal.
Anyway, I was thinking about renting Cujo sometime."
186,Joey," Oh yeah? All right, let’s do it tonight."
187,Rachel, Well don’t you have that big date tonight?
188,Joey, Oh right!
189,Rachel," Hey Joey, can I ask you something?"
190,Joey, Yeah.
191,Rachel," After our date last night, did you feel a little weird?"
192,Joey," Oh my God! You did too? It totally freaked me out, what was that?!"
193,Rachel," I don’t know! (Pause) I’m-I’m kinda thinking it-it was
the lobster…"
194,Joey," Oh yeah-yeah, the lobster."
195,Rachel," Yeah, I mean I was up sick all night."
196,Joey," Yeah me too, all night."
197,Rachel, Really?! How come we didn’t cross paths?
198,Joey," Yeah well that’s because uh…I stayed in my room. Yeah, you
don’t want to look in my hamper."
200,Monica," Okay, I got that. I’ll escape over there. I’ll come back over
here. All right, come on Ms. Pac-Man. It’s got—Right—(She dies.)
Well, you’re just a little bitch, aren’t you?"
201,Phoebe," (entering) Hey, you guys. Listen, I’m sorry that I was hogging the
game before—(Sees the top ten list)—Oh my God! Your friends have some
unfortunate initials!"
202,Monica, They’re all Chandler.
203,Phoebe, Chandler sucks! He couldn’t have gotten this good!
204,Chandler, I did. (Looks at his still deformed hand) But it came at a price.
205,Monica, But Ben is coming over tonight and he can’t see this.
206,Chandler," Oh come on, by age seven kids have already seen orgies. (They both
look at him.) Was it just me?!"
208,Ross," Yeah!!!! Yes, I made it! I’m on time! (Grabs a bottle of water from a
student, takes a drink, and splashes some on his face like the marathon runners do.) Okay,
why don’t we all uh, (Exhales loudly) open our books to page 23. Where… (Exhales
again) Where you will see…a uh…a bunch of uh…red spots. Okay, (Closes his
book.) umm, why don’t, why don’t you all start to read, while I—(Passes out
and collapses.)"
211,Joey," No-no! I’m fine. It’s just… Hey, can I ask you something?
Have you ever looked at someone that you’ve known for a while and then
suddenly…suddenly see them a different way?"
213,Joey," Yeah. Yeah, that…that’s exactly it. You’re right. Yeah."
215,Joey," (deadpan) Ooh! Yeah. So yeah, so you know exactly what I’m talking
about."
217,Joey," Oh yeah, sure. (She gets up, walks towards the bathroom, and Joey watches
her go.) Ehhh."
219,Monica," Oh my God Phoebe, you’re on fire!"
220,Phoebe, I know!
221,Chandler, One more score to go! You can do it! (Touches her shoulder.)
222,Phoebe, Don’t touch me!!
223,Monica, Don’t touch her!!
224,Chandler, All right! Go left! Go left! Go right!! Go right!!
225,Phoebe," I can’t!! I can’t!! (She dies.) Noooooooo!!!!!!! You son of a
bitch!!!!! "
227,Ross, Phoebe!!
228,Phoebe, Oh hi Ben—No!! Don’t look at the machine! (Covers the screen.)
230,Rachel, Oh God! Thank God you’re home! I’m watching Cujo.
231,Joey, (incredulous) Alone?!
232,Rachel, Yes! But what is wrong with this dog?!
233,Joey," Hey, did you get to the part where they’re trapped in the car and
Cujo’s throwin’ himself at the windshield?"
234,Rachel," No! No! Seriously, what’s wrong with the dog?! Wait a minute, what
are you doing home so early? What happened to your date?"
235,Joey," Oh uh, it didn’t work out."
236,Rachel, Oh. Do you want to watch the rest of the movie with me?
237,Joey," Oh uh, okay. Yeah."
238,Rachel," Y’know, I never thought I’d say this about a movie, but I
really hope this dog dies. (Joey brings over a stool at sits on it next to Rachel
who’s in the big chair.) What are you doing over there? Come sit here, you protect
me."
239,Joey," Oh sure, yeah, why not? (Sits on the arm of the chair.)"
240,Rachel," Okay. (Pushes play.) Okay, that’s him! That’s him! That’s
Cujo! That’s Cujo!"
241,Joey," All right, I know! I know. Yeah, it’ll be okay."
242,Rachel," Oh my God….What’s he gonna do now? I can’t watch! (Drags
Joey closer to her and cowers into his chest.) Oh. Seriously, how can you watch this?
Aren’t you scared?"
243,Joey, Terrified. (But for a totally different reason.)
246,Ross," So is everybody here? I got here a little early myself. Let us begin. Now,
the hydrosaurids have been unearthed in two main locations. (He moves to the map and we
see why he made it to class on time, he’s wearing in-line skates and hasn’t
taken them off.) Here. (Points to the map, somewhere in the Middle East, then spins on the
skates and points to the map.) Here. (China.) Now as for the hydrosaurs… "

what’s up?"

3,Phoebe," Okay. (Monica closes the door, gets the guitar, and then hands it out.)"
4,Monica, Okay.
5,Phoebe, Oh.
6,Monica, Here you go.
7,Phoebe, Okay. 
8,Monica, Okay.
9,Phoebe, Great! Umm…(Monica closes the door again and Phoebe knocks again.)
10,Monica, What?!
11,Phoebe, So do you want to hang out or something?
12,Monica, Phoebe! You kinda caught me at a bad time.
13,Phoebe, Oh are you and Chandler…
14,Monica, Yes! Exactly.
15,Phoebe, Okay. Do you guys want me to play for you?
16,Monica, (laughs) No. (Closes the door as Chandler walks up.)
17,Chandler," Hey Pheebs, what’s up?"
18,Phoebe, You ask an intriguing question Chandler Bing.
20,Phoebe, Oh my God! You’re getting a massage! You never let me massage you!!
21,Monica," Phoebe, I can explain!"
22,Phoebe, You told me you hate massages!
23,Chandler," Buy stamps, pick up dry cleaning…Don’t let Phoebe in."
24,Phoebe, I can’t believe this! How long as this been going on?
25,Monica," Well umm, Alexandra has been…"
26,Phoebe," Oh, it has a name?"
27,Monica," Phoebe, don’t get upset!"
28,Phoebe," Okay—Oop! Too late! I’m leaving! Come on Chandler let’s
go! (She storms out.)"
29,Chandler," Well, Phoebe I thought I’d—(Off Phoebe’s
look)—Yeah, what the hell. (Exits with Phoebe.)"
32,Joey," Oh okay, okay! One more push! One more push! Come on honey, we’re
almost there! We’re almost there!"
33,Rachel," Oh Joey, I’m so happy things worked out for us that we’re
having this baby together. I love you so much."
34,Joey," Oh, I love you too."
35,Rachel," And I hope it’s not an inappropriate time to say this but,
you’re the best sex I ever had."
36,Joey," That’s always appropriate! (Back to the matter at hand) Oh, okay. One
more push! One more push!"
40,Ross," (crying) I hope you’re a better father than you’re a friend!!
(Cries again and Joey wakes up in horror.)"
41,Rachel, (bursts into the room) Joey! Joey!
42,Joey, What? What’s going on?
43,Rachel, Come feel this! Come feel my belly!
44,Joey, Aaaah…
45,Rachel," Joey! The baby is kicking for the first time! Will you please come feel
this?!"
46,Joey, Really?!
47,Rachel, Yes!
49,Joey," Oh, y’know what? Maybe uh, you…you should come to me. I’m a
not, I’m not wearing any bottoms."
50,Rachel," Oh, okay! (She goes over to him and he feels her belly.)"
51,Joey," Oh my, oh my God!"
52,Rachel," Aw, it’s unbelievable! Wow! She is kicking so much! Oh, she’s
like umm…oh…who’s that kind of annoying girl soccer player?"
53,Joey, Mia Hamm?
54,Rachel, Mia Hamm!
55,Joey, Oh that’s amazing. (Drops the sheet.)
56,Rachel, (looking down) Oh-oh!! One hand on the sheet Joe!
57,Joey, Whoa-hey-oh! Sorry!
59,Chandler, Hey babe.
60,Monica," Hi honey. We just got a wedding gift from Bob and Faye Bing; they
don’t like us do they? (They gave them a pok-a-dotted punch bowl.)"
61,Chandler," Who says you can’t get a nice punch bowl for under six bucks?
Maybe we can take it back?"
62,Monica," No, it doesn’t say where it came from. Where would we return it?"
63,Chandler, How about to the street say from the balcony?
64,Monica, Why don’t we just find a place for it?
65,Chandler, Okay. How about in that cabinet?
66,Monica," No! That’s where we keep the canned goods! Have you completely
forgotten everything you learned at orientation?"
67,Chandler," How about the closet by the bathroom? (The secret green door by the
bathroom.)"
68,Monica," Oh, okay. Here, why don’t you let me do it?"
69,Chandler," Oh no-no-no, I will do it. Honey, you have to learn to sit down and
relax and let your husband take care of things once and awhile. (Tries the door.)
It’s locked, you have to help me. Why is it locked?"
70,Monica, No reason. I-I keep private things in there.
71,Chandler," Oh y’know, I’ve been living here a while and I’ve never
seen what’s inside that closet. What is, what is in there?"
72,Monica, Feminine stuff.
73,Chandler, Don’t try to make me uncomfortable with feminine stuff!
74,Monica," Chandler, there is nothing in there that concerns you! If you love me
you-you’ll let it go."
75,Chandler, Fine.
76,Monica, Thank you! (He tries the door again and Monica glares at him.)
77,Chandler, (walking casually away) Love you.
78,Phoebe," (entering) Hello Chandler, lovely day huh? (To Monica) You!"
79,Chandler," Phoebe if it helps Alexandra has only been massaging Monica for like
three years. (Phoebe rolls her eyes and walks away and Monica glares at him.) If! I said,
""If it helps!"" (Goes to the bedroom.)"
80,Phoebe, Why won’t you let me massage you?
81,Monica," Well it’s…I mean I’d just—I’d be
self-conscious. You’re my friend; I’d be naked."
82,Phoebe, Monica! We lived together for years! I’ve seen you naked!
83,Monica," That’s different, we were roommates! And when?!"
84,Phoebe, I’m curious about the human body.
85,Monica," Hey, come on Phoebe, you can understand why this would be weird for me."
86,Phoebe," But I’m a professional! And I’m really good! Look, if
you’re uncomfortable we can stop. Just give me a chance, okay. Please?"
87,Monica," Okay, if it means that much to you…"
88,Phoebe," It does! How would you feel if you couldn’t share your cooking?
Or-or imagine how Ross would feel if he couldn’t teach us about dragons."
89,Monica, Dinosaurs.
90,Phoebe," Potato, potaato. "
92,Ross, Hey!
93,Joey, Hey Ross! The baby’s kicking!
94,Ross," What?! It is?! (He tries to quickly remove his gloves, but runs into
trouble and finally throws them off of his hands like a hockey player in a fight and grabs
Rachel’s belly.)"
95,Rachel," It’s not kicking right now. Although we would love to see you do
(Mimics him) that again."
96,Ross," Hey, when-when was it kicking? What happened?"
97,Rachel," Last night! I just felt it and I went into Joey’s room and he was
sleeping…"
98,Joey, A dreamless sleep.
99,Ross," My God, the baby’s kicking. That’s great. Although I…kinda
wish I-I would’ve been there to feel the kicking for the first time y’know."
100,Joey, Well I got stuff going on in here (Rubbing his belly) if you wanna feel.
101,Ross," Look, I-I don’t want to miss anymore baby stuff. So…Here.
Here’s my new pager number, okay? Anytime anything pregnancy related happens use it!
I’ll be there! Okay? I don’t care if it’s three in the morning and all you
want is ice cream."
102,Joey, Wow! Can I get a copy of that?
104,Phoebe, (calling from her room) Are you under the sheet?
105,Monica, Yes. 
107,Phoebe," (in a soothing voice) Great, let’s begin. (She starts the massage.)
How’s the pressure?"
108,Monica, Nice! Wow Phoebe you are good!
109,Phoebe," Stating the obvious, but thank you. And it’s not weird is it."
110,Monica, No. Ooohh…
111,Phoebe," That’s right, you just enjoy."
112,Monica, (in a sexy voice) Oh. Oh yeah! Ohhhhh! Ohh! Oh yeah! 
113,Phoebe, (getting uncomfortable) Okay.
114,Monica," Oh God Phoebe!! (Phoebe covers one ear.) Oh that’s it! That’s
it! Right there! Oh! (Tries to cover the other ear.) Ooooh-oooh-ooooh… (Covers both
ears and continues the massage with her elbows.)"
116,Chandler," I wasn’t trying to open your closet! I wasn’t trying to open
your closet! I swear! (Running into the kitchen and sees its Joey.)"
117,Joey," Whoa, Monica runs a pretty tight ship over here. What are you doing?"
118,Chandler," Monica has a secret closet and she won’t let me see what’s
in it."
119,Joey, Why not?
120,Chandler," I don’t know! What could she possibly be hiding in here that I
can’t see?!"
121,Joey," I don’t know. Ooh, I bet it’s Richard."
122,Chandler, Why would Monica be keeping Richard in here?
123,Joey," Well off the top of my head uhh, maybe she’s having her cake and
eating it too. You being the cake and Richard being the too. Or!"
124,Chandler, And here we go…
125,Joey," I saw this movie once where there was a door and no one knew what was
behind it, and when they finally got it open millions and millions and millions of bugs
came pouring out and they feasted on human flesh. Y’know it wouldn’t kill ya to
respect your wife’s privacy! (He walks away and into his apartment and looks the
door.) Stupid closet full of bugs!"
126,Rachel," Joey. Joey, something feels weird and not good weird. I
don’t—Whoa!! (Winces in pain.)"
127,Joey," Oh hey whoa-whoa, don’t worry. Okay. When my sisters were pregnant
they got every weird feeling in the book, it was always nothing."
128,Rachel, Really?
129,Joey," Absolutely. But, we’re gonna stop by the hospital just to be
sure, okay? I’ll page Ross on the way. Come on."
130,Rachel, Okay. Oh God—Ow!—Oo!
131,Joey," Okay Rach-Rach-Rach look at me, look at me, everything’s gonna be
fine, trust me. Okay. Take my hand. Here we go. (Rachel grabs his hand.) Oww crushing
bones!"
133,Joey, Hey! So?
135,Rachel," Hmm, mild discomfort. So I take it you’ve had one of these Braxton
thingies?"
136,Joey, So but everything is normal.
138,Joey, And-and there’s no danger to her and the baby?
140,Rachel," Thank you doctor. (Dr. Long exits.) (To Joey) Oh thank you for being so
nice and calm."
141,Joey," Calm?! I wasn’t calm! I’ve never been more scared in all my
life!"
142,Rachel, But wait you said everything was gonna be okay.
143,Joey, Well what do I know?! I’m not a doctor!
144,Rachel, But I—But everything is okay. I’m fine!
145,Joey, You sure?!
146,Rachel," Yes! Yes! I got half a mind to contract that doctor’s uterus
though. Mild discomfort, what’s he talking about?"
147,Joey, (seeing Ross) Oh hey-hey!
148,Ross, (rushes in) Is everything okay?
149,Rachel," Yeah, everything’s fine!"
150,Ross," Your page said come to the hospital, what? What was it? What happened?"
151,Joey, Something called Braxton-Hicks contractions.
152,Ross," Oh. Oh. Thank God, most women don’t even feel them."
153,Rachel," Okay, no uterus, no opinion."
154,Joey," Hey uh, what’s with the candy?"
155,Ross," Oh when you beeped me I was on line at the concession stand at the movie
theater."
156,Rachel, Oh you went to the movies by yourself?
157,Ross, No I—Mona!
158,Rachel," Oh, I gotta go back in there."
159,Ross, What? Why? What’s wrong?
160,Rachel," No, everything’s fine. I just gotta go back…"
161,Ross," No really, you tell me what’s up."
162,Rachel, I-I forgot my underwear. (Ross lets her go.)
163,Ross," (To Joey) So, thanks so much for bringing her to the hospital."
164,Joey," Oh hey, don’t worry about it man. Don’t worry about it, no big
deal."
165,Ross," Yeah but still, I mean it should’ve been me. I’m the dad."
167,Joey," Oh uh, hey. Not as good as this guy! (Grabs Ross around the shoulders.) He
brought Twizlers!"
170,Chandler, There has got to be a way!
171,Joey," Easy there Captain Kirk. Oh, do you have a bobby pin?"
172,Chandler," Yeah. (Checks his hair.) Oh no wait, I’m not an nine-year-old
girl."
173,Joey, Then why do you throw like one?
174,Chandler, Maybe Monica has a bobby pin.
175,Joey," Sure. ""Monica."""
176,Chandler," So, how’s the hideously inappropriate crush on Rachel coming?"
177,Joey," Uh, really good. Really good. Yeah, I should be ready to kill myself any
day now. (Chandler returns with a bobby pin and hands it to Joey.) Wow, you sure found
that quick. (He tries the pin in the lock.) I just—I wish I didn’t feel this way
about Rachel anymore, y’know? I wish things could go back to normal. I mean, I love
living with her and God, helping out with the baby is just amazing, but now I think…I
think Ross feels left out. Y’know? When I had to take Rachel to the hospital, the
doctor thought I was the father. God… You should’ve seen the look on Ross’s
face. (Pause) By the way, I have no idea what I’m doing here. For all I know I’m
just locking it more. Oh hey, did you try opening it with a credit card?"
178,Chandler, That’s a good idea.
179,Joey, Yeah.
180,Chandler," Okay. (They switch places and Chandler gets out a credit card.) So uh,
Ross is kinda bummed huh?"
181,Joey," Oh, I just…I feel terrible."
182,Chandler," Well, it’s not your fault. What are you gonna do? Not take her to
the hospital? Y’know? You’re doing nothing wrong. (Pause) Except for harboring
an all consuming love for the woman whose carrying his baby. (He loses his card behind the
door.) Richard? If-if you’re in there, could you pass me my credit card?"
184,Monica, Hey.
185,Phoebe, Hey.
186,Monica," I gotta tell you, yesterday was amazing. That massage felt so good!"
187,Phoebe," No-no, I got that."
188,Monica," So umm, what do you say we make it a weekly appointment?"
189,Phoebe," Okay. Okay but you should know though, I’ve raised my rates to $200
an hour."
190,Monica, Okay.
191,Phoebe, I mean $500.
192,Monica, What?
193,Phoebe, 600.
194,Monica, What’s going on?
195,Phoebe," Oh, you make sex noises when you get massaged!"
196,Monica, What? (Laughs.)
197,Phoebe," Yeah, and it really freaked me out! And after a while I even tried to
hurt you and it just spurred you on."
198,Monica," What?! You’re crazy! There’s nothing sexual about the noises I
make!"
199,Phoebe," Really? There’s nothing sexual about this? (Sexily) Oooh. Oo God!
Ohh. Ohhhh. Ohh. (Some cute guy is watching closely.) (To him) What are you looking at?!
(Pause) I mean hi."
200,Monica," Oh my—This is so embarrassing. Oh my God, I’m never gonna get
massaged again!"
201,Phoebe," No, you can’t let this stop you from getting massages! No look, I
have, I have lots of clients that make the same noises you do!"
202,Monica, Really?!
203,Phoebe," Well not clients, lovers. But let’s just y’know, try it again.
Come back and-and we’ll work through it."
204,Monica, Are you sure?
205,Phoebe, Yes.
206,Monica, I guess.
207,Phoebe," Great! Okay, if you’ll just excuse me. (To the guy) So, did you
hear something you liked?"
209,Rachel, Hey Ross! Check it out! I learned a new trick!
210,Ross," Hey uh, I brought you some lunch."
211,Rachel," Ohh! That’s so sweet of you! Oh yum! (Takes a bite out of the
sandwich and starts to get sick.) Did you put pickles on this?"
212,Ross, Well yeah!
213,Rachel, Oh Ross!! (Runs to the bathroom and closes the door.)
214,Ross, What?! What?! Rach what?!
215,Joey, What’s going on?
216,Ross," I made her favorite, tuna salad with pickles."
217,Joey, Pickle? Pickles make her sick. Giving her pickles is like giving me salad.
218,Ross," (to Rachel) I-I’m sorry Rach, I didn’t know. Are you gonna be
okay?"
219,Rachel," Yeah, I’ll be fine. But could someone please make sure that
sandwich is gone when I get out there?"
220,Joey, I’m on it! (Takes a bite out of the sandwich.)
221,Ross," I can’t believe this! I shouldn’t be the one making her throw
up!"
222,Joey, Dude relax! It could happen to anyone.
223,Ross," Yeah? Not to you, because you know this stuff. I don’t know any of it
and I’m the father. I wish I’d be more involved y’know."
224,Rachel," (entering) Well, if anyone is keeping score, I no longer eat tuna."
225,Joey," Hey uh, can I, can I talk to you guys for a second?"
226,Ross, Yeah.
227,Rachel, What’s up?
228,Joey," Uh, sit down. I wanna talk about our situation."
229,Rachel, (Gasps) Are you breaking up with us?
230,Joey," The thing is…’cause I live with Rachel I’m here for a lot
of the stuff, okay? (To Rachel) And Ross…Ross is missing everything. So…"
231,Rachel, Yeah?
232,Joey, Maybe you two should live together.
233,Rachel, Are you asking me to move out? Do you not want me here?
234,Joey," Oh no-no, no-no I love living with you. It just seems that…if
you’re gonna have a roommate, y’know it might as well be the father."
235,Rachel," But Joey, I don’t think Ross wants me to move into his apartment
and disrupt his life like that. I mean—(Ross turns to her with wishful eyes.)—Or
he does."
236,Ross," No I-I-I would love to be around for you and the baby. And we-we can just
try it like on a temporary basis."
237,Rachel," But Ross, its you and me!"
238,Ross," So? Sure! But it-it wouldn’t be anything romantic. And
I’m-I’m dating Mona—Damnit Mona! I was supposed to meet her like an hour
ago! What is wrong with me?!"
239,Joey," All right now, so? What do you think?"
240,Rachel, I don’t know. Is it crazy?
241,Ross," No! No it’s not. Joey, this is a smart idea."
242,Joey," Well, I was due."
243,Rachel," Okay, let’s do it. I’ll move in."
244,Ross, Really?
245,Rachel, Yeah.
246,Ross," Oh Rach that’s great. That’s great. (They hug and Joey breathes
a sigh of relief.)"
248,Chandler," Not to shabby, I got this all off myself…using my wife’s
tools. (He takes the door off the frame and we finally get to see what’s behind the
green door! It is stacked, floor to ceiling, with junk.) Oh my God!"
249,Monica, (entering) (Gasps) How did you get in there?!
250,Chandler, (laughs) You’re messy.
251,Monica, Oh no! You weren’t supposed to see this!
252,Chandler, I married Fred Sanford!
253,Monica," No Chandler, you don’t understand! (Chandler starts singing the
theme for Sanford and Son, an old TV show starring Redd Fox.) Okay! Okay! Okay!
Fine! Now you know. Okay? I’m y’know…I’m sick."
254,Chandler," No, honey you’re not sick! Look, I don’t love you because
you’re organized, I love you in spite of that."
255,Monica, Really? You promise you won’t tell anyone?
256,Chandler," Yes! And look, now that I know if I got some extra stuff lying around
can we, can we share the closet."
257,Monica, Well…it’s just umm…I’m afraid you might mess it up.
259,Chandler, Hey.
260,Joey, Hey.
261,Chandler, So Rachel’s all moved out huh? How are you taking it?
262,Joey," Well uh, I wanted to have a few beers, but uh, I got rid of those because
Rachel couldn’t stand the smell of them. But I have thrown back a lot of orange juice
with calcium though. And uh, it’s a couple weeks past it’s expiration date, so
it’s got a bit of a kick."
263,Chandler, Are you okay?
264,Joey," Are you kidding me? I’m great! Yeah, I’m uh; I’m better
than great. I am good. And now that she’s gone, I can uh, I can do all this stuff
around here that I couldn’t do before. Y’know? Like umm, I can walk around naked
again. Y’know? I can uh, I can watch porn in the living room. Right? This is uh, this
is good for me. Y’know? I like being on my own, I’m uh, better off this way.
I’m uh, a lone wolf. Y’know? A loner. Alone. All alone. Forever. What’s a
wolf got to do to get a huh around here?! (Chandler rushes over and hugs him.)"
267,Monica, Ohhh.
268,Phoebe, That’s it. Just relax.
269,Monica, Ohh. Oh! Ohh!
270,Phoebe, Come on more!
271,Monica, Oh God!
272,Phoebe," Yeah, you like that don’t you?"
273,Monica, Oh yeah right there!
274,Phoebe, You want it there? You take it there baby!
275,Monica, Uh Phoebe?
276,Phoebe," Yeah, say my name. Say it! (She stops when she realizes what she’s
doing.) And now I’m going to cover you back up, and umm we’re never doing this
again."

it’s Rachel?"
12,Joey, Yes.
13,Ross," Um, you…you like Rachel?"
14,Joey, Yes. I like Rachel.
15,Ross, Rachel?!
16,Joey," (startled) Yeah, okay but look, buy uh—Hey-hey, y’know,
y’know who else I like? You! And it-it doesn’t get said enough. I like you Ross."
17,Ross, But R-R-Rachel-Rachel?! 
18,Joey," Yeah, but it’s not a big deal."
19,Ross," It’s not a big deal? Oh, I’m sorry I just…um, I…what
about all the stuff you-you just said? I mean how about, I like—you-you can’t
stop thinking about her. Like how you can’t sleep?"
20,Joey," I’m an actor, y’know? As-as a group, we tend to be over
dramatic."
21,Ross, Rachel who’s carrying my baby? Rachel?
22,Joey," Look no, I-I know it’s bad, and I know it’s wrong. Okay? But-but
it’s not like anything’s ever gonna happen. Y’know? These-these are just
feelings, they’re gonna go away."
23,Ross, Y’know what? I-I gotta go. (Starts to leave.)
24,Joey, Oh come on Ross! Hey Ross-Ross don’t…
25,Ross, (stops) I just—y’know—I-I just have one—Rachel?! 
30,Rachel," Oh-oh! Okay, she’s kicking!"
31,Chandler, Oh! (Puts his hand on her belly.) She’s growing inside you.
32,Rachel, Whoa!!
33,Chandler, Oh! (Pulls his hand away.)
34,Rachel, Wow that was a big one.
35,Chandler, I think that’s the youngest girl ever to reject me.
36,Phoebe, (entering) Oh hey you guys!
37,Chandler, Oh hey!
38,Rachel, Hi!
39,Phoebe," Hey listen let me ask you, do you believe in soul mates?"
40,Rachel," Oh yes I do. I do. I believe that there is one perfect person out there
for everyone. And do you know how you find him? You stop looking for him. That’s why
I stopped looking for Russell Crowe. He’ll find me."
41,Phoebe," Uh-huh, (To Chandler) and you?"
42,Chandler," No. I mean I believe that uh, certain people are more suited for each
other and I believe in falling in love, but soul mates, I don’t think they exist."
43,Phoebe," Okay, good."
44,Chandler, Why?
45,Phoebe," Well last night, I met Monica’s."
46,Chandler, What?
47,Phoebe," Yeah, I had a date with this guy, and I swear to God, he is her other
half."
48,Chandler," Come on, don’t be crazy. (To Rachel) You don’t think
there’s someone out there better suited for Monica than me, do ya? (Rachel looks at
him.)"
49,Rachel," (To Phoebe) Well, what’s he like?!"
50,Phoebe, Well he’s tall.
51,Rachel, Uh-huh.
52,Phoebe, He has brown hair.
53,Rachel," Of course, of course."
54,Chandler," A tall guy with hair similar to mine, oh unknowable universe!"
55,Phoebe, He works with food!
56,Rachel, Oh sure. Older?
57,Phoebe," Obviously, and he’s British."
58,Rachel," Oh, I was just gonna ask!"
59,Phoebe," Yeah? And, he’s-he’s so centered and mature and confident."
60,Rachel," Oh, it’s so sad they never had a chance to meet."
61,Chandler," Luckily, the guy she settled for can’t hear what you’re
talking about."
62,Phoebe," Oh, I’m so sorry. Um, and maybe I’m wrong! I
but—y’know I’m gonna go out with him again, I’ll find out more."
63,Chandler," You believe that this guy is destined for someone else and you’re
still gonna date him?"
64,Phoebe," Well, he may not be my soul mate, but a girl’s gotta eat."
66,Monica, Hey.
67,Ross, Hey.
68,Monica," I just talked to Joey, I just—I want to see how you were."
69,Ross," Oh y’know, I still—I can’t believe it. Joey and Rachel I
mean it’s… It’s like you and me going out, only weirder!"
70,Monica," All right, I know you’re hurting, and-and I want to be supportive,
but don’t say that again."
71,Ross," Oh my God! What if, what if they get married? Then he’d be the
stepfather of my child."
72,Monica," Honey, I don’t think that’s something we need to worry about!
First of all he’s-he’s never gonna tell her how he feels about her. And even if
he did you have no idea how she’d react."
73,Ross," Sure, because women never like Joey. Y’know, I think he’s a
virgin."
74,Monica, Joey…he’s not even thinking about going after Rachel!
75,Ross, He’s not?
76,Monica," No! All he’s thinking about is how you’re taking this! I mean,
listen it’s totally freaking him out. He’s talking about moving to Vermont."
77,Ross, Why?
78,Monica, He says he wants to leave the country. (Pause) He thinks you hate him.
79,Ross," Hate him? I… No, I don’t hate him. (Pause) It’s just
it’s Rachel, y’know?"
80,Monica," Honey I can’t even imagine how hard this must be for you. But, I
don’t want you to lose Joey over it. And right now he just needs to know that
you’re still his friend."
81,Ross," Okay. Okay, I’ll talk to him."
82,Monica," All right. Now do it soon, he just asked me how to convert his dollars
into Vermont money."
84,Phoebe, Oh! Hi!
85,Monica, Hi!
86,Phoebe," Umm, Chandler, Monica, this is Don."
88,Phoebe, (mouths to Chandler) Soul mate.
89,Chandler, (mouths to Phoebe) What?
90,Phoebe, (cough talks) Soul mate.
91,Monica," So, what have you guys been doing?"
93,Monica," I know! What is this, 1985?!"
95,Monica, Not really.
96,Chandler," What’s wrong with sun-dried tomatoes? (Everyone stares at him.)
On a barbecue chicken pizza? (Still there’s staring.) No?"
97,Monica," So Don, what-what other restaurants do you like?"
99,Monica," Oh my God! That’s my restaurant, I’m the chef there."
101,Monica, No!
103,Monica," Oh, I’d like a latte. Oh y’know what? If you’re gonna
talk about me, I’m gonna go with you. "
105,Chandler, What are you doing?!
106,Phoebe," Nothing! I swear to God I didn’t know you guys would be here! And
the good news is you didn’t believe in soul mates. So…"
107,Chandler," I believe in tall, handsome strangers who hit on my wife!"
108,Phoebe," They’re just talking, and y’know what? Just because I think
they’re soul mates doesn’t mean anything’s gonna happen."
109,Monica," (returning) Phoebe, good work."
110,Phoebe, Yeah?
111,Monica," Yeah! Oh he’s great, I love him. (Walks away and Chandler glares at
Phoebe.)"
112,Phoebe," Don’t worry, we’ll find you someone else."
114,Joey, Hey.
115,Ross, Hey.
116,Joey," Look, I understand if you came by to hit me, I deserve it."
117,Ross," No, I don’t want to hit you."
118,Joey, Oh what then? Kick me?
119,Ross, No.
120,Joey, (getting worried) Bite me?
121,Ross," No, no I don’t want to do anything to you. All right? I just want to
tell you that I’m not mad at you and…and that I certainly do not hate you. I
just, I just came here to say that. (Starts to leave.)"
122,Joey," Oh now—Hey Ross-Ross! Do you wanna-wanna come in for a beer or
something?"
123,Ross, Uh…yeah sure. (Enters.)
124,Joey," Do uh, do you got any beer? All-all I got is this melon stuff that Rachel
left. I don’t…"
125,Ross, Okay.
126,Joey," (pouring two glasses) Hey look Ross, you need to understand something
okay? I uh…I am never gonna act on this Rachel thing, okay? I-I would never do
anything to jeopardize my friendship with you. (He hands Ross a glass.)"
127,Ross, Thank you.
129,Joey," Anyway, it uh…look it’ll just…take me a while to get over
her, that’s all. I’m not even sure how to do that, I mean I’ve never been
in love before so…"
130,Ross, What?! You’re in love with her.
131,Joey," Yeah, I thought you knew that."
132,Ross," Umm, no."
133,Joey," Wow. Hey look, if it helps, I don’t want to feel this way. Honest. I
just keep thinking, ""Ah, I’ll get over this."" Y’know? I just—It
just keeps gettin’ harder. I don’t, I don’t know what to do. Y’know?
What do I do?"
135,Ross, I think you need to tell her how you feel.
136,Joey, Okay that’s the green stuff talkin’.
137,Ross," No, I’m serious. You-you need to find out where she is, because if
she’s not where you are, then you can start to move past this."
138,Joey, But what if uh—and I’m not saying she will be—But…
139,Ross," If she is where you are then uh…then my feeling weird about it
shouldn’t stand in the way."
140,Joey, Are you sure?
141,Ross," Yeah. Look if-if she’s gonna end up with somebody else, the truth is
she couldn’t find a better guy. So…"
142,Joey, Hey thanks.
143,Ross, So when do you think you’re gonna talk to her?
144,Joey," Oh my God I have to tell her! I haven’t even thought about what I
will say. What should I say?"
145,Ross," I’m understanding, but let’s not get carried away."
146,Joey," I’m sorry, you’re right. What am I gonna say? (He takes another
sip of the green stuff and recoils at the taste.) Oh!"
147,Ross," Yeah, tell me about it. (He stands up, turns his back to Joey, and enjoys
another sip.)"
151,Chandler," Cheese you say? That’s some pretty smelly work, huh Don?"
153,Chandler," Cheese, it’s smelly. You must smell a lot of the time too."
155,Monica," Me too! Yeah, Chandler can’t stand it. He won’t even allow me
to have blue cheese in the house."
157,Monica," You know what I’d love to do? I would like to go to France and eat
nothing but bread and cheese—Not even bread, just cheese. No, I want the bread. Yeah.
Ah, and pastries… (Breathlessly) And pate. Oh, I’m really not high, it’s
just I used to be fat."
159,Chandler, Is it made of cheese?
161,Monica, I’d move in tomorrow!
162,Chandler, (disgusted) Oh come on! (To Phoebe) Are you listening to this?
163,Phoebe, I’m so sorry.
164,Chandler, What do we do?
165,Phoebe," I don’t know, they both want to live in a house of cheese! I
don’t know how you fight that."
167,Joey," Okay. Okay, I can do this. I can tell her how I feel. Just uh, just stand
up straight. (Does so.) Take a couple deep breaths. (Does so.) Look confident. (Does so as
Rachel opens the door and startles him.)"
168,Rachel, Joey? What’s up?
169,Joey," I uh, I just came by because I-I want to talk to you about something."
170,Rachel, Okay what’s up?
171,Joey, Here? In the hall? What are we animals?
172,Rachel," Well honey, I’m late for a meeting. So can you just make it quick?"
173,Joey," Okay umm, I just came by to tell you that I…want to have dinner with
you tonight. That’s all."
174,Rachel," Sure! That sounds great! Just leave me a message and tell me where to
meet you. Okay? (Walks away.)"
175,Joey," Okay. That’s good. Okay, that give you a couple hours to prepare what
you’re gonna say. Good. Yeah. (Someone comes out of his apartment and it startles
Joey again.) Don’t you people ever knock?!"
177,Monica, I’d like to have Don and Phoebe over. Wouldn’t that be nice?
178,Chandler," Sure, why don’t you set it up. I’ll just be over here,
browsing through the personals."
179,Monica, Are you okay? You’ve been acting weird all afternoon.
180,Chandler," Yeah, fine. Fine. Not perfect!! But good enough."
181,Monica, Jeez! What is with you?
182,Chandler," I’m sorry, did you say cheese?"
183,Monica," All right, what’s going on?"
184,Chandler," Phoebe thinks you and Don are soul mates, and I don’t believe in
that kind of stuff. But then you two totally get along. So look, I won’t stand in
your way if you want to run off with Don and live in a house of cheese."
185,Monica," Chandler, you don’t believe in soul mates?"
186,Chandler, No. But I’m sure (mimics Don) ‘tomatoes’ does.
187,Monica, I don’t believe in soul mates either.
188,Chandler, You don’t?
189,Monica," No. I don’t think that you and I were destined to end up together.
I think that we fell in love and work hard at our relationship. Some days we work really
hard."
190,Chandler, So you…you don’t want to live with Don in a cheese house?
191,Monica," No, I’ve had second thoughts about that. Do you realize how hard
that would be to clean?"
192,Chandler, I love you.
193,Monica, I know.
194,Chandler," Y’know what? I am going to take you out to dinner tonight. I
found this place that makes the greatest mozzarella sticks and jalepino poppers . (Monica
doesn’t look impressed.) No? Really? They taste so good."
196,Rachel," …and I know Chandler is kidding but it happens every time he
touches my stomach. I mean I’m really worried the baby’s not going to like him.
(Joey is staring at the table.) Are you okay?"
197,Joey," What? Yeah! Sure! Uh, look at the uh, the reason…(Exhales
slowly)—Is it hot in here?"
198,Rachel," No. Not-not for me, but why don’t you take off your sweater?"
199,Joey," I would, but this is a nice place and my T-shirt has a picture of Calvin
doing Hobbs."
200,Rachel, Oh my God! Really?! Can I see it?
201,Joey," Yeah. Sure. (They both half stand up, Joey pulls the neck of his sweater
out, and Rachel looks down it to see his T-shirt.)"
202,Rachel," Huh. Wow, I wouldn’t think Hobbs would like that so much."
203,Joey, Uh… How long have we known each other?
204,Rachel," Um, seven…e-e-eight, eight years. Wow."
205,Joey," Uh-huh, long time."
206,Rachel, Yeah.
207,Joey, But over the past few weeks…
210,Joey," Actually uh, could you give us a second?"
212,Rachel, So you were saying?
213,Joey, I’m not quite sure.
214,Rachel," Okay, well you had asked me how long we had known each other, and I
said, ""Eight years."" And the um, waiter came over and cut his tip in half, and
umm…now here we are."
215,Joey," Yeah, here we are. Uhh… I… I think I’m…falling in love
with you."
216,Rachel, (stunned) What?
217,Joey, I’m falling in love with you.
218,Rachel," (looking around) Who are you talking too? Oh, you’re kidding! Oh,
it’s a joke! (Laughs.) It’s funny. It’s funny. I don’t get it. (Joey
doesn’t say any thing and Rachel realizes it’s not a joke.) Oh. (Pause) Okay.
Umm… I-I…uh, wow. Are you uh… How did umm… When?"
219,Joey, Does it really matter?
220,Rachel," Wow! Wow. Wow. Wow, it is hot in here."
221,Joey," Okay look Rach, I know this is a lot. You don’t have to say anything.
You-you uh, you take as much time as you need. (Long pause as Rachel says nothing.) Okay,
you gotta say something!"
222,Rachel," Joey, Joey I love you so much, but I…"
223,Joey, But. (Hangs his head down.)
224,Rachel, Joey.
225,Joey," Yeah-yeah right. That’s okay. That’s fine. That’s uh,
pretty much what I was expecting. So uh, it’s no big deal. All right? I think
I’m gonna go. (Stands up.)"
226,Rachel," No! Joey please! Please don’t! Please don’t leave like this!
Now come on, you cannot do this to a pregnant woman! (Starts to cry.)"
227,Joey," Don’t start doing that. You can’t do that Rach, ‘cause then
you’re gonna make me do that. (Starts to cry.) Oh, here we go! (Sits down next to
her.)"
228,Rachel, Can I? (Hug him.)
229,Joey, Sure! 
231,Rachel, Oh Joey honey I don’t…I don’t want to lose…
232,Joey," Hey-hey-hey, hey! You can’t. Okay? Ever!"
233,Rachel, I’m so sorry.
234,Joey," Oh no-no Rach, please, don’t be sorry. Okay? Don’t be sorry.
(They hug again.) Y’know I was only kidding you."
235,Rachel," Yeah, that was a real good one."
0,Rachel, Joey? Are you in there?
2,Joey, (hearing Rachel and jumping up with his plate) Oh God! That’s Rachel!
3,Monica," Joey, you have to talk to her!"
4,Joey," No-no, I can’t! I can’t! Not after the other night, it’s
just it’s…too weird, okay? Don’t tell her I’m here! (Turns to run to
the bathroom and his bagel falls off the plate onto the floor.) Don’t eat that! (Runs
to the bathroom as Rachel enters.)"
5,Rachel, Hey!
6,Chandler, Hey!
7,Monica, Hey Rachel!
8,Rachel, Is Joey here?
9,Chandler, I don’t see him. (To Monica) Do you see him?
10,Monica," I don’t see him. Hey! Maybe he’s in the sugar bowl! (Opens the
sugar bowl) Joey? Nope! (Closes the sugar bowl and they both laugh.)"
11,Rachel," Well, at least you make each other laugh."
12,Monica, What’s up?
13,Rachel," Well, I haven’t seen him since that night that he told me how he
y’know… I don’t know, I think he’s avoiding me. Why is that bagel on
the floor?"
14,Monica, We were playing a game.
15,Rachel," Ew, was Chandler naked? Sort of like a, like a ring toss kind of
situation?"
16,Monica, Sure.
17,Chandler, What?! No! No!
18,Rachel," All right. Well listen, if you see Joey will you just tell him
uh…tell him I miss him. (Exits and Joey enters.)"
19,Monica," (To Joey) Okay, did you hear that?"
20,Joey," Yeah, a naked bagel game? (Picks up his dropped bagel.) (To Chandler)
Dude, I don’t know. That’s a pretty small hole."
21,Monica," Honey, you gotta talk to her."
22,Joey," I can’t! Y’know? You guys don’t know what it’s like to
put yourself out there like that and just get shot down."
23,Chandler," (incredulous) I don’t know what that’s like?! Up until I was
25 I thought the only response to, ""I love you,"" was, ""Oh crap!"""
24,Monica," Hello? No rejection? I got shot down at fat camp! Boy, kids are mean
when they’re hungry."
25,Joey," All right so, so what do I do?"
26,Monica," This is Rachel. I mean, what are you gonna do, never going to talk to
her again? I mean I know it’s weird, it’s awkward, but you gotta at least try."
27,Joey," Yeah. Okay. (Goes to take a bite out of the previously mentioned bagel.)
Whoa! (Stops.) I almost forgot this was on your…"
28,Chandler, (interrupting him) We didn’t play it!!
31,Phoebe," Okay, so when you’re done with your tea I’ll look at your
leaves and tell you your fortune."
32,Chandler, I didn’t know you read tea leaves.
33,Phoebe," Oh yeah, I’ve done it for years. I actually stopped because I was
so accurate. Y’know, and-and y’know, one of the great joys of life is
it’s-it’s wondrous unpredictability. Y’know? And also tea tends to give me
the trots."
34,Monica," Okay, I’m done. Read mine."
35,Phoebe," Okay. (Looks at the leaves.) Ooh, I see a ladder. (Checks the book)
Which can mean either a promotion or a violent death."
36,Monica, (stunned) I-I’m the head chef. I-I can’t get promoted.
37,Phoebe," Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm, who’s next?"
38,Rachel," Okay, I’m done. Do mine."
39,Phoebe," Okay. (Reads the leaves) Umm, oh! Okay, I see a circle."
40,Rachel, Ah.
41,Phoebe," Oh! (Checking the book) Which can either mean you’re having a baby
or you’re gonna make a scientific discovery!"
42,Rachel," Well, I have been spending a lot of time in the lab."
43,Chandler, What does yours say Pheebs?
44,Phoebe," Umm… Wow, all right. (Checks the book.) Wow! Yay! Ooh, I’m
gonna meet a guy! And really soon! And he’s gonna be the man of my dreams. Probably
not the guy I had a dream about last night. (Points at Chandler.)"
45,Ross," (entering) Hey! Has anyone seen my shirt? It’s a button down, like a,
like a faded salmon?"
46,Monica, You mean your pink shirt?
47,Ross, Faded salmon color.
48,Monica," No, I-I haven’t seen your pink shirt."
49,Ross, Great! Great. Then I must’ve left it at Mona’s. I knew it!
50,Chandler," Well, I’m sure you get another one at Ann Taylor’s."
51,Ross, That’s my favorite shirt! Okay? I love that shirt!
52,Rachel, Well just ask Mona to give it back!
53,Ross," I don’t know. I mean I-I guess I could. It’s just that we
didn’t really end things such good terms. And if I go over there I’d be ignoring
the one thing she asked me to do when we broke up, jump up my own ass and die. (Walks
away.)"
54,Phoebe," (noticing a guy sitting by the green post looking at her) Oh wait a
second you guys…for the last couple weeks I’ve been that guy everywhere I go. We
take the same bus. We go to the same bookstore, the same dry cleaners; maybe he’s the
tea guy. (He gets up to leave, and smiles at Phoebe.)"
55,Chandler," Phoebe, did you see that?! He totally checked you out! He is so cute!
(Looking at his tea.) Mine has a picture of The Village People, what does that
mean?"
57,Rachel, Hi!
58,Joey, Hey.
60,Rachel, Hi.
61,Joey, Hi.
63,Monica, Tea gives Phoebe the trots.
65,Rachel," So I thought Joey and I would be okay once we hung out, but it’s
not even like we know how to be with each other anymore."
66,Chandler," I know it’s tough now, but things will get better."
67,Rachel," How do you know that? What if it just gets worse and worse and worse, to
the point where we can’t even be in the same room with each other?!"
68,Chandler," I’m not great at the advice, can I interest you in a sarcastic
comment? Some cheese?"
69,Monica," Honey, what is the Bruce Springsteen CD in the Kat Stevens case?"
70,Chandler," Let’s just say if I can’t find the right CD case I just put
it in the nearest one."
71,Monica," Okay, where is the Kat Stevens CD?"
72,Chandler, In the James Taylor case.
73,Monica, Where is the James Taylor CD?
74,Chandler," Honey, I’m gonna save you some time, 200 CDs, not one of them in
the right case."
75,Monica," Okay. No need to panic. Deep breathes everyone. Okay umm uh, we’re
just gonna have to spend some time and put the CDs in the right cases."
76,Chandler," Well, if we’re gonna do that we should come up with some kind of
order. Y’know alphabetically or by genre?"
77,Monica," Hmm, I don’t know. We really have to talk this through."
78,Rachel, Oh my God!! You guys have such problems!! I feel so terrible for you!
79,Monica," Okay, I-I’m sorry. You and Joey, your both focusing on this
uncomfortable thing, what you need to do is to change the subject. Next time you see him
try to get him talking about something else."
80,Rachel, Oh yeah. That makes sense.
81,Monica," Yeah, like I don’t know, maybe you have a work problem that you
need his advice on."
82,Rachel," Ooh, I can do that."
83,Monica," Good. (To Chandler) Uh honey, the Miami Vice soundtrack? Really?"
84,Chandler," They were just giving those away at the store (off Monica’s look)
in exchange for money."
85,Joey, (entering) Hey!
86,Rachel, Hi.
87,Monica," Uh I really don’t know what to tell you Rach, I really don’t.
I mean, maybe Joey can help you out with your, with your big work problem."
88,Rachel, What?
89,Monica," Yeah Joey she’s…Rachel’s got this really big work
problem, and it is a head scratcher. Wow! (To Chandler) Y’know what, if we’re
gonna make dinner we’re gonna have to leave. Yeah. (She and Chandler exit.)"
90,Joey," So you uh, have a…big work problem?"
91,Rachel," Yeah it’s umm… Yeah it’s uh… It-it’s
y’know—It’s nothing."
92,Joey," Huh. Okay. (Awkward silence.) So uh, I think I’m gonna take off."
93,Rachel," Yeah—No wait! Joey no wait it is. It’s something.
It’s-it’s umm…it’s my boss."
94,Joey, Yeah?
95,Rachel," Yeah, and umm my baby."
96,Joey, Yeah?
97,Rachel, My boss wants to buy my baby!
98,Joey, What?! Oh my-oh my God!
99,Rachel," I know I told you, it’s a really big problem."
100,Joey, What he wants to buy your baby?!
101,Rachel, Can you believe that?!
102,Joey, That’s crazy!
103,Rachel, That’s what I told him!
104,Joey," Okay, how did this even happen?"
105,Rachel," Well I’ll tell ya! (Pause) See uh my-my boss and his
wife—They-they can’t have children. So umm, and that—we were at the
Christmas party, and he got drunk, and he said to me, ""Rachel, I want to buy your
baby."""
106,Joey," Man! When you said it was a problem about your boss and the baby I figured
it was something about maternity leave."
107,Rachel," Ohh! Yeah! (Pause) Yeah that-that would’ve been a much simpler
problem."
109,Phoebe, Oh hello.
111,Phoebe," Oh Jim, Jim Nelson I’m Phoebe, Phoebe Buffay. We certainly have
been seeing a lot of each other lately. "
113,Phoebe," Well, maybe we will. (Starts to walk away.) Oh! (She turns around and
the exchange information.)"
115,Ross," Mona? (There’s no answer, so he starts to leave but remembers where
her extra key is. He reaches atop a hall light just outside her door and grabs the key. He
looks at in triumph as the pain from it being hot moves along his nervous system to his
brain, and when it arrives his brain orders his hand to drop the hot key and his mouth to
squeal in pain. After dropping the key he pulls his shirtsleeve over his hand and uses the
key to open the door and enter Mona’s apartment.) Okay, if I were a salmon shirt,
where would I be? (He hears a key in the door and as it opens he dives behind the couch.)"
123,Chandler," Oh my God, honey we are so meant to be together. We both have copies
of the Annie soundtrack."
124,Monica," Honey, both yours."
125,Rachel, (entering) Hey! Great advice on that Joey thing!
126,Monica, Yeah? The work problem?
127,Rachel, Oh it was perfect! I mean it really felt like he was my friend again.
128,Chandler, What problem did you tell him you had?
129,Rachel," Oh that’s not important. The point is, I really—I think
everything’s gonna be okay."
132,Joey, Do you think you can just buy my friends baby?!
135,Phoebe," Isn’t it funny how we kept running into each other? It’s as if
someone really wants us to be together."
137,Phoebe," Oh, witty banter. Well done."
139,Phoebe," Oh okay, well I’m a masseuse, and I used to work at this
place…"
141,Phoebe," I-I-I like, I like parties."
143,Phoebe," Yeah I guess, a little."
145,Phoebe," (a little freaked out) So! Umm, anyway I-I lived in New York, someone
wildly I guess, for umm—Well since I was fourteen."
147,Phoebe, Oh stop it.
149,Phoebe," Okay. Umm look, you’re coming on a little strong. But I’m
going to give you the benefit of the doubt, because it seems the universe really wants to
be together. So, why don’t we just start over okay? And you can just tell me about
yourself."
151,Phoebe, Okay.
153,Phoebe, What?!
155,Phoebe, Oh my God!
157,Phoebe, Wow! You do?
159,Phoebe, All right. (Gets up and walks out.)
161,Chandler," (singing) The sun’ll come out…tomorrow! Bet…your
bottom dollar that tomorrow… (The girls start laughing, and in a deep voice) …there’ll
be sun."
162,Joey, (entering) Hey!
163,Rachel," Hey! Oh Joey, honey listen, thank you for talking to my yesterday about
that thing with my boss. That really meant a lot."
164,Joey," Not a problem. Oh, and just so you know, that guy’s not going to be
bothering you about that baby thing anymore."
165,Rachel, (worried) What?
166,Joey, Let’s just say I took care of it.
167,Rachel," Whoa-whoa-whoa, let’s say more!"
168,Joey," Don’t worry! Don’t worry. I just told him, very nicely,
""You don’t go buying people’s babies, so back off!!"""
169,Rachel, What?!
171,Rachel," No! No, no-no-no Joey he doesn’t want to buy my baby! I made that
up!"
172,Joey, What?! Why?!
173,Rachel," So that we would have something to talk about! So it wouldn’t be
awkward!"
174,Joey, And you couldn’t think of anything else?!
175,Monica, You said your boss wants to buy your baby?!
176,Rachel," (To Joey) I can’t believe that you yelled at my boss!
I’m-I’m gonna lose my job! What am I going to do?!"
177,Chandler, You can always sell your baby.
178,Rachel," Oh Joey, I can’t believe you brought my boss into this! I’m
gonna get fired!"
179,Joey, You lied to me!
180,Rachel," Well, she told me too! (Points to Monica and Joey glares at her.)"
181,Monica, Chandler has two copies of Annie!
184,Ross, Hello!!
186,Ross, Not touching myself if that makes anyone less uncomfortable.
188,Rachel, Morning. You wanted to see me?
190,Rachel, Okay look Mr. Zelner…
192,Rachel, Yeah. (Motions for him to continue.)
194,Rachel, Oh God.
196,Rachel," Well, as long as we are clear about that. (Exits smugly.)"
198,Phoebe, Oh there it is.
199,Monica, That’s not your regular dry cleaners.
200,Phoebe," I know, but that creep that I went on that date with goes to there so I
have to find a new one. I also have to find a new video store, a new bank, a new adult
bookstore, a new grocery store…"
201,Monica, What?!
202,Phoebe," A new grocery store. The universe said I was going to meet a nice guy
and that’s what they gave me? (Looks up) When I get up there I’m going to kick
some ass."
203,Monica," Don’t worry Phoebe, you’re gonna meet someone. If I can meet a
great guy, so can you."
204,Phoebe," Yeah, we both can. And we both will."
206,Phoebe," Oh, you didn’t have to come in with me."
207,Monica," Are you kidding? This is where they get out stains! Okay? This is like Disneyland
for me. I’m-I’m gonna be over here watching the dance of the clean shirts. (She
points to and walks over to the electric clothes rack they have.)"
208,Phoebe, Okay.
211,Phoebe, What?
213,Phoebe," Oh yeah well, I’m sorry about that too, but what are you going to
do?"
215,Phoebe," A little. (She turns around and looks up.) (To the universe) Now
you’re talking."
217,Phoebe, I-I-I’d love to. Let me just tell my friend.
218,Monica," (to the clerk) Ooh, an ink stain! Hey, can I watch how you get this out?"
219,Phoebe, (looking around) She must’ve left.
221,Rachel, Hi.
222,Joey, So? What-what-what happened?
223,Rachel," It’s all gonna be okay. They’re just so happy that I’m
not suing them that they gave me one extra month paid maternity leave. So long as I
understand that the money should not construed as a down payment on this or any other
child I should bear."
224,Chandler," Wow, Ralph Lauren is really going out of there way to show
they’re not in the baby buying business."
225,Rachel," Chandler, can you give us a minute?"
226,Chandler," Oh I’m sorry, you’re kicking me out of my own living room?"
227,Rachel, Yeah.
228,Chandler, I’ll be in there. (Goes into the bedroom.)
229,Rachel," Joey, I’m really sorry that I lied to you. I was just trying to
make things…"
230,Joey, I know. I know.
231,Rachel," It kinda worked. I mean y’know, I don’t know about you buy I
haven’t thought about our thing since all this."
232,Joey," Hey you’re right. Yeah, it’s kinda been like us again a little
bit."
233,Rachel, Yeah I know! I miss that.
234,Joey," Me too. I mean I…haven’t thought at all about how I put myself
out there and said all that stuff and how you didn’t feel the same way about me
and-and how it was really awkward."
236,Rachel, My gynecologist tried to kill me.
239,Ross," (on phone) Item J437-A, color winterberry. (There’s a knock on the
door as he hangs up the phone. He answers it to Mona.) Hi umm, listen come here, come in.
(She does so.) I’m so-so sorry about yesterday. I-I’m really sorry. It’s
just that I… (He picks up the pink shirt.)"
241,Ross, You do?
243,Ross, (faking starting to cry) Oh God you’re right.
245,Ross, (laughs) No. (Takes the shirt back.)
0,Phoebe," Oh, Ross, Mon, is it okay if I bring someone to your parent’s
anniversary party?"
1,Monica, Yeah.
2,Ross, Sure. Yeah.
3,Joey," So, who’s the guy?"
4,Phoebe," Well, his name is Parker and I met him at the drycleaners."
5,Chandler," Oooh, did he put a little starch in your bloomers? (Sits up) Who said
that?"
6,Phoebe," Yeah, he’s really great though. He has this incredible zest for
life, and he treats me like a queen, except at night when he treats me like the naughty
girl I am."
7,Monica," (To Ross) Oh, by the way. Would it be okay if I gave the toast to mom
and dad this year?"
8,Ross," Uh, yeah, you sure you want to after what happened at their 20th?"
9,Monica," Yeah, I’d really like to."
10,Ross," Okay, hopefully this time mom won’t boo you."
11,Monica," Yes! Every year Ross makes the toast, and it’s always really
moving, and always makes them cry. Well this year I’m going to make them cry."
12,Chandler, And you wonder why Ross is their favorite?
13,Monica," No! Really! Any time Ross makes a toast everyone cries, and hugs him,
and pats him on the back and they all come up to me and say, ""God, your
brother."" Know what they’ll say this year? ""God, you"""
14,Joey," Well I can promise you, at least one person will be crying. (Points to
himself) I’m an actor, and any actor worth himself can cry on cue. (snaps fingers)"
15,Monica, Really you can do that?
16,Joey," Are you kidding me? Watch! (Makes funny faces trying to cry) Well I
can’t do it with you guys watching me!"
19,Chandler, What are you doing?
20,Monica," Oh I’m working on my toast for the party, or as I like to call it.
Sob fest 2002. Hey check this out. (Hands him a picture.)"
21,Chandler, It’s a dog.
22,Monica," It’s a dead dog. That’s Chi-Chi; she died when I was in high
school."
23,Chandler," It’s your parents’ anniversary and you’re going to talk
about their dead pet?"
24,Monica," The good stuff, huh?"
26,Rachel, Hi!
27,Ross, Hey!
28,Joey, Hey!
29,Monica, You got a present for my parents. That’s so sweet.
30,Joey," Yeah, yeah, in honor of their 35th wedding anniversary, I had a
star named after them. "
31,Ross, Aww that is so cool.
32,Joey, And I got them a book on Karma Sutra for the elderly.
33,Rachel," Hey, do you guys have any extra ribbon?"
34,Chandler," Yeah, sure. What do you need? We got lace, satin, sateen, raffia,
gingham, felt, (Pause) and I think my testacles may be in here too."
35,Ross," (picking up Chi-Chi’s picture) Aww! Chi-Chi! Oh, I loved this dog!
Y’know Monica couldn’t get braces because Chi-Chi needed knee surgery."
36,Monica, What?!
37,Ross, You were the 200-pound 11-year-old who rode her!
39,Phoebe, Hey!
41,Phoebe," Everybody, this is Parker, Parker this is…"
43,Chandler, Ha!
45,Ross," Ah, actually, I’m sorry we-we probably should get going."
47,Rachel," I, uh, think you already are."
49,Monica, That’s my old dog. He passed away years ago.
51,Monica, It’s out on the island. It’s in Massapequa. 
53,Ross," Well, there is an Arby’s in the shape of a tee-pee."
54,Monica," Okay, I got my note cards. (To Chandler) Do you got the presents? "
55,Chandler, Yeah.
56,Monica, And I’ve got the car keys.
58,Monica, Yeah.
61,Ross," So uh, he seems like a nice guy."
62,Rachel," Yeah, yeah I like him a lot."
63,Ross, Ya wanna hang back and take our own cab?
64,Rachel," Yeah, otherwise I’m not going."
67,Ross, Hi! (Kisses his mom.) Hey mom.
68,Rachel," This is such a great party! 35 years. Very impressive, do you guys have
any pearls of wisdom? "
71,Ross," That’s a good question, dad. That’s a good question…"
72,Rachel, Hmmm….
74,Rachel, Thank you…we’re so excited
76,Ross, Wha—What?
80,Ross, Dad so what we have to pretend that we’re married?
82,Ross, Can you believe that?
83,Rachel," Yeah, if you’re going to do the ears, you might as well take a pass
at the nosal area."
84,Ross," No, us having to lie about being married."
85,Rachel," No, I know I don’t either, but ya know what, it’s their party,
and it’s just one night. And we don’t even have to lie; we just won’t say
anything. If it comes up again, we’ll just…smile. We’ll nod along."
88,Ross," Hi Aunt Lisa, Uncle Dan"
92,Rachel, Oh…
94,Rachel, (looking at the check) Unbelievable!
95,Ross, We love marriage!
98,Ross, Hey
99,Phoebe, Hey!
101,Chandler, I don’t think the flash went off.
103,Phoebe, I’ll go with you
105,Chandler," Somewhere there is someone with a tranquilizer gun and a huge
butterfly net looking for that man."
106,Joey," I have to go to the bathroom too, but I don’t want him complimenting
my thing."
107,Ross, I’m so we weren’t in the car! Did he ever let up?
108,Monica, He called the Long Island Expressway a concrete miracle.
109,Ross," (imitating Parker) This room! This night! That waiter! His shoes! I must
take a mental picture! (He backs into someone.) Ooh sorry…(He looks behind him then
notices its Phoebe then stops his impression.)"
110,Phoebe, Were you guys making fun of Parker?
111,Ross," That depends, how much did you hear?"
112,Phoebe," So, he a little enthusiastic, what’s wrong with that?"
113,Monica," It’s just that, it’s so much."
114,Phoebe," Well, so what I like him! Do I make fun of the people you’ve dated?
Tag, Janice, Mona? No, because friends don’t do that. But, do you want my opinion? Do
you want it? ‘Cause in my opinion, your collective dating record reads like the
who’s who of human crap. (Walks off)"
115,Monica, I feel terrible.
116,Joey, I know
117,Ross, What was wrong with Mona?
120,Rachel, Open it! Open it! Open it!
121,Ross, Yeah baby!
124,Ross," No, no, it was just our parents and 1 or 2 friends. It was a small
wedding."
125,Rachel," But it was beautiful. I mean it was small, but kind of spectacular."
127,Rachel," On a cliff, in Barbados, at sunset, and Stevie Wonder sang Isn’t
She Lovely as I walked down the aisle."
129,Rachel," Yeah, Stevie’s an old family friend. (Hits Ross’s chest)"
131,Rachel," So would I. You wouldn’t think that Annie Liebawitz would forget to
put film in the camera."
132,Ross," Would you excuse us for a second? (Pulls Rachel off to the side)
Umm…. what are you doing?"
133,Rachel," What? I’m not you. This may be the only wedding I ever have. I want
it to be amazing."
134,Ross," Okay, okay. Ooooh, ooh maybe I rode in on a Harley. "
135,Rachel," Okay, Ross, it has to be realistic."
138,Phoebe," No, I’m fine. I’m great. I’m with you."
140,Phoebe," Hm huh, yeah."
142,Phoebe," No, that’s not necessary."
144,Phoebe," No, actually I don’t eat…"
146,Phoebe," Okay, fine! Fine! (Takes the oyster and pretends to eat it while
dropping it on the floor) Mmm…hmmmmm…."
148,Phoebe, Why don’t you just try one?
151,Chandler, What are you doin’?
152,Monica," Just going over my toast. Those two will never know what hit ‘em. I
can’t wait. They’re going to be crying so hard. They’re going to be
fighting for breath. "
153,Chandler," Ya know if you want to, I can just hold them down and you could
(Punches the air)."
155,Rachel," And my veil was lace, made by blind, Belgium nuns."
157,Rachel," Well, not at first, but it was very intricate work and they said even
though they lost their sight, it was all worth it."
159,Rachel," Well, I don’t know about that, but some said that I looked like a
floating angel."
161,Rachel, Oh yeah. That’s a great story.
162,Ross," Well, um, actually, I-I took her to the planetarium.
That’s-that’s where we had our first date. Um, she walked in and I had the room
filled with lilies, her favorite flower…"
164,Rachel, Shhh! I want to hear the rest!
165,Ross," Then, Fred Astaire singing The Way You Look Tonight came on the
sound system, and the lights came down. And I got down on one knee and written across the
dome in the stars were the words ""Will you marry me?"""
167,Rachel," And the ring, was the size of my fist (makes a fist)!"
169,Joey," Yeah uh, Phoebe! Look umm, I want to apologize about before, okay? We were
being jerks. Parker’s a nice guy and I’d like to get to know him."
170,Phoebe, Then you better do it now.
171,Joey, Why?
172,Phoebe, Because I’m going to kill him
173,Joey, What-what? 
174,Phoebe," You guys were right. He’s just too excited about…everything. I
mean I’m all for living life, but this is the Geller’s 35th
anniversary. Okay? Let’s call a spade a spade this party stinks."
175,Joey," I know I’m having the worst time. There was a 15-minute line for the
buffet, and when I finally got up to the plates, I slipped on a giant booger!"
176,Phoebe, Are you sure it wasn’t an oyster?
177,Joey," I guess it could’ve been, I didn’t really look at it.
Y’know, I just wiped it on Chandler’s coat and got the hell out of there."
178,Phoebe, He’s just such a great guy I’m so excited about him.
179,Joey," Oh hey, you should be excited about him. There’s nothing wrong with
him he’s a good guy. "
180,Phoebe, You think?
181,Joey, Yeah. Ya know what I think; I think we were all just being too negative.
182,Phoebe," You’re right. You’re right, he’s just embracing life. We
could all stand to be a little more like Parker. You know what? I am like him! I’m a
sunny, positive person. "
183,Joey," Actually, you have a little bit of an edge."
184,Phoebe, What’s that now?
185,Joey, Nothing…
186,Phoebe, Oh look it’s Parker! 
188,Phoebe, Oooh I love it!
190,Phoebe, Are you kidding? People acting like animals to music. Come on!
192,Monica," Okay it’s time for the toast! Umm now-now, I know that Ross usually
gives the toast, but this year I’m going to do it."
194,Monica," No, no it’s going to be great. Really! Mom, Dad, when I got
married, one of the things that made me sure I could do it was the amazing example the two
of you set for me. For that and so many other things I want to say thank you. I know I
probably don’t say it enough, but I love you. (Pretends to cry hoping her parents
will join her.) When I look around this room, I’m-I’m saddened by the thought of
those who could not be here with us. Nana, my beloved grandmother who would so want to be
here, but she can’t because she’s dead. As is our dog Chi-Chi. I mean look how
cute she is. (Holds up the picture and pretends to cry again). Was. (To an old man by the
stage.) Do me a favor and pass this to my parents. Remember she’s dead. Okay, her and
Nana, gone. Wow! Hey does anybody remember when Debra Winger had to say goodbye to her
children in Terms of Endearment? (Chandler covers his ears) Didn’t see that?
No movie fans?! You want to hear something sad? The other day I was watching 60 Minutes
these orphans in Romania, who have been so neglected, they were incapable of love. (Waits
for people to cry, but doesn’t get any tears.) You people are made of stone!
Here’s to mom and dad! Whatever!"
198,Ross," Oh, no, Mom, it’s just Monica this year."
200,Ross," No, of course, Um… Um, everybody? Um, I-I just wanted to say…on
behalf of my new bride, Rachel (She turns around and smiles), and myself. Umm, that
if…if in 35 years, we’re half as happy as you guys are, we’ll count
ourselves the luckiest people in the world."
205,Phoebe, Can I get you something to drink? Like a water and Valium? 
207,Phoebe, Oh thank God. 
209,Phoebe," Yeah? I know! I know! Uh huh? Listen why don’t we just um, sit and
relax? You know just be with each other. Quietly! "
211,Phoebe," Let’s try something else, let’s play a game."
213,Phoebe," Shocking! Let’s play the game of who can stay quiet the longest.
(Giggles)"
215,Phoebe," But, let’s play this one first. And remember whoever talks first
loses! "
218,Phoebe, Oh my God! Oh my God! 
220,Phoebe," Wrong? Really? You know the word wrong. Everything isn’t perfect?
Everything isn’t magical? Everything isn’t a glow with the light of a million
fairies? They were just brake lights, Parker! "
222,Phoebe, You don’t have to put a good spin on everything.
224,Phoebe," No! I am a positive person. You are like Santa Clause on Prozac, at Disneyland,
getting laid! "
226,Phoebe, Much less happy!
228,Phoebe," So long! Don’t let the best door in the world hit you in the ass on
your way out! (He exits and she slams the door behind him.)"
231,Phoebe, Uh huh. (Closes door)
233,Ross," …and then, we could’ve gone from the ceremony to the reception
with you in the sidecar!"
234,Rachel," Ross, it just wouldn’t have been feasible."
235,Ross," But having a dove place the ring on your finger would’ve been no
problem?"
236,Rachel, It was really fun being married to you tonight. 
237,Ross," Yeah! And! And, it was the easiest 400 bucks I’ve ever made."
238,Rachel," Okay Ross, can I uh, can I ask you something?"
239,Ross, Yeah.
240,Rachel," That proposal, at the planetarium…"
241,Ross," I know, I know it was stupid. "
242,Rachel," Are you kidding?! With the, with the lilies, and-and the song, and the
stars! It was…really wonderful! Did you just make that up? "
243,Ross," No, actually I thought about it when, when we were going out. It’s
how I imagined I uh, I would ask you to marry me. "
244,Rachel," Well, that would’ve been very hard to say no too. "
245,Ross," It’s a good thing I didn’t do it, because it sounds like it
would’ve been a very expensive wedding. (Rachel laughs) Okay, good night"
246,Rachel, Goodnight
248,Ross," Even if the sidecar had a windscreen so your hair wouldn’t get messed
up? "
249,Rachel, I will think about it. 
250,Ross, That’s all I’m askin’ 
253,Monica," Okay that’s it. I give up. At mom and dad’s 40th
anniversary, you’re the one giving the speech. "
254,Ross," Y’know I don’t understand why they didn’t cry. It was a
beautiful speech. "
255,Monica," Oh, come on. "
256,Ross," Hey! All that stuff you said about true love, you were right, I mean, we
did learn a lot from Mom and Dad! And that picture of Chi-Chi with her mischievous grin.
And what you said about Nana. Ohh, yeah she really would’ve wanted to be there. And
you know what? I think she was. "
257,Monica," (starts to cry) Oh good God, Ross! How the hell do you do it? "
0,Rachel, Hi!
1,Ross, Hey!
2,Monica, Hey!
3,Rachel," So, I’m in my apartment doing the Soap Opera Digest
crossword puzzle, and guess who the clue is for three down. (She hands the magazine to
Joey.)"
4,Joey," (reading) Three down, Days Of Our Lives star blank Tribbiani.
That’s me!! I’m blank!!"
5,Monica," How cool is this?! We know three down! I’m touching three down!
(She has her hand on his shoulder.)"
6,Joey, Yeah you are baby.
7,Monica," Three down knows I’m married, what’s three down doin’?"
8,Rachel, So did they call you to tell you your name’s gonna be in this?
9,Joey," No. They really like me over there. They want to do a big profile on me,
but I said no."
10,Ross, Why’d you say no?
11,Joey," Remember what happened the last time I did an interview for them? I said I
write a lot of my own lines, and then the writers got mad and made my character fall down
the elevator shaft. So who knows what I might say this time."
12,Chandler," If only there was something in your head to control the things
you say. (Joey nods his agreement.)"
13,Rachel," Oh, come on Joey! You will totally keep it in check this time, and plus
y’know the publicity would be really good for your career! And you deserve that! And
if you do the interview you can mention, oh I don’t know, gal pal Rachel Green?"
14,Chandler, Is that gal pal spelled L-O-S-E-R?
15,Rachel," Okay, don’t listen to him. Please?"
16,Joey," Fine! All right, I’ll do it. But hey! You guys have to be at the next
table so you can stop me if I y’know, start to say something stupid."
17,Ross," Just then or-or all the time, ‘cause we-we have jobs y’know."
18,Rachel," Come on! We will be there for you the whole time! Just remember gal pal
Rachel Green. (Excited) Ha-ha! I’m gonna be in Soap Opera Digest! And not just
in the dumb crossword puzzle. (Looks at Joey.) Seriously, proud of you."
19,Joey, Yeah.
23,Joey," Oh, not at all. Happy to do it."
25,Monica, (To Chandler) You think we’re being obvious?
26,Chandler," No, we’re just four people with neck problems. You talk like
this. (Out of the sides of their mouths.)"
29,Joey," (laughs) Actually, I didn’t know the magazine was paying for it.
Wouldn’t have mattered, I’m doing this for the fans, not for the free food."
32,Joey, And I’ll have all the muffins.
34,Phoebe, (entering) Hey!
35,Ross, Shhh! We’re not talking.
36,Phoebe, Oh. Finally! Oh. (Sits back in relief.)
40,Joey,
44,Joey,
48,Joey,
52,Joey,
55,Joey,
56,Chandler,
57,Joey,
59,Joey," Well, there are so many things, it’s hard to pick just one."
61,Phoebe," I’m gonna get some coffee, anyone want anything?"
62,Rachel," Oh yeah, I’d actually love a blueberry muffin and a chamomile tea."
63,Ross," Uh, double latte, extra foam."
64,Chandler, And a bagel with only…
65,Phoebe, (interrupting him) I was just being polite!
69,Joey,
70,Rachel,
71,Joey,
73,Chandler,
74,Phoebe,
76,Joey,
79,Chandler,
80,Ross,

95,Joey,
97,Chandler,
98,Joey,
100,Chandler,
101,Joey,
102,Chandler,
104,Joey," In my spare time I uh, read to the blind. And I’m also a mento for
the kids.(The gang shake their heads.) Y’know a mento, a role model. (Chandler bites
his fist to keep from talking.)"
106,Joey, Right.
108,Joey," Matter of fact, I do."
111,Joey," Uh, we stars just try to eat right and get lots of exercise."
113,Joey,
114,Ross,
115,Joey,
116,Ross,
117,Joey, Yeah!
118,Ross, Hey! We totally forgot about lunch!
119,Joey,
122,Chandler,
123,Joey,
124,Chandler,
125,Joey,
127,Rachel,
129,Ross,

136,Chandler,
137,Joey,
140,Rachel,
141,Chandler,
142,Rachel,
144,Joey,
146,Joey," Uhh, I don’t believe in these crazy diets y’know, just
everything in moderation."
148,Joey, I’ll take those to go. (To the interviewer) For the kids.
150,Joey," It was so stupid, I said some stuff in an interview that I shouldn’t
have said. But believe me, that’s not gonna happen today."
152,Joey," Well, I said that I… (The gang jumps up and interrupts him.)"
155,Joey," You guys, this is Shelley, she’s interviewing me for Soap Opera
Digest, and Shelley, this are my friends…"
156,Rachel," (interrupting him) Hi! I’m gal pal Rachel Green, and if you want
the dirt, I’m the one you come too. This might be Joey’s baby (rubbing her
stomach), who knows? I’m just kidding—Seriously, (leans into the cassette
recorder Shelley is using) gal pal Rachel Green."
157,Ross," (leaning into the recorder as well) Who just lost the respect of her
unborn child."
159,Joey, Okay.
160,Monica, Joey! You’re doing great!
161,Ross," Yeah, so far nothing stupid."
162,Chandler, Mento?
163,Joey, No thanks.
165,Ross," Uh no, no just-just that he is a great guy."
166,Rachel," (scoffs at him) Yeah, that’s gonna get you into Soap Opera
Digest. Well I…(leans into the microphone again)…I would just like to say
that Joey truly has enriched the days of our lives."
167,Phoebe," Umm, I…I just think you don’t expect someone so hot to be so
sweet."
169,Phoebe," Umm, Phoebe Buffay."
171,Phoebe," Oh okay, it’s P as in Phoebe, H as in hoebe, O as in oebe, E as in
ebe, B as in bee-bee and E as in (In an Australian accent) ‘Ello there mate!"
173,Ross," Yeah, you too."
174,Rachel, You too!
175,Chandler, Thanks.
176,Monica, Bye. (They resume their previous positions.)
179,Joey," How come you have two?

Chandler Well this one's for you.

Joey Get out.

Chandler No, I can't. No-no, listen, I, I know how much this means to you and I
also know that this is about more than just jewelry, (Puts bracelet on Joey) it's about
you and me and the fact that we're (Reading bracelet) best buds.

Joey Wow, is this friendship? I think so. Check it out, we're bracelet buddies.

Chandler That's what they'll call us.

[The next one is from Episode 618 The One Where Ross Dates A Student.]"
181,Rachel," Oh, Joey! Sorry!"
182,Joey, No that’s all right. Don’t worry about it.
183,Rachel, Oh but look! That’s gonna leave a stain! 
184,Joey, Rach! Hey! It’s fine! You’re at Joey’s!
185,Rachel, Really?
186,Joey, Yeah! Look! (He throws some of his spaghetti on the floor.)
187,Rachel, I’ve never lived like this before.
188,Joey, I know.
190,Joey," All right, don’t waste it, I mean its still food. (He picks it up and
eats it.)"
193,Ross," All right I've been feeling incredibly guilty about this, because I wanna
be a good friend, and damnit I am a good friend. So just, just shut up and close your eyes
(kisses Joey)."
194,Joey," Wow, you are a good friend, 'course the audition was this morning, and I
didn't get it. But that was a hell of a kiss. Rachel is a very lucky girl."
196,Joey,
197,Phoebe,
198,Joey,
199,Phoebe,
200,Joey,
201,Phoebe,
202,Joey,
203,Phoebe,
204,Joey,
206,Joey,
207,Ross,
209,Monica,
211,Joey,
213,Joey," Umm, no. No best friend, no. Just a lot of close friends."
215,Joey, Really? Me? Wow! I don’t even know any huge gay people!
217,Chandler, It hurts me. It physically hurts me.
221,Joey," What? Are you referring to my man's bag? At first, I thought it just
looked good, but it's practical too. Check it out! It's got compartments for all your
stuff! Your wallet! Your keys! Your address book!"
222,Ross, Your make-up!
224,Ross," Okay. Now-now-now should I climb down your front so we’re face to
face or-or should I climb down your back so we’re-we’re butt to face."
225,Joey, I think face to face.
226,Ross, I would say that.
227,Joey," Face to face, yeah!"
228,Ross," Okay, here I go."
229,Joey, All right. 
231,Joey, (grunting) Oh my… How much do you weigh Ross?!
232,Ross," I prefer not to answer that right now, I’m still carrying a little
holiday weight."
234,Joey," Y’know, when we talked about face to face, I don’t think we
thought it all the way through."
237,Joey,
238,Phoebe,
239,Joey,
240,Phoebe,
242,Chandler,
243,Joey,
244,Chandler,
245,Joey,
248,Joey, Great nap.
249,Ross, It really was.
252,Joey," Uh me? Gay? No! No. No, but I have a number of close friends who are.
(Chandler and Ross look at each other.)"
255,Joey," Oh-oh-oh-oh, how I do it is, I look a woman up and down and say,
""Hey, how you doin’?"""
256,Phoebe," Oh, please!"
257,Joey," (to Phoebe) Hey, how you doin’?"
261,Joey, Hey! How you doin’?
263,Joey," I’d love to show ya, but I just tucked her in. She’s sleeping.
(The women both laugh) Hey uh, would you two girls like to go for a drink? (Just then the
same guy with the football dives to make a catch, lands on the car cover, and collapses
it. It turns out that Joey set up a bunch of boxes to make it look like a Porsche.)"
266,Rachel," Oh my God, Jill!"
269,Chandler," Oh my God, introduce us!"
270,Rachel, This is Chandler. (Points at him.)
272,Rachel, And you know Monica and Ross!
273,Ross, Hi Jill.
274,Rachel," And that’s Phoebe (points), and that’s Joey."
275,Joey," Hey, (in the Joey voice) how you doin’?"
276,Rachel, Don’t!! (Joey backs away frightened.)
279,Joey," Oh! I see what happened. It's because I was trying to repel you. Right?
Believe me, you'd feel a lot different if I turned it on."
281,Joey," Oh, I do. (Gives her the Joey-love look.) How you doin?"
283,Joey, What?!?! Oh dear God!
285,Joey, Not much to tell there I’m really shy.
288,Joey, Oh great! Great! Thank you. (They shake hands.)
290,Joey," Bye-bye. (The interviewer leaves and he sits down with the rest of the
gang.) I did it!"
291,Rachel, Yeah!
292,Ross, Amazing! Amazing!
294,Joey," Oh, I don’t watch soap operas. Excuse me, I have a life, y’know?"
297,Joey," Oh, good to know. (The interviewer leaves.) So close!"
300,Rachel," Wow! I can’t believe they didn’t put it in the part where you
said you didn’t watch soap operas."
301,Joey," Yeah, I called the lady about that. I told her I was just joking. She was
pretty nice about that."
302,Monica, You slept with her didn’t you?
303,Joey," Little bit, yeah."
304,Ross, Wow! This picture of you sure is steamy.
305,Joey," Oh yeah, that’s just a little something for my huge gay fan base.
(Winks at him.)"
306,Ross, Did you just wink at me?
307,Joey," Hey, you’re the one that loves the picture."
0,Rachel, (entering) Hi!
1,Monica, Hey!
2,Phoebe, Hey!
3,Rachel, So what’s the final head count on my baby shower?
4,Phoebe," About twenty, a couple people from work who had something else to do. "
5,Monica, Also both of your sisters called and neither can make it.
6,Rachel," What?! You mean they’re not coming to a social event where
there’s no men and there’s no booze?! That’s shocking! I don’t care,
as long as my mom’s here."
7,Monica," Oh my God, your mother!"
8,Rachel, What?! My mom’s not gonna be here?!
9,Monica," Well, given that we forgot to invite her it would be an awfully big
coincidence if she was."
10,Rachel, My God!
11,Monica," Well it wasn’t my fault, Phoebe was in charge of the invitations!"
12,Phoebe," Well I don’t, I don’t have a mother so often I forget that
other people…"
13,Monica, (interrupting her) Oh give it a rest!
14,Rachel, So my mother is not coming to my baby shower?!
15,Phoebe, No. (Pause) Neither is mine.
16,Monica," Okay, y’know what? Don’t worry, okay? We’ll take care of
it. We’ll call her. Just go home and get ready."
17,Rachel," Please, make sure she comes. It’s really important to me, I mean
it’s my mom!"
18,Phoebe," I know. I know, what’s her number?"
19,Rachel, I don’t know.
20,Monica," Go! I have it in my book. Go! (Rachel leaves and Monica calls Mrs.
Green.) (To Phoebe) Wait a minute! If you’re in charge of the invitations why am I
the one who has to call her—Hello Mrs. Green! Hi, it’s Monica Geller."
22,Monica," (on phone) Hi, umm I know this is last minute, but we’ve decided to
throw an impromptu baby shower for Rachel today."
24,Monica," Yeah, I’m sorry. I’m-I’m so sorry."
26,Monica," (To Phoebe) Oh my God, my ass is sweating! (on phone) Please! Please!
Can you come? It’s today at four."
28,Monica, Thank you. (Hangs up.)
29,Phoebe, Isn’t it at three?
30,Monica, Son of a bitch! (Calls Mrs. Green again.)
33,Chandler, Hey Joe! You wanna shoot some hoops?
34,Joey," Oh no, I can’t go. I’m practicing; I got an audition to be the
host of a new game show."
35,Ross, Oh cool!
36,Chandler, That’s great.
37,Joey," Yeah-yeah, and if I get it by day I’ll (In a sexy voice) Dr. Drake
Remoray, but by night I’ll be (In an announcer’s voice) Joey Trrrribbiani!"
38,Chandler, You’ll be perfect for this! That’s already your name!
39,Joey," But the audition’s in a couple hours and I don’t even understand
the game."
40,Ross, Well do you want some help?
41,Joey, Oh really? That’d be great! You guys can be the contestants!
42,Ross, Awesome!
43,Chandler," Okay, I guess we can lose to junior high girls some other time."
44,Joey, (announcer voice) All right! Let’s play Bamboozled!
45,Chandler, Bamboozled?
46,Joey," Yeah, isn’t that a cool name?"
47,Ross, (simultaneously with Chandler) Yeah!
48,Chandler, (simultaneously with Ross) No!
49,Joey," All right. Uhh, okay. Our first contestant is Ross Geller. Why don’t
you tell us a little something about you Ross?"
50,Ross," Well uh, I-I’m a paleontologist. Umm, I-I live in New York. I have a
son Ben. Uh, hi Ben! (Waves.) And uh…"
51,Joey," I said a little bit Ross. Now, how about you Chandler?"
52,Chandler," Well Joey, I’m a headhunter. I hook up out of work Soviet
scientists with rogue third-world nations. Hi Rasputin! (Waves.)"
53,Joey," Excellent! Let’s play Bamboozled! Chandler, you’ll go first.
What is the capital of Columbia?"
54,Chandler, Bogota.
55,Joey," It’s Ba-go-ta, but close enough. Now, you can either pass your turn
to Ross or pick a Wicked Wango card."
56,Chandler, What does a Wicked Wango card do?
57,Joey," I should know that. Let’s see, just one moment please. Umm, here we
are, a Wicked Wango card determines whether you go higher or lower."
58,Chandler, Higher or lower than what?
59,Joey, This is embarrassing. (Looks it up.)
60,Chandler, (To Ross) Can you believe how lame this is?
61,Ross," I’m sorry, I don’t believe contestants are allowed to talk to
each other."
63,Phoebe," Oh, I told the stripper to be here at five. That’s good right?"
64,Monica, You ordered a stripper for the shower?! That is totally inappropriate!
65,Phoebe," What? He’s gonna be dressed as a baby! (Mrs. Green enters.) Oh hi
Mrs. Green!"
66,Monica, Hi!
67,Phoebe, I’m so glad you could make it.
68,Monica," Yes, thank you so much. And again, we’re so sorry. We could not
feel worse about it."
70,Monica, She’s still mad.
71,Phoebe," Yeah I know. Isn’t it great? One less person we have to make small
talk with."
72,Monica," Phoebe, Sandra’s mad at you too. It-it doesn’t bother you?"
73,Phoebe," No look, we’ve apologized twice! I can’t do anymore than that.
I know you hate it when people are mad at you but you just have to be okay with it."
74,Monica, Okay. I can do that. (Pause) I gotta go powder my ass.
77,Rachel, Okay. (Mrs. Green helps her up and they walk over and get some tea.)
79,Rachel," Oh well actually gonna use a nanny and uh, I don’t even have a
housekeeper."
81,Rachel," Mrs. Kay! Oh yeah, she was sweet. She taught me Spanish. I actually
think I remember some of it, tu madre es loca. (I think that’s your mother’s
crazy.)"
83,Rachel," Well, however great she was I just can’t afford that."
85,Rachel, What?
87,Rachel, Wh-wh-what? What?
89,Rachel, Yes. Yes I do.
91,Joey," All right Ross you’re in the lead, would you like to take another
question or spin the Wheel of Mayhem?"
92,Ross," The wheel has not been my friend tonight Joey. Uh, I’ll take another
question. "
93,Joey," Okay, this is gonna be tough. Hold your breath."
94,Ross," It’s okay, I’m ready."
95,Joey," No dude, you gotta hold your breath until you’re ready to answer the
question."
96,Chandler," This is ridiculous, he’s not gonna hold his breath… (Ross
cuts him off by taking a deep breath and holding it.)"
97,Joey," Okay, what do you have a fear of if you suffer from this phobia,
Tris…Holy cow, that’s a big word. Trisc… Seriously look at this thing.
Chandler, how do you say that?"
98,Chandler, Let me see that.
99,Joey, This one right here. (Ross whines.)
100,Chandler, Triscadecaphobia.
101,Ross, (exhaling) The fear of Triscuts! 
102,Joey," No! No, fear of the number 13."
103,Chandler, Fear of Triscuts?
104,Ross," It’s possible, they have really sharp edges."
105,Joey," All right Chandler, you’re up."
106,Ross," Wait a minute, I-I believe I’m entitled to use my Angel Pass for a
free turn?"
107,Chandler, This game makes no sense!
108,Ross, Y’know what? You’re just upset because you’re losing.
109,Chandler," Oh come on Ross, I think we’re all losers here."
110,Joey," All right. Chandler, you can either spin the wheel or pick a Google card."
111,Chandler, Let me think. Let me think—Oh! I don’t care.
112,Joey, You-you must choose Mr. Bing.
113,Chandler," Either, it makes no difference."
114,Joey," Choose, you jackass!"
115,Chandler, I’ll take a card.
116,Joey," Okay, you picked the Gimmie card! You get all of Ross’s points!"
117,Ross, What?!
118,Chandler, This game is kinda fun.
119,Ross," (To Chandler) You don’t think it’s a little crazy that you get
all my points just ‘cause you…"
120,Chandler," I don’t think the contestants are supposed to speak to each
other."
122,Rachel, Why did you invite my mother?!
123,Monica, What?
124,Rachel, She wants to move in with me and Ross to help take care of the baby.
125,Phoebe, For how long?
126,Rachel," Eight weeks. I mean I love my mother, but my God, a long lunch with her
is taxing."
127,Monica, I personally would be honored if she wanted to live with me.
128,Phoebe, She can’t hear you.
129,Rachel," What? You guys, come on! What am I going to do?"
130,Phoebe," Well, if you don’t want your mother to move in with you, just tell
her."
131,Rachel," You’re right. You’re right. I mean I’m about to have a
baby, I can tell my mother that I don’t want her to just be sleeping on my couch! Oh
my God! She’s gonna want to sleep in my bed with me. This cannot happen!"
132,Monica," That’s right. That is right, you go over there and tell her you
don’t want her to live with you. Do not take no for an answer!"
133,Rachel, Okay. (She goes over to tell her mother.)
134,Monica," (To Phoebe) This is great! Now she’s gonna be mad at Rachel!
Y’know what? And I’m just gonna swoop in there and be like the daughter she
never had."
135,Phoebe," I have new respect for Chandler. All right everybody! It’s time to
open the presents!"
136,Monica," Yes! Yes! And I think that the first gift that Rachel opens
should be from the grandmother of the baby, because you’re the most important person
in this room. And in the world!"
138,Phoebe," How about you less important people, let’s open your presents!"
140,Rachel, Mom that’s okay that you didn’t get you a gift!
142,Rachel," Oh yeah. Okay, see mom, the truth is I can do this on my own."
144,Rachel," But mom, I really know what I’m doing. I can handle this."
146,Rachel, He was a hamster! I am not going to vacuum up my baby!
147,Phoebe," Okay, come on Rach it’s present time! Y’know you’re the
glue that’s holding this whole party together. It’s kinda falling apart here."
149,Rachel, Wow!
150,Phoebe," Okay, this is from your friend at work."
151,Rachel," Oh my gosh! Oh wow! Oh, I know what this is! (She’s holding an item
with a large suction cup connected to a yellow plastic box, with a long narrow tube and
bottle connected the yellow part.) Wait a minute. That can’t be right. Is that a beer
bong for a baby?"
153,Rachel," Did I say I was done guessing? Okay, thank you for that. Oh wow!
What’s this?"
155,Rachel," Oh, it dispenses clean diapers!"
157,Rachel," Well that’s gross, why don’t you just take it outside and
throw it in a dumpster?"
159,Rachel," What?! It goes ten times a day! What are we feeding this baby?! Indian
food?!"
161,Monica," Rachel, listen to your mother. She is very smart."
163,Rachel," I don’t know, I’d leave it on the changing table? (Everyone
gasps.) What?! What’d I do? What’d I do?!"
165,Rachel," Oh come—(Stutters)—Of course I know that. I mean of course you
never leave a baby alone! I mean who would—she wouldn’t be safe as she would be
with me, the baby dummy. Oh God, okay. Y’know what? I think opening the presents
right now is a little overwhelming right now. So I think umm, I’m just gonna maybe
open them a little bit later, but thank you all for coming. And for these beautiful gifts,
and this basket is beautiful."
167,Rachel," Okay mommy, don’t ever leave me. (Hugs her.)"
170,Joey," (To Chandler) In what John Houston film would you hear this line,
""Badges? We don’t need no stinkin’ badges!"""
171,Chandler, Treasure of the Sierra Madre!
172,Joey, Correct! There’s a possible backwards bonus!
173,Chandler, Madre Sierra the of Treasure!
174,Joey, Yes!
175,Chandler," I’d like to go up the ladder of chance to the golden mud hut
please."
176,Joey," Wise choice, how many rungs?"
177,Chandler, Six!
178,Joey, (makes a sound like a monkey) That noise can only me one thing.
179,Chandler, (disappointed and simultaneously as Ross) Hungry monkey.
180,Ross," (excited and simultaneously as Chandler) Hungry monkey! (To Chandler)
Haaa! (To Joey) I’d like a Wicked Wango card!"
181,Joey," Okay, it’s an audio question, name this television theme song.
(Starts humming the theme to I Dream of Genie.)"
182,Ross," (thinking) Oh. (Pause) Oh! Oh my God! Okay, I know this, give me-give me a
second!"
183,Chandler, Tell it to the Time Turtle!
184,Ross, Shut up! I Dream of Genie!
185,Joey," Yes! Yes, you’re back in the lead!"
186,Ross, I’d like to spin the wheel!
188,Chandler, (annoyed) Oh come on!!
189,Joey," All right! All right! Uh, umm, Super-Speedy Speed round!"
190,Ross, Is there a hopping bonus?
191,Joey, Of course!
193,Joey, Who invented bifocals? 
194,Ross, Ben Franklin.
195,Joey, Correct! Which monarch has ruled Great Britain the longest?
196,Ross, Queen Victoria.
197,Joey," Correct again! But, you forgot to switch legs between questions, so no
hopping bonus!"
198,Ross, Noooo!!! Every time!!!
199,Joey," Now, over to Chandler."
200,Chandler, I’d like a Google Card.
201,Joey, Are you sure?
202,Chandler, Yes! (Pause) No! (Pause) Google!
203,Joey," Oh my God! Congratulations Ross, because Chandler, you’ve been
Bamboozled!"
204,Chandler, Nooo!!
205,Ross, Yeah!!
206,Chandler, This is the best game ever!!!
208,Rachel," So umm, you’re gonna stay with me as long as I need you?"
210,Rachel," Oh mom, I swear I’m not an idiot. I’ve read all kinds of books
on pregnancy and giving birth, but I-I just didn’t think to read the part about what
to do when the baby comes. And-and then guess what? The baby’s coming and I
don’t know what to do. Oh, can I throw up in my diaper genie?"
212,Rachel, Wait-wait where are you going? Where are you going?
214,Rachel, Okay.
216,Monica," It is going to be okay! (Mrs. Green glances over her shoulder and
glares at Monica while she heads for the bathroom.) It was worth a shot."
217,Ross," (entering, out of breath) Hey!"
218,Phoebe, Hey! Why are you all red and sweaty?
219,Ross," I just Bamboozled Chandler! (Flexes in victory while everyone stares at
him.) Which is not uh sexual thing. That was a quick shower."
220,Phoebe, Not if you were here.
221,Ross, Wow! It looks like we got a lot of good stuff.
222,Rachel," Oh we did, but my mom got us the greatest gift of all."
223,Ross, (excited) A Play-Dough Barber Shop?
224,Rachel, No. She’s going to live with us for eight weeks.
225,Ross," Uh, what?"
226,Rachel," Yes! She’s gonna help us take care of the baby! Woo-hoo. (Sees that
Ross isn’t happy.)"
227,Ross," What—You’re not serious. I mean she’s a very nice woman,
but there is no way we can take eight weeks of her. She’ll drive us totally crazy."
229,Ross, Hi roomie! (Hugs her and looks at Rachel.)
232,Joey, (announcer voice) It’s a pleasure to meet you Ray.
234,Joey, (announcer voice) Rightie-O Ray!
236,Joey," (to the camera) Hello, I’m Joey Tribbiani! Let’s play
Bamboozled! Erin, you get the first question! In hockey, who is known as The Great One?"
238,Joey," Correct! Now, would you like to pick a Wicked Wango card or spin the Wheel
of Mayhem?"
240,Joey, What—Why?!
242,Joey," Well what’s complicated? You spin the Wheel of Mayhem to go up the
Ladder of Chance. You go past the Mud Hut through the Rainbow Ring to get to the Golden
Monkey; you yank his tail and boom! You’re in Paradise Pond!"
244,Joey," Well what’s fun about that? You expect me to be the host of a boring
game that’s just people standing around answering questions?"
246,Joey, (announcer voice to the camera) Let’s play Bamboozled!
249,Ross, Well we…we don’t have a garage.
251,Ross," Y’know what? Maybe, Mrs. Green, it’s not absolutely vital that
you live with us."
253,Rachel, I do. I really do. I don’t know anything.
254,Ross, I’m-I’m sure that’s not true.
255,Rachel, Oh no? Pheebs? Monica? Do I know anything about babies?
256,Phoebe," No, not a thing."
257,Monica, It’s frightening.
258,Ross," Well uh, y’know what? Even if she doesn’t know anything, I do! I
have a son. And his mother and I didn’t live together, and whenever he was with me I
took care of him all the time, by myself."
260,Ross, Yeah.
262,Ross," That’s a different issue. Uh, the point is, when the baby comes I
will be there to…to feed her and bathe her and change her. And more than that I want
to do all those things."
264,Ross," Yes! Yes, you’re gonna be so missed."
266,Ross, Well you’re gonna be a wonderful grandma. (They hug.)
267,Rachel, Hello?! I still don’t know what the hell I’m doing!
268,Ross," Oh, come on, every first time mother feels that way.
You’ll—you’re gonna pick it up. (Rachel doesn’t believe that.) Hey!
You will! Uh look, y’know when you first came to the city? You were this spoiled
helpless little girl who-who still used daddy’s credit card. Do you remember?"
269,Rachel, I hope you’re going somewhere with this.
270,Ross," Look at you! What—You’re-you’re this big executive! You are
much more capable than you give yourself credit for. I-I have no doubt you’re gonna
be an incredible mother. "
271,Rachel, Really?
272,Ross, I’m telling you.
273,Rachel, Thank you. (Hugs him.)
275,Ross, Oh. (Rachel and he start to stand up.)
277,Monica," (laughs) You’re still so funny. You’re so funny. (To Phoebe)
What do I do?"
278,Phoebe," Nothing! You have apologized to her like a million times and she’s
been nothing but terrible to you. And don’t forget you just threw her daughter
a lovely, albeit slightly boring, shower, and she hasn’t even thanked you for
it."
279,Monica, Y’know what? You’re-you’re right.
280,Phoebe," Yeah I mean if you want to say anything to her, I’d tell her off."
281,Monica, Really?
282,Phoebe, Uh-huh!
283,Monica," Okay! I will! Mrs. Green? Mrs. Green! (She ignores Monica and Monica
follows her out into the hall with Phoebe in tow.) It is rude to leave a party without
saying good-bye to the host! Yeah, and-and also when someone apologizes to you the decent
thing to do is to accept it! Now what I did to you, it wasn’t on purpose! But what
you’re during to me now is just plain spiteful!"
285,Monica," That’s right! Maybe it’s time you took a good hard look at a
mirror young lady…old lady…lady!"
286,Phoebe," (To Monica) Wrap it up, wrap it up, wrap it up…"
287,Monica," So whenever you’re ready to apologize to me, I will forgive you.
Good day! (Monica and Phoebe reenter the apartment and Monica closes the door on a stunned
Mrs. Green.) I can’t feel my legs!"
288,Phoebe, You were fantastic! I’m so proud of you!
289,Monica, Yeah? I’m proud of me too.
290,Phoebe, You should be!
291,Monica, Yeah could-could-could you get me something to drink?
292,Phoebe, You got it!
293,Monica," Okay. (When Phoebe turns around Monica runs out into the hall after Mrs.
Green.) Mrs. Green! Okay I’m really sorry!! I’m apologizing for the—(She
trips and falls down the stairs.) (Pause) Okay, I bit my tongue, but I’m still
really sorry!"
296,Rachel, (closing a book) Okay! I’m ready.
297,Ross, You sure?
298,Rachel," Yes, I’ve done my studying and I really know my stuff."
299,Ross," All right then. (Gets up, in an announcer’s voice) Rachel Green!
Let’s play Bamboozled! (Reading from a note card.) How do you test the temperature of
the baby’s bath water?"
300,Rachel," Uh, put your elbow in it."
301,Ross, Excellent! How do you put a baby down for a nap?
302,Rachel," Full, dry, on its back, and no loose covers."
303,Ross," That’s correct! This is an audio question, what do you do when the
baby makes this sound? (Makes a sound like someone is choking a cat.)"
304,Rachel," Check if it’s wet, check if it’s hungry, burp it!"
305,Ross," Excellent! Excellent, now-now do you want another question or a Wicked
Wango card?"
306,Rachel, A card! A card! I pick a card!
307,Ross," Oh, I’m sorry you’ve been Bamboozled! You’re gonna be a
terrible mother! (Rachel stares at him agape.) I’ve lost sight of why we’re
doing this! (Rachel gets up and walks away.)"
0,Ross," Hey you guys I got some bad news. (He sets the stack of papers down on the
table.)"
1,Phoebe," Well that’s no way to sell newspapers. Why don’t you try,
""Extra! Extra! Read all about it!"""
2,Ross," No, Monica’s restaurant got a horrible review in the Post. (They all
gasp.) I didn’t want her to see it, so I ran around the neighborhood and bought all
the copies I could find. (He hands the paper to Phoebe and they all read it.)"
3,Joey," Man, this is bad! And I’ve had my share of bad reviews. I still
remember my first good one though. (Quoting) ""Everything else in this production of Our
Town was simply terrible. Joey Tribbiani was abysmal."""
4,Monica, (entering) Hey!
5,Chandler, Hey.
6,Monica," (seeing the stack of newspapers) Oh my God! Look at all the newspapers!
It must be a good review! Is it great?!"
7,Ross, Umm…
8,Monica, (reading) Oh dear God!
9,Ross," But the good news is, no one in a two-block radius will ever know."
10,Monica, What about the rest of Manhattan?!
11,Ross," Yeah, they all know."
12,Monica," Oh my God, this is horrible!"
13,Chandler, I’m so sorry.
14,Monica, I’m so humiliated!
15,Rachel," Yeah but y’know what they say Mon, ""There’s no such thing
as bad press."""
16,Monica," You don’t think that umm, (reading) ""The chef’s Mahi Mahi
was awful awful,"" is bad press?"
17,Rachel, I didn’t write it.
18,Monica, Is he right? Am I really—Am I awful?
20,Joey," Yeah! Yeah Monica! You listen to me, okay? And I’m not just saying
this because I’m your friend, I’m sayin’ it ‘cause it’s the
truth. You’re food is abysmal!"
23,Rachel, Ross!
24,Ross, (startling him) What?! What?
25,Rachel, I am freaking out!
26,Ross, Are ya?
27,Rachel, My due date is in one week! 
28,Ross, What are you doing up?
29,Rachel, That is seven days!
30,Ross," Okay look, I had a lot of water before I went to bed. Can we do this
after…"
31,Rachel," (interrupting him) No-no-no-no-no Ross! Please, come on we do not have
any of the big stuff we need! We do not a changing table! We do not have a crib! We do not
have a diaper service!"
32,Ross, It’s funny you should mention diapers.
33,Rachel, I’m serious.
34,Ross," Okay look, there’s nothing to worry about. We have plenty of time.
There’s a great baby furniture store on west 10th. Tomorrow, we will go
there and we will get you everything that you need. Okay?"
35,Rachel," Okay. Thank you. That’s great. Thank you. Wait-wait! Where on west
10th? Because there’s this really cute shoe store that has like this
little…"
36,Ross," (interrupting her) Okay. Okay. If uh, if you’re gonna do this, then
I’m gonna do that. (Points to the bathroom.) So… (Starts for the bathroom.)"
37,Rachel," (stopping him) Oh, wait Ross! I’m sorry, one more thing!"
38,Ross, (annoyed) Yeah!
39,Rachel," Umm, our situation. Y’know umm, what we mean to each other. And I
mean we-we’re having this baby together, and we live together. Isn’t that,
isn’t that weird?"
40,Ross, (stunned) (thinks) Well uh…
41,Rachel, I’m just kidding! You can go pee! (He does so in a hurry.)
43,Joey," (entering) Hey uh Monica, I can’t remember. Did we say we were gonna
meet here or at the movies?"
44,Monica," We said at the movies, but…"
45,Joey," Okay, I’ll see you there. (Starts to leave) "
46,Monica, Joey! (He returns) Now that you’re here…
47,Joey," Sure, I can hang out ‘til I have to meet ya. (To Chandler) What
uh—How come you’re not going?"
48,Chandler, I have a job interview I have to get ready for.
49,Joey, I thought you already have a job.
50,Chandler," And people say you don’t pay attention. No, this is a much better
job. It’s vice-president of a company that does data reconfiguration and statistical
factoring for other companies."
51,Joey, Wow! How do you know how to do that?!
52,Chandler, That’s what I do now.
53,Monica," Hey Joey, come taste this."
54,Joey, What is it?
55,Monica," Remember that guy that gave me a bad review? Well… (Feeds him a
spoonful of what she’s cooking.) I’m getting my revenge!"
56,Joey, You cooked him?
57,Monica," No. He teaches a course on food criticism at the New School, so before
we go to the movies I wanna go by there and make him try my bouillabaisse again. Oh, I
cannot wait to read the front page of the Post tomorrow! ""Restaurant reviewer admits
I was wrong about Monica."""
58,Chandler," The front page? You really do live in your own little world,
don’t ya?"
61,Rachel, Oh.
62,Ross, Oh.
63,Rachel," No-no-no! No, no, no, we’re not married."
64,Ross," We are having a baby together, but we’re not involved. (The cashier,
a very beautiful woman, looks confused) I mean, uh we-we were seeing each other a while
ago, but then we were just friends. And then there was one drunken night. (Rachel looks at
him angrily) Or, yes stranger, we’d like this delivered please."
66,Ross," Oh, okay."
68,Rachel," Oh yeah! Actually, that’s one of the reasons why we’re not a
couple."
69,Ross," I chose those, I’m a paleontologist."
71,Rachel," Oh. Oh yeah, don’t get to worked up over it. I mean it-it sounds
like he’s a doctor, but he’s not."
73,Ross, Yeah! I-I teach it in my class.
74,Rachel," Oh my God! I’m standing at a cash register, holding a credit card,
and I’m bored."
76,Ross, That’s my gym.
78,Ross, I am like Indiana Jones.
80,Rachel, Hi Pheebs!
81,Phoebe," Hey! Oh, how did baby shopping go?"
82,Rachel," Oh, it was great! We got everything that we needed! Oh and Ross, almost
got something that wasn’t on the list. A whore."
83,Phoebe, What?!
84,Rachel," Well, we were paying for our stuff and this saleswoman just started
flirting with him."
85,Phoebe, Well did she know you two weren’t married?
86,Rachel, Yeah.
87,Phoebe," Oh my God! Well the idea of a woman flirting with a-with a single man,
we-we must alert the church elders!"
88,Rachel, You don’t understand! You didn’t see how brazen she was.
89,Phoebe, Sounds like you’re a little jealous.
90,Rachel," No! I’m not! I-I-I just think it’s wrong! It’s-it’s
that I’m—Here I am about to pop and he’s out picking up some shop girl at
Sluts ‘R’ Us!"
91,Phoebe, Is that a real place? (Rachel’s stunned) Are they hiring?
92,Chandler, (entering) Hey Phoebe! (To Rachel) Fatty!
93,Phoebe," Hey Chandler, why so fancy?"
94,Chandler," Well, I got a job interview. It’s kinda a big deal too. Its a lot
more money and I’d be doing data reconfiguration and statistical factoring."
95,Phoebe," Wait, I think I know someone who does that."
96,Chandler," Me! I do that. So… Seriously, do I look okay? I’m little
nervous."
97,Rachel, Oh yeah! You really—You look great.
98,Phoebe," Yeah, just don’t get your hopes up."
99,Chandler, Why not?
100,Phoebe," Well, the interview…"
101,Chandler, What about it?
102,Phoebe, Y’know! You don’t make a very good first impression.
103,Chandler, (shocked) What?!
104,Phoebe, Oh you don’t know.
105,Chandler, Are you serious?!
106,Phoebe," Yes, when I first met you, you were like, ""Blah, blah, blah.""
I was like, shhh!"
107,Chandler, What is it that I do?
108,Phoebe," Well it’s just like you’re trying too hard. Always making
jokes, y’know, you just—You come off a little needy."
109,Chandler, (To Rachel) Did you like me when we first met?
110,Rachel," Chandler, I’m not gonna lie to ya, but I am gonna run away from
you. (Gets up and hurries out.)"
112,Monica," Hi! Umm, I’m Monica Geller, I’m the chef at Alessandro’s."
114,Monica," I think the things that you said about me are really unfair, and I would
like for you to give my bouillabaisse another chance."
116,Joey," Either eat it, or be in it."
117,Monica," Spoon? (Hands him one and he tastes it.) So, what do you think?"
119,Joey," Thata girl! Huh? We should get out of here; there’s a new class
comin’ in."
122,Monica, I can.
124,Monica," Well umm, they both have a egg yolk and butter base, but a bearnaise has
shallots, shirvel, and most importantly tarragon. "
126,Monica, Monica.
128,Monica, Okay. (Does so.)
130,Rachel," All this stuff takes up a lot of room. Hey how uh, how serious are you
about keeping Ben in your life?"
131,Ross," My son? Pretty serious. (There’s a knock on the door and Ross answers
it.) Oh hey Katie! (The cashier from before) What uh, what are you doing here?"
133,Ross," Ah, must’ve been fairly obvious since it was the only thing left in
your store."
135,Ross," Oh. (Reaches into his pocket for some money as Rachel enters the living
room and watches holding two stuffed dinosaurs.)"
137,Ross," Oh! Wow! Uh, yeah! That sounds great. I’m just gonna put this (The
money) back in my pocket, pretend that didn’t happen. Uh yeah, actually
I’m free now. Do you wanna grab some coffee or…"
139,Rachel," Horny bitch. (They both look at her, pretending that the dinosaurs
she’s holding are arguing.) No! You’re a horny bitch! Noooo! You’re the
horny bitch! No! You’re a horny bitch!"
142,Rachel," So you guys go, have a really good time."
143,Ross," (To Katie) Yeah, I’m just gonna grab my coat. And uh, and my whip.
(Katie looks worried.) Y’know because of the Indiana Jones? (Katie laughs) Not-not
because I’m-I’m into S&M. (Katie’s worried again.) I’m
not-I’m not into anything weird. Y’know? Just-just normal sex. (Katie is
uncomfortable.) So, I’m gonna grab my coat. (Does so, leaving Katie and Rachel
alone.)"
144,Rachel," So, you had a good day huh? Big commission; picked up a daddy."
146,Rachel," Oh yeah! Yeah please, you guys have fun."
148,Rachel," Oh and it was great to see you too. And you look fantastic, although you
missed a button."
150,Rachel," Oh okay, I see what you’re doing there."
152,Chandler, I can’t even believe this! I really come off that badly?
153,Phoebe," Oh! It’s okay, you calm down after a while and then people can see
how really sweet and wonderful you really are."
154,Chandler," Oh good. Good, because I’m sure this interview is gonna last a
couple of weeks."
155,Phoebe," All right, don’t freak out! Okay? I-I will help you. How
long before you have to leave?"
156,Chandler, An hour.
157,Phoebe, I can’t help you.
158,Chandler, Phoebe!
159,Phoebe," All right, all right, we’ll just do our best. Okay? So let’s
say I’m the interviewer and I’m meeting you for the first time. Okay. ""Hi!
Come on in, I’m uh, Regina Philange."""
160,Chandler, Chandler Bing.
161,Phoebe," Bing, what an unusual name."
162,Chandler," Well you should meet my uncle, Bada. (Pause) I’ll let myself out."
164,Joey, Hi.
166,Joey," When you say used, do you mean eat as a pre-cooking snack?"
168,Joey, Cheese makes me thirsty.
170,Joey, All right.
172,Monica," Oh no! I don’t know anything about cooking. I had to ask someone
what it’s called when the, when the water makes those little bubbles."
174,Monica," I-I-I’m sorry, your-your mouth was full, I didn’t hear what
you said. Umm, hats off to who now?"
176,Monica, That’s right.
178,Chandler," …I think you’ll find if I come to work here, I don’t
micro-manage. I don’t shy away from delegating."
179,Phoebe," Um-hmm, that’s good to know. But let’s stop focusing on what
you don’t do, and start focusing on what you do do."
180,Chandler," (suppressing a smile) What I do do…is manage to uh, create an
atmosphere of support for the people working with me."
181,Phoebe, I see. Nice sidestep on the do do thing by the way.
182,Chandler, Hardest thing I’ve ever done in my life.
183,Phoebe, You gotta go!
184,Chandler, Oh! (Stands up.)
185,Phoebe," Okay, don’t worry. You’re ready."
186,Chandler, Really?
187,Phoebe," Absolutely! Just fight all your natural instincts and you’ll be
great."
188,Chandler, Okay.
191,Monica," Y’know, you called me that before so I-I took the liberty of
fashioning a star out of aluminum foil. Now, no pressure, you like my cookies, you give me
the star. (Hands it to her.)"
193,Monica," Wow! A star! (The class glares at her.) I know you all hate me and-and
I’m sorry, but I don’t care."
196,Joey," I can an A? In-in school? (To Joey) Hey, I’m a dork."
197,Monica, Joey! I’m so proud of you!
199,Monica, Excuse me? He doesn’t even know what he’s doing!
201,Monica," I do! I’m a professional chef! (The class gasps.) Oh relax!
It’s not a courtroom drama!"
203,Joey, Yeah!
204,Monica," I’m-I’m sorry, it’s just that umm… Well I-I cook at
this restaurant, Alessandro’s, and umm I just got a really bad review…"
206,Monica, You do?
208,Monica," Oh, I’m totally crazy, but you-you like the food?"
210,Monica," Okay then, I don’t stink. I’m a good chef. Okay. (Starts to
leave.)"
211,Joey, Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! I don’t want to go. I’m having fun.
213,Joey," Hey-hey-hey, if my friend says it’s time to go, it’s time to go.
(Starts to leave, but comes back for his cookies.)"
215,Chandler," …also I was the point person on my company’s transition from
the KL-5 to GR-6 system."
217,Chandler, That I did. That I did.
219,Chandler, (nervous) My duties? (Trying not to crack a joke) All right.
221,Chandler, (trying not to laugh) I see.
223,Chandler, (really try not to laugh) Good to know.
225,Chandler, No don’t I beg of you!
227,Chandler, (relieved) Really?!
229,Chandler," Yeah I gotta say thank you, I was really nervous. Y’know
I’ve been told I come on to strong, make to many jokes, and then it was really hard
to sidestep that duty thing. (The interviewer doesn’t understand) Duties. (Still
doesn’t.) Duties! (Still doesn’t.) Poo. (Still doesn’t.)"
231,Chandler," Oh my God this doesn’t count! Okay? The interview was over, that
was the real Chandler Bing in there, this is just some crazy guy out in the hall! Call
security! There’s a crazy guy out in the hall!"
233,Chandler, I’ll look forward to your call. (Walks away.)
235,Ross, Hey.
236,Rachel, Hi! You’re back from your date!
237,Ross, How are you?
238,Rachel," I’m fine, but that’s not important. What’s important is
how was she?"
239,Ross," Uhh, it was fun. We, we just had coffee."
240,Rachel," Oh uh-huh, uh-huh, coffee, a little rub-rub-rub under the table."
241,Ross," What’s uh, what’s going on? Do you not, do you not like Katie?"
242,Rachel," No! No, she’s—She was nice. I mean, she’s a little
slutty, but who isn’t?"
243,Ross, I liked her.
244,Rachel," Of course you did Ross, you would date a gorilla if it called you
Indiana Jones!"
245,Ross, Did you get like a fresh batch of pregnancy hormones today?!
246,Rachel," No! It’s just that, Kate bothered me. "
247,Ross, Why? What was wrong with her?
248,Rachel, There was nothing wrong with her! All right? She was perfectly lovely!
249,Ross," Okay, so what’s the matter?"
250,Rachel, I don’t want you to date her!
251,Ross," (laughs) Why? What, what are you jealous?"
252,Rachel," Yes! And not because I want you to go out with me, but because I
don’t want you to go out with anybody! Okay? I know it’s a terrible thing to
even think this, and it’s completely inappropriate, but I want you to be at my
constant beck and call 24 hours a day! I’m very sorry, but that is just the way that
I feel."
253,Ross, Okay.
254,Rachel, What?!
255,Ross," I won’t date. I’ll uh, I’ll be here, with you, all the
time."
256,Rachel, Really? But I’m being so unreasonable.
257,Ross," True, but you’re allowed to be unreasonable. You’re having our
baby."
259,Rachel," (starting to cry) Oh Ross, thank you. Thank you. (They hug.)"
260,Ross, Do you feel better?
261,Rachel," No, not really. You’re pressing the baby into my bladder and now I
have to pee. Sorry. (She gets up and starts for the bathroom.)"
262,Ross, Uh Rach?
263,Rachel, Yeah. (Stops and starts doing the I-have-to-go-to-the-bathroom dance.)
264,Ross, Just one thing umm…
265,Rachel, Uh-huh.
266,Ross," We live together. You’re having our baby. I’m not gonna see
anybody else. Are you-are you sure you don’t want something more?"
267,Rachel," (pause) Wow! I don’t know, maybe. I’m…"
268,Ross," Oh-oh, Rach! I was just messin’ around! (She’s stunned) Like you
did last night when I had to pee?"
269,Rachel," (laughs) I knew that! I knew that! I was just messin’ with you too!
"
270,Ross, (pause) Okay. Okay. Because for a minute you said you…
271,Rachel," Oh no-no-no-no, no!"
272,Ross, …that you actually…
273,Rachel," No that’s just—(Laughs)—That’s just ‘cause
I’m such a good messer!"
275,Ross, Rach?
276,Rachel, Yeah?
277,Ross, The bathroom?
278,Rachel, Right! (Heads for the bathroom.)
281,Joey," Well I had a great time! Learned how to bake, ate great food, that’s
the first A I’ve gotten since seventh grade, and I didn’t have to sleep
with the teacher this time."
282,Monica," Oh, look! Acting for Beginners! Want to feel good about yourself?"
283,Joey, What the hell!
284,Monica, Okay.
288,Joey," Yeah, this was a stupid idea. (Exits.)"
0,Ross, Hey! What are you guys looking at?
1,Joey," Oh, it’s a poster for that World War I movie that I’m in, check
it out."
2,Ross, Yeah? Wow! It looks really violent!
3,Joey," Uh-huh! I know. I’m coming soon to a theater near you! I’m in
THX! I’m unsuitable for children!"
4,Ross, Now I cannot wait to see this.
5,Joey," Yeah, yeah, it’s already generating Oscar buzz."
6,Phoebe, I started that!
7,Joey," I thought I did! Oh hey guess what? The premiere is next week and
you’re all invited! (They all gasp.)"
8,Monica, Are we gonna take a limo?
9,Joey, Sure! Why not?!
10,Monica, Oh I love taking limos when nobody died!
11,Rachel," Well obviously I won’t be able to come, for those of you who
haven’t checked their calendars today is my due date. Well y’know, I just want
to take a moment and thank you guys for how great you’ve been during this time. I
really couldn’t have done it without you. And I have loved these last nine
months! And even though I am so looking forward to the next part, I am really gonna miss
being pregnant."
13,Rachel," That’s right, still no baby! (To Monica, Joey, and Chandler on the
couch) Come on people! Please make some room!"
14,Ross," Uh sweetie, maybe you’d be more comfortable here? (Gets up from the
green armchair.)"
15,Rachel, You. Like you haven’t done enough.
16,Ross," Look, I-I know how miserable you are, I wish there was something I can do.
I mean I wish I were a seahorse. (She glares at him) Because with seahorses it’s the
male, they carry the babies. And then also umm, I’d be far away in the sea. (He sits
back down.)"
18,Rachel, God. (Sits down.) I have never been so uncomfortable in my entire life!
19,Phoebe," Oh I know, I’ve been there. I remember toward the end…"
20,Rachel," (interrupting her) Oh Phoebe, that’s a great story. Can you tell it
to me when you’re getting me some iced tea? (Phoebe gets up and Rachel groans.) (To
the baby) Oh God, get out! Get out!! Get out!! Get out!!"
21,Chandler, Let’s. (Everyone gets up and leaves Rachel.)
24,Chandler, Hey! Did you have the baby yet?
25,Rachel," Do you want me to come over there and sit on you? ‘Cause I’ll
do it."
26,Monica, What are you doing here so early?
27,Rachel," They sent me home from work. They were like, ""Start your maternity
leave now! Just rest, get ready for the baby."" Well y’know what? Screw ‘em!
If they don’t want me there, I’ll just hang out with you guys."
28,Phoebe, Or you can do volunteer work.
30,Joey, Hello?
32,Joey, One guest? You told me I can have six tickets!
34,Joey, Oh my God. So that’s it?! I only get to bring one guest?
36,Joey," (to Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe) Did you hear that? I only get one extra
ticket to my premiere. So some how I have to pick between you three and Ross."
37,Rachel, (overhearing that) What-what about me?
38,Joey, You said you didn’t want to go.
39,Rachel," I don’t. But I would still like to be acknowledged. What? Just
because I’m pregnant you think I’m invisible."
40,Joey, Definitely not invisible.
41,Monica," Well, well Ross didn’t care enough to be here, so I think he’s
out. You snooze you lose."
42,Chandler," He’s not snoozing, he’s teaching a class."
43,Monica," Well then somebody’s snoozing. Joey, not that this uh should affect
you at all, but if you were to pick me, I was planning on wearing a sequined dress, cut
down to here. (Points to her stomach just above her belly button.)"
44,Chandler, I haven’t seen this dress.
45,Monica, Star in a movie.
46,Phoebe," Joey, you pick who ever you want. Okay? You just listen to your heart.
What does it tell you? (Mimicking a heartbeat and tapping her chest.) Phoebe, Phoebe."
47,Joey, Well uh…I think I want to take Chandler.
48,Phoebe," (still mimicking a heartbeat, only faster)
Phoebe-Phoebe-Phoebe-Phoebe—Burrrrr! (Mimics the sound of a cardiac monitor going
off.)"
49,Chandler, You really want to take me?
50,Joey," Yeah! Yeah! I mean I’m sorry, I wish I can take everybody, but
y’know Chandler always supported my career. He’s paid for acting classes and
head shots and stuff and well this will be my way of paying you back."
51,Chandler, So you’re never actually going to pay me back?
52,Monica," Wait a minute, just because he paid for your head shots you’re
gonna take him? Joey, I don’t think you’re comprehending just how slutty this
dress is!"
53,Joey," It’s not just the stuff he paid for, I mean it’s-it’s
everything. Y’know? He read lines with me. He-he went with me on auditions when I was
really nervous, and then he consoled me after I didn’t get parts that I really
wanted. You always believed in me man. Even, even when I didn’t believe in myself."
54,Chandler, I always knew you were gonna make it. I’m so proud of you.
55,Joey, Thanks. That means a lot to me.
57,Phoebe," Mon, maybe one of these guys wants to wear your dress."
58,Joey, (in a manly voice) I’m gonna go shave. (Gets up.)
59,Chandler," (in a manly voice) Yeah well, I’m gonna go spit. (He goes into
the bedroom. On his way out, Joey gives Rachel a wide berth.)"
60,Rachel," Oh, I have to pee. If I don’t come out in five minutes it’s
because I’ve choked to death on the potpourri stink. (Goes into the bathroom.)"
61,Phoebe," When she comes out, you hold her nose, I’ll blow in her mouth, and
the kid will just (makes a popping sound) right out of her."
62,Monica," She’s over a week late! She gotta have it today, right?"
63,Phoebe, I don’t know. I-I think it’s still gonna be a while.
64,Monica," Hmm, care to make it interesting? I’ll bet you that she’ll
have it by this time tomorrow."
65,Phoebe, You’re on!
66,Monica," Okay, how much?"
67,Phoebe, One hundred thousand dollars!
68,Monica, How about fifty bucks?
69,Phoebe, Fine! I’ll call Zurich and move some money around.
70,Rachel," (calling from the bathroom) All right, who’s turn is it to help me
get up!"
72,Phoebe, No one’s here! (Monica looks at her.) Oh damnit!
74,Chandler," This is so exciting! It’s so glamorous! People taking our
picture. How do I look?"
75,Joey, A little tall.
76,Chandler, What?
77,Joey," Do you mind crouching down a little bit, so that I look taller? (Chandler
does so) There you go. (And they walk down the red carpet.)"
78,Chandler, It’s just so glamorous.
80,Phoebe," Oh hey Mon? Rach is here! Ohh, you’re still pregnant. Oh, I’m
sorry. I know how uncomfortable you are. Y’know what? You look great. Yeah, like
fifty bucks."
81,Rachel," Oh, I have to go pee. Apparently this baby thinks that my bladder is a
squeeze toy. (Goes to the bathroom.)"
82,Monica, Damnit! Damnit!! Here’s your fifty bucks! (Pays Phoebe.)
83,Phoebe," It’s interesting that you lost. Now, I forget, do you like to lose?"
84,Monica, Now stop it! Double or nothing that she has it by tomorrow!
85,Phoebe, Fine! You’re on!
86,Monica, Okay.
87,Phoebe," Until then, General Grant, why don’t you set up camp (She puts the
bill in her bra) right there."
88,Ross, (entering) Hey is Rachel here? We have a doctor’s appointment.
89,Monica, She’s in the bathroom.
90,Ross," Rach, we gotta go."
91,Rachel, In a minute!!!
92,Ross," People ask me why we’re not together, I just don’t know what to
tell them."
93,Rachel," (entering) All right, all right. Let’s go!"
94,Ross," Uh, do you wanna go change first? The doctor’s keeping the office
open late for us, but if you hurry…"
95,Rachel," No, I’m fine."
96,Ross," Really? You don’t think that’s a little inappropriate.
(She’s wearing a tank top and has her belly sticking out.)"
97,Phoebe, Good God man don’t anger it.
98,Rachel," Ross, it is 100 degrees outside. For the first time in weeks, I am
somewhat comfortable."
99,Ross," Fine! Fine! Y’know what? Whatever you want. Okay? You’re the
mommy."
100,Rachel," Oh uh-uh pal! Don’t call me mommy! It’s bad enough you call
your own mother that. (He looks at Monica.)"
101,Monica, I’m actually with her on this one.
103,Joey," (onscreen) ""I thought I knew who the enemy was, but it was you all
along."" "
104,Joey," (To Chandler) Okay, this is it. It’s my big fight scene coming up.
(He looks over and Chandler and notices that he’s asleep.)"
106,Rachel, Ross.
107,Ross, Yeah?
108,Rachel, Can I ask you something?
109,Ross, Uh-huh.
110,Rachel, When Carol was pregnant with Ben…
111,Ross, Mmm?
112,Rachel, …were you this irritating?
113,Ross, Wow!
114,Rachel, Excuse me?!
115,Ross," Oh nothing. Nothing! Just uh, you’ve been a little short with me
lately. I’m not trying to irritate you."
116,Rachel, Well then you just must have a natural talent for it.
117,Ross," Y’know what? The doctor will be in soon, why don’t we not speak
until then."
118,Rachel," (silently) Okay. (Pause) Seriously, breathe louder Ross! That’s
great!"
119,Ross," Y’know we should probably ask the doctor if she even knows how to
deliver a baby that’s half human and half pure evil!"
121,Rachel," Hi Dr. Long, how are you?"
122,Ross," (to Rachel) Oh, you’re nice to her."
123,Rachel, She has the drugs!
125,Rachel, Okay. (Rachel lies back.)
127,Rachel, Yeah.
129,Rachel," Eh, just a tad."
131,Ross, Do them!!
133,Rachel," Well, we are ready to try anything."
135,Rachel, Okay.
137,Rachel, Great! We will do all of those.
140,Ross, You’ve got to be kidding me!
143,Chandler, Good job Joe! Well done! Top notch!
144,Joey, You liked it? You really liked it?
145,Chandler," Oh-ho-ho, yeah!"
146,Joey, Which part exactly?
147,Chandler, The whole thing! Can we go?
148,Joey," Oh no-no-no, give me some specifics."
149,Chandler," I love the specifics, the specifics were the best part!"
150,Joey," Hey, what about the scene with the kangaroo? Did-did you like that part?"
151,Chandler, I was surprised to see a kangaroo in a World War I epic.
152,Joey," You fell asleep!! There was no kangaroo! They didn’t take any of my
suggestions! That’s for coming buddy. I’ll see you later. (Starts to walk out.)"
153,Chandler," Don’t go! I’m sorry. I’m so sorry! (Sees another guy
who is still asleep.) Look! This guy fell asleep! He fell asleep too! Be mad at him!
(Looks at him more closely.) Or, call an ambulance."
155,Monica, Hey!
156,Ross, Hey.
157,Rachel, Hi!
158,Monica, What did the doctor say? Any news on when the baby will come?
159,Rachel, No. But she did give us some ideas on how to induce labor.
160,Ross," Yeah, we tried them all. We went for a walk, uh we tried a special tea,
caster oil, spicy food nothing has worked."
161,Rachel," Well, there is one thing that we haven’t tried, but someone thinks
that, (mimicking Ross) ""That will open up a can of worms."""
162,Monica," Well what is it? What is it? If it’s gonna help bring the baby
here, like today. I mean, I think you should do it."
163,Ross, It’s sex.
164,Monica, Do it!
165,Ross, Monica!
166,Monica," I’m just saying it’s been a really long time for you. I mean,
women have needs. Do it, get yours!"
167,Phoebe," Oh I-I don’t know about that. No, I think that if the two of you
had sex the-the-the repercussions would be catastrophic. "
168,Monica," All right, let’s be practical, if Ross isn’t willing to do it,
he’s not the only guy in the world you can have sex with. You can borrow
Chandler—Chandler is good!"
169,Ross," Monica, what is the matter with you?"
170,Monica, Nothing. I just want the baby to be born today.
171,Rachel, Why? Why today?
172,Monica," Okay fine! I keep betting Phoebe that you’re gonna have the baby
and I don’t want to lose again!"
173,Ross," What?! While she’s been going through this hell, you’ve been
making money?! You’re betting on your friend staying in this misery?! (Phoebe lowers
her head and shakes it yes.)"
174,Rachel, I’ll take that bet.
175,Ross, What?!
176,Rachel," Well, I’m miserable here! I might as well make some money out it!"
177,Ross, Can I get some of that action?
178,Monica, Wait a minute! Now I’m betting against all three of you?
179,Rachel," Oh honey, don’t worry. I really do feel like tomorrow’s the
day."
180,Monica," Oh, okay!"
183,Joey, Hey! Sleeping beauty!
184,Chandler," Where have you been?! I tried to call you! I want to talk to you! I
still feel so bad!"
185,Joey," (in a baby voice) Oh no, were you upset? Did you lose sleep?"
186,Chandler, I’m so sorry.
187,Joey," Uh-huh look, the only reason I can over here was to settle things between
us! Okay? You’ve done a lot for me and my career, I wanted to pay you back so I took
you to the premiere but you missed it! Okay, so how much do I owe you?"
188,Chandler, What?!
189,Joey," Give me a number, I don’t want to owe you anything!"
190,Chandler," You don’t owe me anything, I don’t want you money…"
191,Joey," Ah-ah-ah! We’re doing this! Okay, now you got me my first set of head
shots. Right, how much were those?"
192,Chandler," I don’t know, five hundred dollars?"
193,Joey," Okay, five hundred dollars. What else?"
194,Chandler," Well then there was the second set, the infamous booger head shots."
195,Joey," Okay, so that’s another five hundred. Five hundred and five hundred,
that’s… (Pauses to figure it out.)"
196,Chandler, Do you want a calculator?
197,Joey, Please! 
198,Chandler," Here! (Hands him one. Joey adds it up and discovers that he was
right.)"
199,Joey," All right, what else?"
200,Chandler," Well uh, there was acting classes, stage combat classes, tap
classes…"
201,Joey, Which we’re still keeping under our hats!
202,Chandler," Uh then there was that dialect coach who helped you with that play
where you needed a southern accent. Which after twenty hours of lessons still came out
Jamaican. "
203,Joey," What the hell are you talking about, (in a Jamaican accent) ""The
south will rise again man."""
204,Chandler," Yes, money well spent!"
205,Joey," Yeah. Okay, what else? Rent!"
206,Chandler," Okay, two, three years of rent, utilities, food…"
207,Joey," Okay. Okay, so I’m writing you a check for…So you fell asleep
during my movie. Big deal right? How do you clear this thing?"
209,Ross," Come on, finish your enchilada."
210,Rachel, Ross I—We tried all the spicy food. It’s not working.
211,Ross," Okay here, have one of these peppers. Oh ha… Oh God! So…so hot!
(Rubs his eyes.) Oh my—(Laughs.) By the way, you don’t want to touch the pepper
and then touch your eye."
212,Rachel," I am feeling nothing. Speaking of hot, watching you do that really makes
me want to have sex with you."
213,Ross, Stop it.
214,Rachel," Oh come on Ross, why are we wasting our time with this other stuff?! We
know what’s gonna work! It’s doctor recommended!"
215,Ross," I’m sorry, but we have to have some boundaries! My God, I’m
dying."
216,Rachel," Oh come on Ross, we’ve done it before we’ll do it again,
it’ll be a nice way to bookend the pregnancy."
217,Ross," This is insane, I’m not gonna make love to you just so that
you’ll go into labor."
218,Rachel, Make love? What are you a girl?
219,Ross, Always a great way to get in a man’s pants.
220,Rachel," But you will, you will be performing a service. Okay? Just-just think of
me as a ketchup bottle, y’know you sometimes you have to bang on the end of it just
to get something to come out."
221,Ross, I love when you talk dirty to me.
222,Rachel," Oh, I know it. You’re right. That’s not sexy. Oh…Oh!
(Drops a fork on the floor.) Whoops! Oh, I seem to have dropped my fork. Let me just bed
over and get it. (Tries too, but can’t quite seem to make it.) Oh God!"
223,Ross," Okay enough! This is, this is not going to happen."
224,Rachel," Come on Ross! I’m miserable here! Come on! You started this, now
you finish it! Come on wuss, make love to me."
225,Ross, Y’know what?
226,Rachel, What?!
227,Ross, Forget it.
228,Rachel," Oh wow! What now Ross you’re not gonna talk? How on earth will you
ever annoy me? Oh wait a minute, I know. (Mimics his breathing.) I mean you’d think
the damn jalepeno would’ve cleared up your sinuses, but no!! That’s not
enough… (Ross jumps over and kisses her.) What are you doing?!"
229,Ross, I’m getting that baby out of you!
231,Rachel, (breaking the kiss) Oh God!
232,Ross," Oh, I know."
233,Rachel, Oh no. No-no! I think my water just broke.
234,Ross," I am good. Okay! Okay! Uh, I got the pillow! I got the bag! You got the
keys?"
235,Rachel, Okay! I got the keys! Okay! Okay!
236,Ross, Hey!
237,Rachel, Yeah.
238,Ross, We’re having a baby.
240,Rachel," I didn’t uh, really have time to read this part of the books, but
do you think we have time to…"
241,Ross, Not so much.
242,Rachel, Okay.
245,Monica, Two hundred.
246,Phoebe, Thank you!
247,Monica," That’s it. I’m done. I don’t care when the baby comes, no
more betting."
248,Phoebe, Okay.
250,Monica," Hello? (Listens) Uh-huh. (Listens) Uh-huh. (Listens) Okay. (Hangs up.) I
guess we can bet one more time."
251,Phoebe, Is Rachel having the baby?
252,Monica," How did you know that?! (Runs to yell at Joey’s apartment.) Joey!
Chandler!! It’s time!"
253,Phoebe, They’re at the coffeehouse.
254,Monica," You know everything!! Oh wait, double or nothing. I bet you the baby is
over seven pounds. (Phoebe isn’t interested.) I bet you it has hair. (She’s
still not interested.) I bet you it’s a girl."
255,Phoebe, We know it’s a girl! (Exits.)
256,Monica, (following her) I’ll give you really good odds.
0,Ross," All right! (Checking his watch) Yes!! From home to the hospital in under
seven minutes! We did it!!"
1,Rachel," (deadpan) Yes, the hard part is truly over."
2,Ross," No, but come on, we’re off to a great start aren’t we? I knew
I’d get you here fast, but this has got to be some kind of a record!"
4,Phoebe, Oh you made it!
5,Rachel, Hi! (Ross is stunned.)
6,Monica, How are you doing?
7,Ross, Wait a minute! How-how the hell did you beat us here?
8,Monica, We took a cab. Did you guys walk?
9,Ross," N… No! We took a cab too, but I did test runs!"
11,Chandler, Hi!
12,Joey, Hey! You made it!
13,Ross, Okay is there…some kind of magic tunnel to this hospital?!
14,Rachel," Ross, you stay here and talk, I’m gonna go have a baby."
15,Ross," Okay. Okay. (To the nurse behind the desk.) Umm hi, this is Rachel Green.
I’m Ross Geller. We-we called from the car."
17,Rachel," (interrupting her) Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! I’m sorry, semi-private? We
(Laughs), we asked for a private room."
19,Chandler," Man, if only you’d gotten here sooner. (Ross turns and glares at
him.)"
21,Rachel, Okay. Just give us a second. Ross! (They walk away from the desk.)
22,Ross, Yeah?
23,Rachel, Give her some money.
24,Ross, I really think they’re out of rooms.
25,Rachel," They’re not!! Ross, they’re just saving them for the important
people!! Okay?! What-what if I was the president?!"
26,Ross," Well then we’d be in a lot of trouble, you don’t know where any
countries are. (Rachel glares at him.) Okay. (He goes over to the desk followed by
Rachel.) Uh, say would you umm… Would you mind checking again to see if any umm,
private rooms may have (Handing her some money) opened up?"
28,Rachel," (standing up) Okay. Y’know what? I’d have to say I really
don’t care for your tone. And this is not the only hospital in this city and we have
no problem to—Whoa! (She starts a contraction) Oh gosh! Whoa!"
29,Ross, What-what?
30,Rachel," Ow! Ow! Contraction. (Sits back down.) Ow-ow! Ow-ow! (Starts breathing
heavily.)"
32,Rachel," Yeah, it couldn’t hurt to look."
36,Rachel," Oh, okay."
38,Ross, Thank you.
39,Rachel," Thank you. (Dr. Long exits.) Well, I guess we have some time to kill."
40,Ross," Yeah, guess so. Whew! Check these out! (He’s looking at the stirrups
on the other bed in the room and Rachel groans. Ross then hops into the bed and puts his
legs into the stirrups.) Never done this before."
41,Rachel, Yeah well it looks great!
46,Ross," Hi! Hi, I’m uh Ross. I’m here to ruin this magical day for you."
50,Ross, Hi Julie.
52,Ross, This is Rachel. (Points at her.)
53,Rachel, Hi! 
55,Rachel, How are you?
57,Rachel, Yeah it is.
59,Rachel, That’s so sweet.
60,Ross, Yeah.
61,Rachel, Oh.
62,Ross," Umm say, I-I opened this earlier (The privacy screen) but let me give you
guys some privacy."
66,Ross," Oh, okay."
68,Rachel," Oh no, I really don’t want any—(He takes the picture)—Oh!
Thank you. Oh. Oh Ross…"
69,Ross, What?
70,Rachel, Here comes another contraction.
71,Ross," Oh. Okay, just breathe."
76,Phoebe," (looking at the clock) Oh wow, three hours and still no baby. Ugh, the
miracle of birth sure is a snooze fest."
77,Monica," Hey, you wanna see something?"
78,Phoebe, Sure! What?
79,Monica," Umm, this is going to be fun. Watch me freak out Chandler. Honey?"
80,Chandler, Yeah?
81,Monica," Listen uh, I-I’ve been doing some thinking, and I don’t know
whether it’s because we’re here or Rachel’s giving birth but umm, I think
we should try to have a baby."
82,Chandler, Okay.
83,Monica, (freaking out) What-what-what’s that now?!
84,Chandler," Okay. I’ve been thinking about it too, and I, I think we’re
ready."
85,Monica," What?! Are you kidding me?! You-you-you think we’re ready to have a
baby now?!"
86,Phoebe," Oh, this is fun."
87,Joey, You’re ready to have a baby? My boy’s all grown up!
88,Chandler, But you said you were ready too.
89,Monica," Yeah but I was just screwing with you to try to get your voice all high
and weird like mine is now!"
90,Chandler," Yes, but haven’t you wanted a kid like forever?"
91,Monica," Okay, just back off mister! Whoa. (Pause) ‘Cause I am ready
to have a baby. I just want Joey to be the father."
92,Joey, (voice all high and weird) What?! Are you crazy?!
93,Monica, That’s it! Right there! Is all I wanted!
96,Rachel," Oh, that’s very—Really very-very okay."
99,Rachel," (simultaneously as Ross) No, I don’t think we’ll be doing
that."
100,Ross, (simultaneously as Rachel) We’re not gonna do that.
103,Ross, Uh yes! Thank you.
104,Rachel, Oh. Oh wait no.
105,Ross, Later.
106,Rachel, No-no-don’t! Don’t leave me here with these people.
107,Ross," Oh uh, I’m sorry. (Runs out.)"
108,Rachel, No Ross! Ross! Ross! My child has no father!
110,Ross," Hi! I’m so glad you’re here, but it’s gonna be a while. I-I
wished you’d called first."
112,Ross, Oh good.
114,Ross," Okay, what’s up?"
116,Ross," Ma, you’re asking me to marry you?"
118,Ross," Mom no, come on! Thank you."
120,Ross," N-no! Okay? We’ve been through this! We’re not gonna get married
just because she’s pregnant, okay?"
122,Ross," Mom, y’know what? I-I can’t deal with this right now. I’m
sorry…"
124,Ross," Gimmie! (Takes the ring and puts it in his coat pocket as Rachel enters
the hallway.)"
125,Rachel, Hi!
127,Rachel," Oh, thank you so much for coming. Ross, get in here!"
130,Ross," …she came and dragged me out of the labor room to ask me why I’m
not with Rachel."
131,Phoebe, Yeah. (Pause) Why aren’t you with Rachel?
132,Ross," Are you kidding? Look, we’re not gonna be together just because
we’re having a baby. Okay?"
133,Phoebe, But y’know what? It just seems that you two belong together.
134,Ross," Okay, stop it! I can’t deal with this right now. I have to go have a
baby."
135,Phoebe, Right. And with who again? (Ross exits.)
136,Joey, God. He’s crazy! Why doesn’t he want to be with Rachel?
137,Phoebe, I know!
138,Joey," I mean seriously, she’s like the perfect woman. I mean I know she
turned me down, but if she hadn’t and wanted to be with me, I would take her in my
arms and… (Realizes everyone is staring.) I haven’t bummed you guys out like
this in a while have I?"
140,Ross, (To Rachel) Hey. Who’s that?
141,Rachel, New people.
142,Ross, What happened to the Disgustingtons?
143,Rachel," They’re having their baby! It’s not fair Ross we got here
first! Right after you left they wheeled her off into delivery. Oh but not before she gave
me a juicy shot of little Jamie just crowning away."
144,Ross," Wow! Sorry. So uh, how are the new people?"
145,Rachel," Well they have uh, some unusual pet names for each other. Including umm,
evil bitch and uh, sick bastard. Oh God oh! Contraction!"
146,Ross, Yeah? Okay.
147,Rachel, Ooh! Ow!!
153,Ross," Umm. Umm, I’m-I’m just gonna—(Closes the privacy screen.)"
155,Ross," No-no, I’m…I’m sure no one was looking. Just want some
privacy. (He closes the screen and stares wide-eyed at Rachel.)"
157,Ross, Just ignore them.
159,Rachel, Ross.
160,Ross, What? What?
161,Rachel, He’s looking at me.
162,Ross, (to him) Hey! You wanna live to see your baby?!
166,Monica, Oh good God! If you want a baby so bad just go steal it! 
168,Monica, What is going on with you? Since when are you so crazy about babies?
169,Chandler, I’m not crazy about babies. I’m crazy about us.
170,Monica, What?
171,Chandler," Look, we’ve always talked about having babies someday. I’m
not saying it has to be right now, but I’m starting to think that we can handle it.
We’re good. We’re really good."
172,Monica, We are pretty good.
173,Chandler, But nothing has to happen until your ready.
174,Monica," Well maybe I’m ready now. I mean, it’s a little scary, but
maybe it’s right."
175,Chandler, What?! It’s not right! We’re not ready to have a kid now!!
176,Monica, What?!!
177,Chandler, I’m kidding. This is going to be fun.
178,Monica," So we’re gonna try? I mean, are we trying?"
179,Chandler," We’re trying to get pregnant. (They start kissing, but Chandler
stops it.) Y’know I’m not really comfortable doing this in front of the babies.
So, when do you want to start trying?"
180,Monica," Okay, hold on a sec."
181,Chandler, Period math?
182,Monica, Yeah.
183,Chandler, Yeah.
184,Monica," Well, we could start trying. Now."
185,Chandler, Right here?
186,Monica," No, not here. Maybe here."
187,Chandler," Wait a minute, it’s perfect. We got a lot of time to kill and
we’re in a building that’s full of beds!"
188,Monica, And it’s so clean!!
192,Joey, Come on you stupid machine! Come on!
193,Phoebe," Oh, it ate your money?"
194,Joey, (looking at her) No.
195,Phoebe," All right, I’ll see you downstairs then."
196,Joey, All right.
197,Phoebe, All right.
198,Joey, Hey I got one! I got one!
201,Phoebe, Hi.
203,Phoebe," Oh down please. (The guy tries to reach the button, but can’t.) I-I
hate to be a ball buster can I just do it? (She pushes the button.)"
205,Phoebe, Sure! I feel so bad for you; I broke my leg once too.
207,Phoebe," Well, it’s a long story. It’s kind of embarrassing. Let’s
just say there was a typographical error with a sex manual. (The guy laughs.) How about
you?"
209,Phoebe, Oh.
212,Phoebe," Uh-huh, yeah."
214,Phoebe, Oh yeah! I-I would like that.
216,Phoebe, Wait! What?! No!! Elevator!! No!
217,Joey," (standing behind her) Uh, you gotta press the button. (Does so.)"
219,Ross, The nurse said they’re bringing in another woman.
220,Rachel," Ugh, is she pregnant yet? She doesn’t need to be; she’ll still
have the baby before I do. Oh Ross, another contraction! (Leans back on Ross for some
support.)"
221,Ross, That’s it. That’s it.
224,Rachel, Yeah it was.
228,Phoebe," (to the nurse) Excuse me? Could you help me with something? The patient
I’m looking for has a broken leg and is in a wheelchair. And umm, he’s like
early to mid-thirties, very attractive."
230,Phoebe," Oh yay! Great! Okay, what room number is he in?"
232,Joey," (walks up) Uh, she’s with me. (Introduces himself) Dr. Drake Remoray."
234,Joey," Remoray. It’s Portuguese. We need that information; I’m a
doctor."
236,Joey," Damnit woman we’re losing precious time! Now do you want this
man’s blood on your head?"
237,Phoebe, Hands.
238,Joey," Hands! It is absolutely essential that you tell me what room the man my
assistant described is staying in. He’s a patient of mine, I’ve been treating
him for years!"
240,Joey," 816, thank you! "
241,Phoebe, Thank you. (Starts to exit.)
243,Joey, And what is his name?
244,Phoebe, (coming back for Joey) No! (Grabs Joey and drags him away.)
246,Monica, I think we found a place.
247,Chandler, Okay. (They start kissing.)
248,Monica," Umm, wait! Do you want to set the mood a little?"
249,Chandler," Okay. Uh, we’ll dim the lights, dim the lights. (He goes to the
light switch and finds it’s not a dimmer switch when he flips the lights off.) Or
turn them out all together. Uh, no scented candles. Okay here. Here we go. (He sprays an
aerosol air freshener above her.)"
250,Monica," Okay! Okay! Make me sterile, but okay."
252,Monica," Okay. Let’s hurry—Oh wait! Do we have a condom? (He looks at
her.) Oh right! (Laughs and they resume making out when a nurse catches them in the act.)"
253,Chandler," Yes, 98.6. You’re gonna be fine."
255,Phoebe," Ooh, this is it! (Looks in the window.) Oh, that’s him! That’s
him!"
256,Joey, Great! Go get him.
257,Phoebe," Wait a second, or maybe you can go in first."
258,Joey, (looks in the window) He’s not really my type.
259,Phoebe," No not you, Dr. Drake Remoray. You can ask him questions and see
what’s he like. People tell doctors everything."
260,Joey, But you said he was this great guy!
261,Phoebe," But lately all the guys I meet seem really nice at first, then they turn
out to be the biggest jerks."
262,Joey, You do attract some stinkers.
264,Rachel," Dr. Long, I’ve been at this for seventeen hours! Three women have
come and gone with their babies, you gotta give me some good news! How many centimeters am
I dilated? Eight? Nine?"
266,Ross, Just three?! I’m dilated three!
268,Rachel," Hey, y’know what? I’m not waiting! I’m gonna push this
baby out! I’m doing it! I mean it’s what? Three centimeters? That’s gotta
be like this! (Holds her hands a couple inches apart.)"
269,Ross," Actually it’s more like this. (Pushes her hands to less than an inch
apart.)"
270,Rachel, Oh stupid metric system!
273,Rachel, Oh for the love of God! 
276,Rachel, Oh come on!!
278,Joey," Hi! I’m Dr. Drake Remoray and I have a few routine questions I need
to ask you."
280,Joey," I know, but I’m a neurologist. And just to be on the safe side, Dr.
Wells wanted a more comprehensive overview of you status so he sent me."
282,Joey," That was a test. Good response. All right, full name."
284,Joey, Date of birth? 
286,Joey, Age?
288,Joey," I’m a doctor Cliff, not a mathematician."
290,Joey," Okay. And uh, are you married."
292,Joey," Oh really? So, 33 and still single, would you say you have commitment
issues?"
294,Joey, (checking the list) Yes.
296,Joey, Oh that’s terrible. I’m-I’m really sorry.
298,Joey, Hmm. Do you sleep with women and never call them again?
300,Joey," Excellent! Excellent! And uh, finally, are you into any weird stuff
y’know, sexually?"
302,Joey," Oooh, wrong answer. (Exits.)"
305,Rachel," Okay! Okay wait! You listen to me! You listen to me! Since I have been
waiting four women, that’s four, one higher than the number of centimeters that I am
dilated, have come and gone with their babies! I’m next! It’s my turn! It’s
only fair! And if you bring in one woman and she has her baby before me I’m going to
sue you! Not this hospital, I’m going to sue you! And my husband (Points at Ross)
he’s a lawyer!"
306,Ross, Uh Rach…
307,Rachel, Go get back on that case honey!
309,Rachel," Okay, well then bring her in."
316,Ross, And yet somehow it’s true!
318,Ross, (To Rachel) Squeeze your legs together and cover the baby’s ears!
322,Ross, (softly) Really?
325,Rachel, Oh!
326,Ross, Oh there you go!
327,Rachel, I get it!
329,Rachel, Oh we-we didn’t.
330,Ross, No-no. We…
332,Ross," Um uh…We’re-we’re just having this baby together but uh, uh
that’s all."
334,Ross," Uh well umm…we’re just not in that place, y’know? But
we’re very excited about this."
336,Rachel, Just tell me how.
338,Ross, Sid you lucky deaf bastard.
340,Phoebe, What else? What else?
341,Joey," Uh, well he’s 33."
342,Phoebe, Oh. Ah-uh.
343,Joey, A widower.
344,Phoebe, Oh.
345,Joey," He seemed like a stand up guy. Oh, and he’s not into anything weird
sexually."
346,Phoebe, Enter Pheebs.
348,Chandler," Should we tell Rachel there’s an empty private room right next
door to hers?"
349,Monica," We could, or we can have sex in it."
350,Chandler," Well let me think about that, while I remove my pants!"
352,Monica, (lying down on the bed) Okay mister! Fertilize me!
354,Monica, Does that sound like Janice?
355,Chandler," If it’s not, then there’s two of them. And that would mean
it’s the end of the world!"
357,Monica, Hey!
358,Ross, Hey!
359,Chandler, Hi.
360,Rachel, Oh hi.
361,Monica, I can’t believe this is taking so long. How are you doing?
362,Rachel," Oh not bad. Do you know that feeling when you’re trying to blow a
Saint Bernard out your ass?"
363,Chandler," Weirdest thing. Did I hear—(A nurse opens the privacy screen and
Chandler sees Janice)—Mother of God it’s true!"
365,Chandler, Jan-Janice!
366,Ross," Not just Janice, Janice in labor, contracting and everything."
368,Chandler," Janice I didn’t even know you were pregnant! Who’s the
unwitting human who’s essence you’ve stolen?"
370,Chandler, What?!
372,Chandler, That’s funny. Does it-does it hurt? Does the labor hurt?
374,Phoebe," Okay I’ve got one for you, if you had too which one would you
rather eat, a seeing eye dog or a talking gorilla?"
376,Phoebe," Somebody went to college. Wow. (Cliff gets uncomfortable) What is it?
I’m sorry. (She moves her arm, which was resting on the same pillow his leg is.)"
378,Phoebe," Oh, I’ll get it. (She gets up and grabs a spoon.)"
380,Phoebe," Relax, it’s not like we’re forking."
382,Rachel," Oh that’s five Ross. Five women have had five babies! And I have
had no babies! Why doesn’t she want to come out?"
383,Ross," Y’know what I think it is? I think you’ve made such a nice home
for her over the last nine months that she just doesn’t want to leave."
384,Rachel," Oh. Look at you making up crap for me. Oh God! (Starts another
contraction as Dr. Long enters.)"
386,Rachel," Doctor you gotta do something! I think you gotta give me drugs or you
gotta light a fire up in there and just smoke it out."
388,Rachel, What?
390,Rachel, My God. Okay. (Another woman enters.) Ha-ha-ha beat ya! Sucker!
393,Phoebe," Y’know what? This one is. (Eats another spoonful of pudding as
Cliff sees something on TV.)"
395,Phoebe," Huh. Okay, Mr. Perkazet."
397,Phoebe," Cliff, do you really believe that a character from a TV show was here in
your room?"
398,Joey," (entering) Rachel’s having her baby!! (Phoebe turns and looks at
him.) Which is of no interest to me, I’m a neurologist."
400,Phoebe," Okay. Okay. I—Okay umm…this…I-I sent my friend Joey in
here to find out stuff about you. Umm y’know, if it helps you came off great. A lot
better than I’m coming off right now."
402,Joey, Fake? Excuse me? Hello? (Taps the TV screen.)
404,Phoebe," You’re right, that was wrong. I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.
It’s just that I liked you so much. Can we just, can we just start over?"
406,Joey," Uh, if I may? Umm-umm look, Cliff, you told me a lot of personal stuff
about you, right? And maybe-maybe it would if-if would help if-if you knew some personal
stuff about her. Uh, she was married to a gay ice dancer. Uh, she gave birth to her
brother’s triplets. Oh! Oh! Her-her twin sister used to do porn!"
407,Phoebe," Uh Joey, we’re trying to dial down the crazy."
408,Joey, Right!
409,Phoebe," Umm, look we don’t, we don’t really know each other so it
would be really easy to just forget about this, but there seems to be something between
us. And I don’t know about you but that doesn’t happen to me a lot."
411,Joey, Me neither.
414,Rachel, 3-2-1 oh!!
416,Rachel," I can’t. I can’t push anymore, I can’t."
417,Ross, Sweetie you’re doing great.
418,Rachel, Oh God twenty seconds my ass!!
420,Ross, What? You do? You do? (Looks) Oh my God!
421,Rachel," Don’t say, ""Oh my God!"" Oh my God what?"
422,Ross, What is that?
424,Ross," Oh thank God, I thought she had two heads."
425,Rachel, Oh God. Is she gonna be okay?
427,Ross, Go!
429,Rachel," I’m sorry, I can’t!"
430,Ross, Yes you can!
431,Rachel, I can’t!
432,Ross, Hey! Hey! Come on! You can! I know you can do this! Let’s go!
433,Rachel," I can’t. Please, you do it for me."
434,Ross," No! Come on let’s—One more time! One final push! Ready?
1…2…3! (Rachel pushes so hard her head snaps up head-butting Ross and knocking
him down.)"
436,Ross, (from the floor) Keep pushing!
437,Rachel, Are you okay?
438,Ross," You have no idea how much this hurts. (All of the women in the room turn
and glare at him.) Keep going! Keep going!"
440,Ross, Oh! Oh! She’s upside down but she’s coming! She’s coming!
441,Rachel, Oh God!
442,Ross, Oh! Oh my God oh! Oh my God she’s here.
444,Ross, Oh she’s…she’s perfect.
445,Rachel," Oh, she’s so tiny. (Starts crying) Where’d she go?"
446,Ross, Oh it’s okay. They’re just-they’re just wrapping her up.
447,Rachel," Okay. Well be careful with her, she’s really tiny."
450,Rachel," Oh hey you. Thanks for coming out of me. (The baby cries.) I know. Oh.
Yeah. Oh, she’s looking at me. Hi! I know you."
452,Rachel," No, not yet."
454,Rachel," Oh no, Baby Girl Geller-Green."
456,Rachel, Hello baby girl.
459,Phoebe, Can we come in?
460,Ross," Oh, come in."
461,Phoebe, Hi!
462,Joey, There she is!
463,Phoebe," Oh, she’s so beautiful."
464,Rachel, Here. (Hands her to Monica.)
465,Monica," Oh my God! She’s amazing. Oh, oh I’m so glad you guys got
drunk and had sex!"
466,Chandler," It’s incredible, I mean one minute she’s inside you and then
47 hours later here she is."
467,Joey," (taking the baby) She looks so real! (The gang looks at him.) Y’know
what I mean! She’s this whole tiny little person. She already has eyelashes and knees
and…uh-oh."
468,Rachel, What?
469,Joey," Oh no-no, no for I second there I counted six fingers, but one was from
the other hand so we’re good."
470,Phoebe," Okay, my turn. My turn. (Joey hands her to Phoebe.) Oh! You’re so
cute! Oh, I could squeeze your little head! (Pause) I won’t."
472,Monica, What’s the matter?
473,Rachel," Oh nothing I… Sorry, I just can’t stop crying."
474,Ross," The doctor says it’s completely normal with all the hormones. Plus,
you-you’re sleep deprived."
475,Rachel," So? You guys are all sleep deprived. I don’t see you weeping
because you put your slippers on the wrong feet. Oh God. (Starts to cry harder.)"
476,Joey, What’s the matter now?
477,Rachel, I was reliving it.
478,Phoebe, Ohhh. (Hands her back to Rachel.)
479,Chandler," So, do you know what you’re gonna call her yet?"
480,Phoebe," Oh, wait a minute it’s not gonna be Baby Girl? I thought that was
so original! "
481,Ross," Uh actually, we-we’ve narrowed it down to two names."
482,Rachel," Yeah, and y’know what? I love them both, so why don’t you just
pick one and that’ll be it."
483,Ross," Wow! Umm, okay uh…everyone…this…is Isabella. (Rachel starts
crying.) What?"
484,Rachel," That’s not her name! I’m sorry, she just doesn’t feel
like an Isabella."
485,Chandler, So then I guess Ferdinad is out.
486,Joey, What was the other one Ross?
487,Ross," Umm, Delilah."
488,Rachel, Oh great! Suddenly she sounds like a biblical whore.
489,Ross," So I guess we’re back to uh, Baby Girl."
490,Phoebe, Yay!
491,Rachel, Well what are we going to do?
492,Monica," It’s okay honey, you’ll find a name."
493,Ross," Ugh, easy for you to say, you already know what your kids names are going
to be."
494,Chandler, You do?
495,Monica," Yeah, I’ve had them picked out since I was fourteen."
496,Chandler," Oh no, it’s gonna be named after some snack or baked good
isn’t it?"
497,Rachel, Well tell us! What are they?
498,Monica," Umm, okay. If it’s a boy it’s Daniel."
499,Rachel, And if it’s a girl?
500,Monica, I don’t want to say.
501,Rachel," Oh, just tell us! We’re not gonna want it!"
502,Monica, Okay. It’s Emma.
503,Rachel," (gasps) Emma! (Looks at the baby and starts to cry.) See? I don’t
want it."
504,Monica, Take it.
505,Rachel, What?
506,Monica, It’s clearly an Emma.
507,Rachel," Oh honey, but you love that name."
508,Monica," Yeah, but I love you more. Besides y’know, nothing goes with Bing.
So I’m screwed. I mean… (Rachel hands Emma to Monica.) Oh, hi Emma. Yeah,
that’s you. You’re our little Em. Oh what’s that honey? What? Oh, you want
a little cousin? (To Chandler) You want a cousin right now?!"
510,Chandler, That was amazing.
511,Monica," I know. Hey, do you realize we may have just changed our lives forever?
We may have just started a family. Nine months from now we can be here, having our own
baby."
512,Chandler," And if not, we got to do it on a bucket."
515,Rachel," Ohhh! (Looks at Aaron and recoils in horror.) Wow! He kinda takes your
breath away doesn’t he?"
517,Rachel," Oh, I’m fine. (Gasps in pain as she sits down.)"
519,Rachel," Oh, I’m not doing it alone. I have Ross."
521,Rachel," Well then he gets a divorce, it’s Ross!"
523,Rachel, Well I—That’s never gonna happen with Ross.
525,Rachel, Really?
527,Rachel," Well… That’s…y’know—That’s—We’ve
been alone for the last twenty minutes we’re doing okay. Besides y’know what?
I-I—Maybe we won’t be alone, ‘cause lately I-I—things have been
happening between me and Ross, y’know? Right before I went into labor, we-we had this
kiss. Y’know? So it might be the…the beginning of something."
528,Ross, (entering) Hey Janice!
530,Ross, Who’s this little guy? (Gasps when he sees Aaron.)
532,Ross, No-no. No.
534,Ross, Okay.
536,Ross, Man! Did you see the kid on that nose?
537,Rachel," Uh-huh. (Ross takes off his coat and sets in on a chair.) Y’know
what I was, I was thinking about?"
538,Ross, Huh?
539,Rachel," Umm…that kiss before we left the apartment. That was some-something
huh?"
540,Ross," Yeah. Yeah, it really was. But we…we gotta be careful. We…we
can’t let that happen again, y’know?"
541,Rachel, (pause) Right.
542,Ross, I mean we don’t want to go down that road do we?
543,Rachel," No! No, of course not. No. That’s why I brought it up. (Pause) They
didn’t have any sodas?"
544,Ross," Oh my God! I’m sorry, I was talking to this nurse, completely forgot."
545,Rachel, That’s all right. (He goes to get her a soda.) And so it begins.
547,Phoebe, Is she in there?
548,Ross," Yeah. She’s putting her down now, that’s her. (Points to the
nurse putting Emma now.)"
549,Phoebe, Oh!
550,Ross, Look at Emma!
551,Phoebe," I just can’t decide who she looks more alike, you or Rachel?"
552,Ross," Oh what are you kidding? She’s gorgeous, it’s all Rachel."
554,Phoebe," I’m sorry, for the last time, why aren’t you two together
again? (Silence from Ross.) No, I know. I know, because you’re not in that place.
Which would be fine, except you totally are."
555,Ross, It’s…it’s complicated okay?
556,Phoebe," Yeah that’s true. Yeah, you love her. You always have. You have a
child together. There is no right answer."
557,Ross," Look, we’ve been together. Okay? And then apart, and then together,
and then apart, and now we have a baby. (Pause) It’s just if-if we got together again
and it didn’t work out…I could never do that to Emma. I mean she-she thinking
everything—(Starts to cry.) Oh that’s…now me. What do they put something in
the water in this place? Since Rachel and I we’re doing really, we’re doing
really well right now."
558,Phoebe," I know. I know. I know. I know, and if you try to make it more you might
wreck it."
559,Ross," Yeah, exactly."
560,Phoebe," Right. (Pause) Or you might get everything you’ve wanted since you
were fifteen."
562,Joey," Hey. I just saw a woman breast feeding both of her twins at the same time;
it is like a freak show up here. (Notices she’s wiping her eyes.) What’s the
matter?"
563,Rachel, Nothing.
564,Joey, What is it? Hey!
565,Rachel, Really it’s nothing. I’m just…
566,Joey," Rach come on, what?"
567,Rachel," I’ve just been thinking about how my baby and I are gonna be all
alone."
568,Joey, What are you talking about alone? What about Ross?
569,Rachel," Oh please, he’ll be with his real family, the twins and little miss
new boobs."
570,Joey," Okay, how long was I watching that woman?"
571,Rachel," I’m just saying that y’know, someday Ross is gonna meet
somebody and…he’s gonna have his own life. Right?"
572,Joey," Yeah, I guess so."
573,Rachel," I just never thought I would raise this baby all by myself. Pretty dumb
huh?"
574,Joey," Hey, listen to me, listen to me…you are never ever gonna be
alone. Okay? I promise that’s not gonna happen."
575,Rachel, Joey. Honey what would I do without you? 
577,Joey, You don’t have to worry about that okay?
579,Rachel," Oh, hon can you grab me my other box of tissues? They’re right on
that chair under Ross’s coat."
580,Joey, Sure.
581,Rachel, Okay.
583,Joey, My God.
584,Rachel, Joey.
586,Rachel, (seeing the ring) Oh my God. (Pause) Okay.
0,Rachel, Joey.
2,Rachel, (seeing the ring) Oh my God. (Pause) Okay.
6,Rachel, So uh…I guess we should…make it official huh?
7,Joey," Uh… Look Rach…(Ross enters.) Hey Ross is here! Hey look!
It’s my good friend Ross. Hey Ross."
8,Ross, Hey Joey. (To Rachel) Hey you.
9,Rachel, Hey you.
10,Joey," Hey and look he brought flowers. Thanks Ross, but I’m really more of
a candy guy. (Laughs.)"
11,Ross," You’re weird today. (He turns to Rachel and Joey puts the ring back.)
(To Rachel) Listen I uh, wanted to talk to you about something."
12,Rachel," Uh yeah, actually I kinda need to talk to you too."
13,Ross," Uh Joey, can you give us just a minute?"
14,Joey, No.
15,Ross, What?
16,Joey," Oh, I’m sorry. I meant no."
17,Monica," (entering with everyone else including Mr. Geller) Hi! Hey look
who’s here!"
19,Chandler, He pulled a quarter out of my ear!
20,Ross," Hey, where’s uh, where’s mom?"
22,Monica," Oh, Aunt Liddy’s coming? That means we get five dollars each!"
24,Chandler, Okay. Wow.
25,Ross," Uh Dad, Emma’s in the nursery. I’ll take you now. If you want,
but (To Rachel) I really want to talk to you."
26,Rachel," I know, I still need to talk to you."
27,Joey," Oh hey but, before you guys do that (To Rachel) I need to talk to you, and
Ross, I need to talk to you."
28,Phoebe, (To Monica) Oh and I need to talk to you.
29,Monica, About what?
30,Phoebe, To see if know what these guys are talking about.
33,Monica, Isn’t she beautiful?
35,Ross, What about Ben?
37,Phoebe," (taking Ross aside) Have umm, have you thought anymore about you and
Rachel?"
38,Ross," Oh well yeah, actually I was going to talk to her when you guys all came
in the room."
39,Phoebe," Yay! It’s so exciting! Wow, you could’ve done that with us
there."
40,Ross, Yeah right.
41,Phoebe," Oh sure okay, you can touch yourself in front of us but you can’t
talk to Rachel."
42,Ross, What?! When have I ever touched myself in front of you guys?
43,Phoebe," Oh please! Just before when you were asleep in the lounge! That Armenian
family was watching you instead of the TV. Oh, that reminds me. That Mr. Hasmeje still has
my Gameboy."
44,Joey," (taking Chandler aside) Hey Chandler, can I talk to you for a second?"
45,Chandler, Sure.
46,Joey, Dude I just did something terrible.
47,Chandler, That was you?! I thought it was Jack!
48,Joey," No! No, that was Jack! Rachel thinks I asked her to marry me!"
49,Chandler, What?! Why does she think that?
50,Joey, Because it kinda looked like I did.
51,Chandler," Again, what?!"
52,Joey," Okay well, I was down on one knee with the ring in my hand…"
53,Chandler, As we all are at some point during the day.
54,Joey," It wasn’t my ring! It fell out of Ross’s jacket! And when I
knelt down to pick it up Rachel thought I was proposing!"
55,Chandler, Ross had a ring?! And he was gonna propose?
56,Joey, I guess.
57,Chandler," And you did it first?! This is gonna kill him! You know how much he
loves to propose!"
58,Joey, I know! I know it’s awful.
59,Chandler," Well, what did she say?"
60,Joey, (happily) She said yes.
61,Chandler, Does Ross know?
62,Joey," Oh God, what the hell am I going to tell him?"
63,Chandler, Well maybe you don’t have to tell him anything.
64,Joey," Oh, I like that. Yeah…"
65,Chandler," If you clear things up with Rachel then Ross never needs to find out,
but you have to do it now before he hears about it and kicks your ass!"
66,Joey," (laughs) Now let’s not get carried away. (He walks away as Monica
comes over and hugs Chandler from behind.)"
67,Monica, I want a baby.
68,Chandler," Honey, we’ve been over this. I need to be facing the other way."
69,Monica," Come on! Come on, if we have sex again it’ll double our chances of
getting pregnant. Do you think that closet’s still available?"
70,Chandler," I’m so tired. (She starts kissing him.) Yeah okay, but no
foreplay."
71,Monica, Deal!
73,Ross, Dad seriously! Y’know you really should see someone about that!
75,Ross," I wanna go talk to Rachel for a minute, are you gonna be okay alone for a
bit?"
77,Ross," (noticing something) Actually umm… (He turns Mr. Geller’s head
to look at Emma.)"
79,Phoebe, Hey!
80,Rachel, Hi.
81,Phoebe, Are you all right?
82,Rachel, Uhh… I think I just got engaged.
83,Phoebe, Oh my God! He did it?
84,Rachel, Well…did you know he was gonna ask me?
85,Phoebe," Are you kidding? I’m like the one who talked him into it. I like to
think of myself as the puppet master of the group."
86,Rachel, And you really think this is a good idea?
87,Phoebe," I just talked him into it, don’t tell me I have to do you too. The
puppet master gets tired people."
88,Rachel, I just don’t know! It just doesn’t feel right.
89,Phoebe," Why?! You two are so meant to be together, everybody thinks so."
90,Rachel, Really?! Even Ross?
91,Phoebe, Especially Ross!
92,Joey," (entering) Oh uh, hey Pheebs. Uh y’know what? I’ll-I’ll
come back later. (He goes to leave but runs into Ross who’s entering.)"
93,Ross," Wow! Kind of uh, kind of a full house here. I’ll guess
just…I’ll come back. (Ross exits followed by Joey.)"
94,Phoebe," There he goes, your fiancée. "
95,Rachel, I guess so.
96,Phoebe, Although he does play with himself in his sleep.
97,Rachel, I can’t say that I’m surprised.
99,Ross," Dad, what are you doing?"
102,Joey," It can’t be me, I’m standing right here."
104,Ross, No!
106,Ross," Y’know what? I don’t like you without mom. (To Joey) Come on.
(Walks away.)"
107,Joey, (To Ross) We’re not peeking? (Follows him.)
109,Chandler," Hello sir, you know Monica."
111,Joey," Hey uh, is it okay to come in?"
112,Rachel," Of course! Oh Joey, this ring I…it’s beautiful I love it!"
113,Joey," Yeah uh look Rach, there’s something I gotta tell ya."
115,Rachel, Hey!
117,Rachel," Yeah! Hi Emma. Hey, why do you think she won’t take my breast?"
119,Joey, (watching) Yowsa! (Looks away.)
120,Rachel," Okay sweetie, you can do it. Just open up and put it in your mouth."
121,Joey, Dear Lord.
122,Rachel," I’m sorry honey, what were you saying?"
123,Joey," Oh uh-uh yeah, I think that…"
124,Rachel," Oh look, she’s pulling away again! Do you think my nipples are too
big for her mouth? (Joey gets embarrassed.) She looks scared. Doesn’t she look
scared?"
125,Joey," Y’know, I don’t really know her."
127,Joey, (To God) Are you kidding me?!
128,Rachel, It’s just so frustrating! Why doesn’t she want my breast?!
129,Joey, I don’t know! Maybe she’s crazy! (Storms out.)
131,Phoebe, Oh hey! Wait up!
132,Ross, Hi!
133,Phoebe," Congratulations! I didn’t want to say anything in front of Joey
‘cause I didn’t know if he knew yet."
134,Ross," What, that we had a baby? Come on let’s give him a little credit,
although, he did eat a piece of plastic fruit earlier."
135,Phoebe," No! No, that you and Rachel are engaged!"
136,Ross, What?
137,Phoebe," Oh, it’s a secret. Oh goodie! Yes! We haven’t done the secret
thing in a long time."
138,Ross," Phoebe, there is no secret. Okay? I didn’t propose."
139,Phoebe," Are you lying? Is this like that time you tried to convince us that you
were a doctor?"
140,Ross," (pause) I am a doctor! Y’know what? I’m just gonna go and
talk to Rachel myself."
141,Phoebe," All right, me too. (They go into her room and see that she’s
sleeping.) Should we wake her up?"
142,Ross," No! No, come on let her sleep! She’s so exhausted."
143,Phoebe, And so engaged. (Points to the ring that Rachel is wearing.)
144,Ross," What? (Motions for Phoebe to go outside with him.) Oh my God! She-she
thinks we’re engaged! Why? Why? Why would she think we’re engaged?!"
145,Phoebe," Perhaps because you gave her an engagement ring? Y’know Ross
doctors are supposed to be smart."
146,Ross, I didn’t give her that ring!
147,Phoebe, Really?
148,Ross, No!
149,Phoebe, So whose ring is it?
150,Ross, It’s mine.
151,Phoebe, Is it an engagement ring?
152,Ross, Yes!
153,Phoebe, But you didn’t give it to her?
154,Ross, No!
155,Phoebe, But you were going to propose?
156,Ross, No!!
157,Phoebe," Huh, I might be losing interest in this."
158,Ross," Look. Look, my mom gave me that ring because she wanted me to propose to
Rachel, but all I wanted to do is if she maybe…kinda…wanted
ah…start…things up again."
159,Phoebe," Oh, what beautiful lukewarm sentiment."
160,Ross," Look, I didn’t want to rush into anything. And it seemed like she
didn’t want to either. But I don’t, I don’t understand how any of this
happened! What? Did she find the ring in my jacket, assume that I was going to propose,
throw it on, and-and just start telling people?"
161,Phoebe," No! No, she said you actually proposed to her."
162,Ross," Well I didn’t! I didn’t propose! (Pause) Unless uh… (Pause)
Did I? I haven’t slept in forty hours and…it does sound like something I would
do."
165,Chandler," Look, we can’t stay in here forever."
166,Monica," Oh, I still can’t believe my dad saw us having sex! He didn’t
make it to one of piano recitals, but this he sees!"
167,Chandler," This is okay. We’re all adults here; there’s nothing to be
ashamed of. Now, let’s put our underwear in our pockets and walk out the door. (They
do so and find Mr. Geller leaning against a wall stunned.)"
168,Monica, Hi Dad! I can still call you that right?
170,Chandler," I just want you to know that what you witnessed in there, that
wasn’t for fun."
171,Monica, It wasn’t fun?!
172,Chandler," (To Monica) Why? Why-why-would you—Wh-why… (To Mr. Geller)
Look, I just don’t want you to think that we’re animals who do it whenever we
want."
174,Monica," The truth is, Dad, we’re-we’re trying."
176,Monica," Yeah, we’re trying to get pregnant."
178,Monica," Well, that’s okay dad, we-we can wait until later."
180,Monica, Daddy?!
182,Chandler," That’s funny, this conversation’s how I got the bullet hole
in my head."
184,Monica," Daddy! I don’t think we need to hear about the specific positions
you and mom had sex."
186,Monica, I don’t feel good right now.
188,Chandler," Seriously sir, my brains? All over the wall."
190,Monica, Hey.
191,Rachel, Hey. I need to tell you something.
192,Monica," Well, now’s a good time. I’m on my way to have my ears cut
off."
193,Rachel, Joey asked me marry him.
194,Monica, What?
195,Rachel, Joey proposed to me.
196,Monica, Is he crazy?! You just had Ross’s baby!
197,Rachel," Well, I-I said yes."
198,Monica," What?! Are you crazy? You just had Ross’s baby! It’s-it’s
so inappropriate. No, it’s worse than that. It’s wrong. It’s… It is
bigger than mine! (Rachel’s engagement ring.)"
199,Rachel," I know. Days of Our Lives, thank you very much."
200,Monica, You can’t marry him!
201,Rachel," Why not? I don’t want to do this alone! And he’s such a sweet
guy and he loves me so much."
202,Monica, Well do you love him?
203,Rachel, Sure.
204,Monica, Sure?
205,Rachel," Yeah, I mean whatever."
206,Monica," Honey, the question is…do you really want to marry Joey?"
207,Rachel," No. No, I don’t. Could you be a dear and go tell him?"
209,Chandler, You still haven’t told Rachel you weren’t really proposing?
210,Joey," No! She had the ring on, she seemed so excited, and then she took her
breast out."
211,Chandler," Joey, you have to tell her what’s going on! And what did it look
like?!"
212,Joey, I didn’t look at it. Stupid baby’s head was blocking most of it.
213,Chandler, Go and tell Rachel right now before Ross finds out.
214,Joey," Look, it’s not that easy. She said she wanted to marry me. I
don’t want to hurt her."
215,Chandler," Okay, look, just do it gently."
216,Joey," You’re right. You’re right. I-I’ll go tell her now before
Ross finds out and I’ll be gentle. I can do that. I am a gentle person. Oh, by the
way. Two people screwing in there (Points to the closet Chandler and Monica were in) if
you want to check that out."
218,Ross, Hey.
219,Rachel, Hey.
220,Ross," Listen, I um… I heard about the engagement."
221,Rachel, Surprised?
222,Ross," And confused. Rach, sweetie, I-I um…I didn’t propose to you."
223,Rachel, I know.
224,Ross, I don’t think you do.
225,Rachel, You didn’t propose to me. Joey did.
226,Ross," Poor baby, you’re so tired. Rach, I didn’t propose to you, Joey
didn’t propose to you, and Chandler didn’t propose to you."
227,Rachel," Uh… You didn’t propose to me, Chandler didn’t propose to
me, but Joey did."
229,Ross, Joey proposed to you?
230,Joey, I can come back.
231,Ross," Hey, wait! Wait-wait-wait! Joey, did you propose to her?"
232,Joey, No.
233,Rachel, Yes you did!
234,Joey," Actually, technically, I didn’t."
235,Rachel, Well then why did you give me a ring?
236,Ross," Wait! Whoa-whoa, you…you gave her the ring?"
237,Joey," No! No, and I did not ask her to marry me!"
238,Rachel," Yes, you did!"
239,Joey," No, I didn’t!"
240,Rachel," Yes, you did!"
241,Joey," No, I didn’t!"
242,Rachel," Yes, you did! And don’t you say, ""No, I didn’t!"""
243,Joey, Ahhh!
244,Rachel, He was right there. He got down on one knee and proposed.
245,Ross, Whoa! You were down on one knee?
246,Joey," Yeah. Yeah, that looks bad. But I didn’t…I didn’t propose!"
247,Ross, Then what did happen?
248,Rachel," Yeah, what did happen?"
249,Joey," Okay, the ring fell on the floor and I went down to pick it up and you
thought I was proposing."
250,Rachel," Yeah, but you said, ""Will you marry me?"""
251,Joey," No, I didn’t!"
252,Rachel," Yes, you did!"
253,Joey," No, I didn’t!"
254,Rachel," Yes, you did—Oh my God you didn’t! (Screams) Well then why
didn’t you tell me that before?!"
255,Joey," Well I tried, but people kept coming in and then you took your breast out!"
256,Ross," Whoa! Hey! Whoa-whoa-whoa, you saw her breast?!"
257,Joey, (To Ross) I’ll tell you about it later. Be cool.
258,Rachel," Well then Joey, what the hell were you doing with an engagement ring?!"
259,Joey," It wasn’t my ring! It’s Ross’s ring! That’s why I felt
so bad Rach, because he was going to propose."
260,Ross, What?!
261,Rachel, You were gonna propose to me?
262,Ross, Uhh… No.
264,Joey," Well, this is awkward. {See? I told you so.}"
265,Ross," But I-I was going to see if y’know, maybe you uh, start dating again
but that—I mean that-that was all, Rach."
266,Joey," Dude, step up! I proposed."
267,Ross," No, you didn’t!"
268,Joey," Oh that’s right. There’s a lot going on here and I think I ate
some bad fruit earlier."
271,Rachel, Okay.
272,Ross, (To Joey) I can’t believe you told her I was going to propose!
273,Joey, I can’t believe you’re not going to propose!
274,Ross," Hey, I’m not going to rush into anything!"
275,Joey," Oh yeah, dude, I totally understand. Usually after I have a baby with a
woman I like to slow things down!"
276,Rachel, Oh my God!
277,Ross, What?
278,Rachel," She’s doing it Look, she’s breast-feeding look!"
279,Joey," (looking at the ceiling) Ah, it’s beautiful."
281,Rachel, Okay.
282,Ross, Thank you. (The nurse exits.)
283,Rachel," Oh wow, this feels weird."
284,Ross, Good weird?
285,Rachel, Wonderful weird.
286,Joey," Y’know what you guys? I’m uh, I’m gonna go too. And uh,
I’m sorry about everything."
287,Rachel," Honey don’t worry, it was my mistake."
288,Joey," No, Rach, I should’ve told you sooner. It’s just that…Man!
That kid is going to town! (Joey makes his awkward exit.)"
289,Rachel, She’s perfect.
290,Ross, We’re so lucky.
291,Rachel, We really are.
292,Ross," Look, I-I know it’s not a proposal and I don’t know where you
are, but with everything that’s been going on and with Emma and…I’ve been
feeling…"
293,Rachel, I know. I know. I’ve feeling…
294,Ross, Yeah?
295,Rachel, Yeah. (Laughs nervously)
296,Ross," Okay, well, that… Wow, okay, well, umm…then maybe, at least we
can, we can talk about us again."
297,Rachel," Yeah, maybe."
298,Ross," Well good, okay. I-I, kind of think y’know if we…if…
You’re wearing the ring."
300,Rachel, Wh-what’s that?
301,Ross, And you told Phoebe you were engaged.
302,Rachel," I’m sorry, what?"
303,Ross, When you thought Joey proposed did…did you say yes?
307,Monica, (walking by with Chandler.) Hey dad!
308,Chandler, Hey.
0,Ross, You said you’d marry Joey?
1,Rachel," Okay you have to realize, I was exhausted, I was emotional, I would have
said yes to anybody. Like that time you and I got married! (Pause) I’m not helping."
2,Ross," So you said yes to him, and you just had our baby?"
3,Rachel," That is right and traditionally the daddy is supposed to give the mummy
a present but I am prepared to let that go."
4,Ross," So when I came in here to see if you wanted to maybe start things up
again, you were engaged to my best friend."
5,Rachel, Well—Really? I thought Chandler was your best friend.
6,Ross," Well, Chandler’s my oldest friend, but Joey’s my—No! Ah!
(points at Rachel)"
7,Rachel, Ooooo!
8,Joey," (Enters) Hey you guys I’m gonna take off. I just wanted to let you
guys know, say goodbye."
9,Ross, Rachel said she’d marry you?!
10,Joey," (He looks around the room) This isn’t the right room, sorry folks.
(leaves)"
13,Monica," Ok, I don’t wanna be negative so I’ll say that most of the
signs you bought are good."
14,Phoebe," No they ran out of ""It’s a girl"" but I can fix this one,
(She writes ""not"" in between it’s and a) See?"
15,Monica," (looking at Chandler sleeping with a balloon in his mouth) So sexy.
(Waking him up.) Honey."
16,Chandler, Yea yea. (Pulls the balloon out of his mouth)
17,Monica, Honey why don’t you go lie down.
18,Chandler," No, no, Ross and Rachel will be back soon and then I gotta go to the
office (Pulls another balloon out of his mouth) Am I producing them?"
19,Joey, Why’re you so tired?
20,Chandler," Couldn’t sleep last night you know, then I started worrying about
this big divisional meeting that I have later today, the more I worried about it the more
I couldn’t sleep.  Y’know? I was like, if I fall asleep now I’ll get
six hours sleep, but if I fall asleep now I’ll get five hours sleep. Not matter what
I did I couldn’t fall asleep."
21,Joey," You know what you should’ve done, you should have told yourself that
little story."
22,Rachel, (enters with Emma) Hi!
24,Monica, Phoebe did the signs!
25,Rachel, Oh you guys thanks for doing this.
26,Phoebe, Look at all the stuff people sent!
27,Rachel," Oh Ah! (Sees a big stuffed gorilla) Oh my gosh there’s something
every mother needs, a giant stuffed gorilla that takes up the entire apartment! What are
people think… (Reads the card) Oh you guys I love it."
28,Joey, Hey so where’s Ross?
29,Rachel, He’s downstairs getting the rest of the stuff out of the cab.
30,Joey, Is he still mad at us?
31,Rachel," Well, you more then me, but he can’t stay to mad at me. I mean, I
just had his baby."
32,Joey, That’s not fair! I can’t do that.
33,Rachel," Yeah, I’m not so sure you should be here when he comes up."
34,Joey," See this is what I was afraid of, I didn’t think I should be here
either but somebody (Looks at Chandler) said he’d be over it by now."
35,Chandler," Hey, what do I know? I wanted to get a bigger gorilla."
41,Chandler, Walter (nods).
43,Phoebe," She’s just so cute! I just wanna bite her ear off and use it and a
sucking candy."
44,Monica," Phoebe! But I could take one of those little feet and put it in a pita
pocket."
45,Ross, (enters from the bed room) Okay I put most of the stuff away.
46,Rachel," Oh great, the pacifiers?"
47,Ross, In the closet.
48,Rachel, The burping clogs?
49,Ross, Linen closet.
50,Rachel, The diapers?
51,Ross, In the hospital.
52,Phoebe, Wow you guys got a hospital?  Fancy!
53,Ross," No I left the diapers at the hospital! There’s some in the bag but
I’ll run out and get some more."
54,Rachel," Alright thanks, oh Ross could you stop by the coffee house and get me a
muffin?"
55,Ross, Sure what kind?
56,Rachel," Umm let me think...What do I want, what d-o I w-a-n-t..."
57,Ross," Please take your time, it’s an important decision. Not like, say, I
know! deciding to marry someone, this is about a muffin."
58,Rachel, Blueberry.
59,Ross, Blueberry it is.
60,Rachel, Thanks.
61,Monica," Wow, he’s really not letting this go, is he?"
62,Rachel, God how long do you think that’s gonna last?
63,Phoebe," I dunno, well he got over the ""We were on a break"" thing
really quickly."
64,Rachel," Y’know I can’t even worry about that right now, cause I got
the cutie little baby, oh I can’t believe how much I love her, I can’t get
enough of her, like right now I miss her.  I actually miss her."
65,Phoebe, You know that’s… that’s her.
66,Rachel," Oh god look at her sleeping.  Oh, I love her so much!  Oh, I
think I’m gonna wake her up."
67,Phoebe," Oh no, Rach, no no, you know you’re never supposed
to wake a sleeping baby."
68,Rachel," Well I can do whatever I want!  I made her! (Waking Emma up.) Come
on little girl, hi!"
70,Phoebe, I can say I told you so but she’s kinda doing that for me.
71,Rachel," Oh I’m sorry mummy’s so sorry go back to sleep go back to
sleep. Shh.   Shhh! Go back to sleep"
73,Monica, Breaks your heart doesn’t it
74,Phoebe, It really does… how long do you think we have to stay?
77,Chandler, Yep.
79,Chandler, (not knowing what he’s saying yes to) Yes.
83,Phoebe," Well, alright, we already tried feeding her, changing her, burping her,
oh try this one! Go back in time and listen to Phoebe!"
84,Monica," Alright here’s something, it says to try holding the baby close to
your body and then swing her rapidly from side to side."
85,Rachel, Ok. (Starts swinging Emma rapidly and she stops crying)
86,Monica, It worked!
87,Rachel," Oh (happy) oh no just stopped to throw up a little bit. (Emma starts
crying again.) Oh come on, what am I gonna do, its been hours and it won’t stop
crying."
88,Monica," Umm, she Rach, not it, she. "
89,Rachel," Yeah, I’m not so sure."
90,Monica," Oh my god, I am losing my mind."
91,Phoebe," Yeah, no kidding, this just proves no good can come from having sex with
Ross!"
93,Ross," Hey Gunther, can I get a couple of blueberry muffins to go? (He puts a bag
with diapers in it on the counter.)"
95,Ross, Yep.
97,Ross," Yep, can you believe it?"
99,Ross, Huh? Ooh (laughs) you mean like a… Huh?
100,Joey," (entering) Hey. (Ross turns to see who it is, and seeing it’s Joey he
just ignores him and turns back around.) Ross, I know you’re pissed at me, but we
have to talk about this."
101,Ross, Ah actually we don’t. (Ross walks off) 
102,Joey,"  Fine, fine okay.  But I gotta say technically, I
didn’t even do anything wrong."
103,Ross, (turns back) What! (Angrily) You didn’t do anything wrong?!
104,Joey, I said I didn’t technically.
105,Ross," Okay let’s put aside that you (Makes quote marks with his fingers.)
""accidentally"" picked up my grandmothers ring and you (Does it again)
""accidentally"" proposed to Rachel."
106,Joey," Look, can I just stop you right there for a second? When people do this
(Makes quote marks with his fingers.) I don’t really know what that means. (Ross just
looks at him) You were saying?"
107,Ross," And I can even understand that you couldn’t tell Rachel, but why
couldn’t you tell me, huh? You had all day to and you didn’t."
108,Joey," I know I should’ve. (Makes quote marks again.) ""I’m
sorry."" "
109,Ross," Not using it right, Joe."
111,Ross, I’m gonna go.
112,Joey," No, come on Ross! (He grabs his bag so he can’t leave) Look, Ross, we
have to get past this."
113,Ross, Give me the bag.
114,Joey," No, look, I don’t know what else to do. I said I’m sorry!"
115,Ross, Joey!
116,Joey," You should scream at me, or-or-or curse me, or hit me."
117,Ross, I’m not gonna hit you.
118,Joey," Why not?  You’ll feel better!  I’ll feel better, and
you know you want to. I can see it in your eyes."
119,Ross, No I don’t.
120,Joey, A little bit.
121,Ross, No.
122,Joey, Little bit.
123,Ross, No!
124,Joey, (excited) A little bit more.
125,Ross, Give me the bag.
126,Joey," No, hit me"
127,Ross, Give me the bag.
128,Joey, Hit me.
129,Ross," Joey, give me the bag."
130,Joey, Hit me!
131,Ross, Joe I’m not kidding…
132,Joey," (interrupting) Hit me, hit me."
133,Ross, No!
134,Joey, (shouts) Hit me! Hit me! 
136,Ross, You ducked!!
137,Joey, I’m sorry! It was a reflex! 
138,Ross," Oh my god, this really hurts!!!"
139,Joey," I couldn’t help it! When a fist comes at your face, you duck! Look!
(He goes to punch Ross, expecting him to duck, but he doesn’t and Joey punches Ross.
  Gunther is amused.)"
140,Ross, What is the matter with you?!?
141,Joey, You were supposed to duck!!! Why didn’t you duck?
142,Ross, Why don’t we talk about this on the way to the hospital?
143,Joey," Good, good yeah, (Grabs the bags) maybe while we’re there, they can
check your reflexes. (Joey opens the door and it hits Ross in the face with it.) (Makes
quote marks.) ""Oops."""
146,Monica, Try feeding her again.
147,Rachel, I already fed her.
148,Monica," I know, that’s why I said again!"
149,Phoebe," Alright you guys, we can’t turn on each other, Okay? 
That’s just what she wants."
150,Chandler, (enters) Hey.
151,Monica, Hey.
152,Chandler, Monica can I talk to you outside for a minute?
153,Rachel," Oh no, you guys, just stay here, I’m gonna go check her diaper,
Pheebs you wanna come?"
154,Phoebe, Oh I’m kinda part of this.
155,Chandler, Actually Pheebs its more of a husband and wife kinda thing
156,Phoebe, I knew I should have married Chandler.
158,Monica, Okay what’s up
159,Chandler," Umm, you know how we always said that it would be fun to move to Paris
for a year? You know, you could study French cooking and I could write and we could take a
picnic along the Seine and go wine tasting in Bordeaux?"
160,Monica, Oh yeah (smiles).
161,Chandler," Okay, you know how that people say that Tulsa is the Paris of
Oklahoma?"
162,Monica, What? Who says that?
163,Chandler, People who’ve never ever been to Paris.
164,Monica, What’s going on?
165,Chandler, We’re moving to Tulsa! (Makes a excited expression on his face)
166,Monica, Excuse me?
167,Chandler," Okay, Ms. McKenna, she kind of works above my boss, she asked me to
move to Tulsa and be the president of our office there, and I was sleeping and apparently,
said yes."
168,Monica," (stands up angry) Tulsa, Oklahoma!"
169,Chandler," The Sooner State, whatever that is."
170,Monica," Chandler, I don’t even wanna see the musical Oklahoma!"
171,Chandler," Really? Oh What A Beautiful Morning!  Surrey With A
Fringe On Top."
172,Monica," Are you trying to tell me that we’re moving to Oklahoma, or that
you’re gay? All right, not that this matters, but did they at least offer you a huge
raise?"
173,Chandler," No, no, but they are going to lease us a Ford Focus. (Monica’s
not impressed.) I’ll get out of it."
174,Monica, Thank you.
175,Chandler, (hears Emma crying) What is wrong with Emma?
176,Monica," Oh she misunderstood, she thought she was moving to Tulsa."
178,Chandler," Umm ma’am, do you have a minute? (She points for him to come in)
I kind of have some bad news. I don’t think I can move to Tulsa."
180,Chandler," It’s a funny story, actually. (coughs) I kind of fell asleep in
the meeting this morning so when I said I’d move to Tulsa, I didn’t really know
what I was saying."
182,Chandler," But only because I was up all night worried about this meeting,
ain’t that funny? Irony? Not a fan, alright (he sits down). See, here’s the
thing. I went home and told my wife about Tulsa and she won’t go. See, me, I love
Tulsa!  Tulsa is heaven!  Tulsa is Italy—Please don’t make me go
there!"
184,Chandler," No no no! Look, Carol, can I call you Carol? (Pause) Wh-why would I
when your name is Elaine? Oh what a great picture of your son, strapping! (She glares at
him.) That’s a picture of your daughter, isn’t it, well she’s lovely. I
like a girl with a strong jaw. I’ll call you from Tulsa. (Exits.)"
186,Joey," Hey, so how is it?"
187,Ross, I broke my thumb.
188,Joey," Your thumb? That’s weird. (Makes a fist.) You sure you’re
punching right? Make a fist. (Ross just looks at him with his thumb in a cast.) Maybe
later. Ross I feel terrible."
189,Ross," You know what, you can go, I just have to fill out some forms. (Tries to
hold the pen but can’t)"
190,Joey," You, you want me to help you with that?"
191,Ross," Why, does it look like I’m having trouble with my misshapen claw? (He
hands Joey the form)"
192,Joey," Name? (Ross looks at him.) I know Ross but what’s it short for? You
know like, like Rossel or Rosstepher."
193,Ross, Just Ross!
194,Joey," It’s pretty, Okay date of birth?"
195,Ross, You know my birthday.
196,Joey," Sure, May...tember."
197,Ross, October 18th.
198,Joey, Occupation? Dinosaurs.
199,Ross," Actually I’m a palian… Dinosaurs is fine… the drawing is
not."
200,Joey," Alright, who do you want as your emergency contact?"
201,Ross," Ah, Rachel I guess."
202,Joey," Okay, relationship, boy this could take a while."
203,Ross, Just ah… just put roommate.
204,Joey," Come on, you guys are more then that! I mean, you’re gonna get
together right?"
205,Ross, I don’t think that we are.
206,Joey, But you two were supposed to be together.
207,Ross," Well, I thought so too, but then she said she’d marry you."
208,Joey," Come on, Ross, that didn’t mean anything! She just had the baby, she
was all freaked out about doing it alone, she would have said yes to anybody."
209,Ross, Yeah that’s what she said.
210,Joey, So?
211,Ross, So I don’t wanna be just anybody.
212,Joey, Wow.
213,Ross," You know what, it’s, it’s better this way anyway. I mean I
don’t know what I was thinking, going down that road again with us. It’s just
much easier if we’re just friends who have a kid."
214,Joey, Really?
215,Ross, Yeah.
216,Joey, And you’re Okay with that?
217,Ross," Yes. I mean, it’s what we always planned.  And if you have a
plan, you should stick to it.  That’s why they call them plans.  Hello?
(Pause) I’m fine."
218,Joey," Hey, for what it’s worth, with Rachel I don’t think you’ll
ever be just (Makes quote marks.) ""anybody."""
219,Ross, Hey there you go! (Smiles because Joey used it correctly)
220,Joey," (makes quote marks) ""Thanks."""
223,Rachel, Oh my God! How long has she been crying?
224,Monica, About a week and a half.
225,Phoebe," Well alright, looks like you guys have got it under control so I’m
just gonna go. (She gets up and Rachel looks at her, upset, and Monica just stares.) No!
Really? Misery really does love company. All right! (She sits back down.)"
226,Monica," Rach, try holding her a different way."
227,Rachel," You guys, I’m doing the best I can, anyone else is welcome to try."
228,Phoebe," Alright, I’ll try, fine! Yes, Okay!"
229,Rachel, Here you go. (Hands Emma to Phoebe)
230,Phoebe, Shh! Nothing works with this child! (Hands her back.)
231,Rachel," Oh god what am I gonna do you guys, I can’t even comfort my own
baby! I’m the worst mother ever!"
232,Monica," You’re just new at this, it’ll get better, think about your
first day at work. I mean, that couldn’t have been easy but you figured that out."
233,Rachel," Yeah I don’t think dressing provocatively is going to help me here!
Oh my god just please take her."
234,Monica," Okay I’ll take her, here. (Takes Emma)"
235,Rachel, I have to go to the bathroom. (Goes to the bathroom)
236,Phoebe, I have to go scream into a pillow. (Goes to scream into a pillow)
237,Monica," (To Emma) Bouncy baby, Bouncy baby, Ooh baby baby, Ooh baby baby, Ooh
baby baby. (Emma stops crying and falls asleep)"
238,Phoebe, (entering) Have I gone deaf?
239,Monica," It worked! Ooh baby baby baby, ooh baby baby baby!"
240,Phoebe, You must be a fireball in bed.
241,Monica," I can’t believe it!  She’s asleep!  I got her to go
to sleep!   I have actual magical powers!"
242,Phoebe," I can hear traffic and birds!  I can hear the voices in my head
again! (Monica looks at her strangely) I’m kidding. (She smiles wickedly.)"
243,Rachel, Oh my God! You got her to stop crying!
244,Monica," Yes I did, I’m Monica, Super Aunt"
245,Rachel, You are the official baby crier stopper!
246,Monica, Yes I am!!
247,Rachel, You’re never leaving the apartment!
248,Monica, Say what?
249,Rachel," That’s your new job, day and night, she starts crying I need you
here."
250,Monica, (stands up to hand Emma back) Oh no no no no!
251,Phoebe," Thankfully you don’t need me at all (gets up and to leave) so Okay
Super aunt see you later! Rachel let’s give it six to eight months (she leaves)."
252,Rachel, Okay so listen I’m gonna go lay down.
253,Monica, What?
254,Rachel," You know the book says that whenever she’s sleeping I should be
sleeping so… (She gives Monica thumbs and goes to lay down)"
255,Chandler," (entering, loudly) Hey!"
256,Monica, Shhh! We just got her to go to sleep
257,Chandler, Oh so there can’t be any yelling.
258,Monica, No.
259,Chandler, We’re moving to Tulsa
260,Monica, (loudly) What!?
261,Chandler," Shhhh! Shhhhh! Shhhhh! Shhhhh! (Walks backwards towards the door) I
can’t, I can’t hear you. (He runs out)"
263,Ross, Hey.
264,Rachel," Heeeeey, where have you been? (He shows her his thumb) What happened to
you?"
265,Ross," Ah I had a little thing with Joey, if you think this is bad you should see
him."
266,Rachel," Oh no Ross! This is not good, we have to talk about this Joey thing.
Please sit. (He sits) You have got to get over this Joey thing, okay? I never really
wanted to marry Joey, okay?"
267,Ross, Okay.
268,Rachel, You know what I really really want?
269,Ross," What, Rach?"
270,Rachel," I wanna sleep, I wanna eat, I wanna take a shower, I mean before she
wakes up and we gotta do this all over again."
271,Ross, (smiles) Right.
272,Rachel," I mean I got news for you mister, Emma?  Not easy."
273,Ross," Well, that’s what I’m here for. (Emma starts crying again) Want
me to get that?"
274,Rachel, No its really okay… Monica!
275,Monica," (comes running out the kitchen to the bedroom) Got it! Got it! Got it!
Got it! Got it! Got it!"
278,Joey," You know, ah, I’ve been thinking about this and I gotta tell ya,
it’s not my fault. It’s a natural instinct."
279,Chandler," (enters) Hey, what you guys talking about?"
280,Joey," Hey OK great, what would you do if I did this? (Swings to punch Chandler,
he moves and he ends up punching Ross, knocking him off the stool. Ross then gets up and
just stares at Joey.)"
2,Rachel, Hi!
3,Ross," Hey! So what's the big news you had us rush all the
  way over here for?"
4,Chandler," Okay, our news. My company has asked me to head
  up our office in Tulsa , so as of Monday I'm being officially relocated."
5,Ross, Oh my God!
6,Phoebe, What?!
7,Rachel, What?!
8,Ross, Monday?!
9,Joey, How long do you have to go for?
10,Chandler, They said it could be up to a year.
11,Joey, A year?!
12,Rachel, (To Monica) Do you have to go?
13,Monica," I kind of have to don't I? Because of this stupid
  thing (Points to her wedding ring.)"
14,Chandler," There is nothing like the support of your loving
  wife, huh?"
15,Joey," Wait a minute, you can't go to Tulsa. Maybe you forgot,
  but we've got tickets to the Jets game next week."
16,Chandler," I'm sorry buddy, but I don't think I'm gonna be
  able to make it."
17,Joey, We were gonna go see the Jets!
18,Ross," You can't go, I mean you're the glue that holds this
  group together!"
19,Chandler, Really?
20,Ross, Not you.
21,Joey, I can't believe you guys are moving.
22,Phoebe, I call their apartment!!!
26,Joey, Here you are (Hands Rachel a cup of coffee)
27,Rachel," Thank you Joey. You know what? I'm not even sure
  I can have caffeine."
28,Ross," I went thru this with Ben and Carol. One cup of coffee
  won't affect your milk."
29,Rachel, Yeah. Just to be sure I'm gonna call Dr. Wiener. 
30,Joey, (Laughs)
31,Rachel," Every time? (She takes up her cell phone and starts
  dialing.)"
32,Joey, Uhuh.
33,Ross," Rach, you don't have to call whenever you have a little
  question, okay? Trust me, I know this."
34,Rachel," All right, I trust you. (Continues to dial)"
35,Ross," Rachel, I can see you dialing! I don't understand why..."
36,Rachel," I'm on the phone! (On the phone) Dr. Wiener? (Ross
  and Rachel walk away)"
37,Joey, (Laughs)
38,Phoebe," It's so weird seeing Ross and Rachel with a baby.
  It's just so grown up."
39,Joey," I know, yeah. I feel like we're all growing up. Person
  named Wiener, God that kills me. (Laughs)"
40,Phoebe, Look at you all grown up.
41,Joey," Actually, you know what? I am. That whole thing with
  Rachel made me realize that maybe I'm ready for a more serious relationship.
  You know? Like I'd like to meet a nice mature commitment-minded lady. And looks
  aren't as important as...Nah, she's gotta be hot."
42,Phoebe," You know, I might know somebody. Hey, how about you
  set me up with someone, and we double date!"
43,Joey," I can do that, yeah. How is Friday?"
44,Phoebe," Done. Oh good, really?"
45,Joey, Yeah! 
46,Phoebe," Let's see! (Opens her address book.) Oh, you know
  who's great? Sandy Poophack. "
47,Joey, (Laughs) Poophack... (Laughs)
48,Phoebe," Yeah... All right, well that rules out Lana Titweiller"
49,Joey, (Laughs)
51,Chandler, (Enters) Hey!
52,Monica, Hey!
53,Chandler, I've got good news!
54,Monica, You got out of the whole Tulsa thing?
55,Chandler," Okay, I have news. You don't have to move to Tulsa.
  You can stay here and keep your job. "
56,Monica, It's great! How?
58,Monica," So you're gonna be gone four days a week? (Thinks
  about it.) No."
59,Chandler," I'm sorry, are you just used to saying that?"
60,Monica, No. I can't be away from you for that long.
61,Chandler, Really?
62,Monica," Yeah, you're my husband. I'm not gonna live in a
  different state than you for 208 days out of the year."
63,Chandler, That's fast math! We could use you in Tulsa. 
64,Monica," Honey, thanks for trying to figure out a way, but
  if you're going to Tulsa, I wanna go with you."
65,Chandler," Hey, you said that without gagging!"
66,Monica, I know! (They high-five.) 
68,Rachel," (On the phone) Excuse me? Oh yeah? Well, up yours
too! (Hangs up)"
69,Ross, (Enters from his bedroom)Who the hell was that?!
70,Rachel, Dr. Wiener. 
71,Ross," Rach, you can't call people at three in the morning. "
72,Rachel," Oh you know what, you sound just like his wife!"
73,Ross, Was there anything you did wrong with Emma?
74,Rachel," Yes, of course there is! Okay? I'm not insane!"
75,Ross," Well, what was it?"
76,Rachel, Hiccups.
77,Ross," Rach, I told you, you can't call him every time any
  little thing comes up. "
78,Rachel," Yeah well, not anymore I can't. He fired us! What
  are we gonna do? We have to find a pediatrician. Wait wait, Monica said that
  when you guys were growing up, you really liked your doctor. What was his name?"
79,Ross," Dr. Gettleman? Yeah I know, I don't think that's a
  good idea. In fact, I think he's dead."
80,Rachel, Argh! Why does everything happen to me?!
81,Ross," Rach, I promise first thing tomorrow we'll find another
  doctor, but I gotta get up early and I'm not feeling all that well."
82,Rachel," What? What, do you mean you're not feeling well?
  What do you have? Is it Rubella? Because don't go near Emma, she has not had
  that shot."
83,Ross," You know? Come to think of it, it does feel Rubella-like!
  (Walks back into his room.)"
84,Rachel," (Grabs the phone and stars dialing) (On phone) (In
  a high pitch voice) Wiener, Wiener (In a low pitch voice) Wiener, Wiener!!!"
85,Ross, (Comes back into the living room) Rachel!!!
86,Rachel, Great! Now he's gonna know it was me!
88,Phoebe, (Enters) Hey!
89,Joey, Hey!
90,Phoebe," So how is this for our big double date tonight? (She
  is all dressed up)"
91,Joey," (Realizes that he has forgotten all about the double
  date) Oh my God!"
92,Phoebe," Ooh, great! Just the reaction I was hoping for. "
93,Joey," Yeah, so you found someone for me. You didn't forget? "
94,Phoebe," Of course not! And you're gonna love Mary Ellen.
  She's really smart and cute and funny, and I can't tell you how I know this,
  but she' not opposed to threesomes. So tell me some about my guy. "
95,Joey, No.
96,Phoebe," Come on, give me something. What's his name?"
97,Joey, Mike.
98,Phoebe, Mike? Okay! What's his last name?
99,Joey, Damnit! Is there no mystery left in romance anymore!?
100,Phoebe," All right, we'll se you and Mike at the restaurant
  in a couple hours."
102,Joey," Why did I have to say Mike? I don't know a Mike! Why
  couldn't I have said... (Looks through his address book) There's no guy in
  there! "
104,Rachel," It's impossible to find a good doctor. I mean, how
  do you know the good ones from the ones who are gonna push their penis against
  your knee?"
105,Monica, Excuse me?
106,Chandler, I know what she's talking about.
107,Rachel," We've got to find a new pediatrician. Ross was getting
  sick last night, and I think Emma may have caught it."
108,Monica, Why don't you go see Dr. Gettleman? 
109,Rachel, Ross said he died. 
110,Monica," He didn't die. I saw his daughter last week. Said
  he was fine. Her on the other hand, botched Botox."
111,Rachel," Oh, great! Well, then I'm gonna take Emma to see
  him. I wonder why Ross said that he died."
112,Monica," Oh, maybe he was getting him confused with his childhood
  therapist."
113,Chandler, He saw a therapist?
114,Monica," Yeah, he used to have this recurring nightmare, just
  really freaked him out."
115,Rachel, Why? What was it?
116,Monica, That I was going to eat him.
119,Joey, MIKE!!!
121,Joey," (Checks him out) Okay! (Walks over to his table and
  sits down with him)"
124,Joey," Everything is gonna be fine. Just follow my lead, okay?
  All you have to do is pretend to be Mike."
126,Joey, Atta boy!
128,Joey," Okay, look..."
130,Phoebe," Joey, this is Mary Ellen Jenkins. So, Mike, how do
  you and Joey know each other anyway?"
132,Joey, (Laughs) From school.
134,Phoebe," Wow, you guys go way back then. So what are you up
  to these days?"
136,Joey," Mike, 'attorney at law'!"
138,Joey, What? That's the kinda thing you usually run by me.
140,Phoebe," Wow, that's great! I liked that better than the law
  thing, so..."
141,Joey," Which is why I waited until now to introduce you to
  Mike."
143,Joey," No, no, that's not what I meant. Let's get you a cocktail."
146,Monica, Hey!
147,Chandler, Hey!
148,Monica, What are you doing?
149,Chandler, Looking for restaurant jobs for you in Tulsa.
150,Monica, That's so sweet. Find anything?
151,Chandler, Slim Pickings.
152,Monica," Nothing, huh?"
153,Chandler," No, 'Slim Pickings', it's a barbecue restaurant.
  They're looking for a cook. Actually 'cook' may be a bit of a stretch. They're
  looking for someone to shovel mesquite. "
154,Monica, 'Slim Pickings'...That is so cheesy.
155,Chandler, 'So Cheesy' also has an opening.
156,Monica," Honey, that's okay. I actually know this woman, Nancy,
  who's a restaurant biz head-hunter. Maybe she'll know of something."
157,Chandler," Can I just say how much I appreciate you coming
  with me. When we get to Tulsa I'm taking you for a great dinner at 'Slim Pickings'.
  'So Cheesy'? 'Whole Hog'? It's going to be tough to keep Kosher in Tulsa."
158,Monica," (On phone) Hi, Nancy. Hi, it's Monica Geller. I'm
  good. Listen, I'm looking for a job in Tulsa. Well yeah, my husband has been
  relocated...Because I love him! No, I don't want a job in New York. Javo (sp?)
  is looking? Oh my God! He asked for me personally? Oh my God! Oh, wow, this
  is really flattering, but I'm moving to Tulsa. Yeah, so if you would tell Javo
  (sp?) 'I'll take it!'"
160,Rachel," Hi, my name is Rachel Green, I have an appointment
  for Emma."
163,Ross, Thanks doctor.
165,Ross," You even have to ask?! (He grabs a lollypop out of
  a jar) (Sees Rachel) (To Rachel) He is alive!"
167,Phoebe," You know, it's so surprising that you and Joey have
  known each other for so long and I've never heard about you."
168,Joey," Yeah, that's because we had a bit of a falling out.
  Mike hit my mom with a car."
170,Joey," That's okay Mike, I have forgiven you. And now we're
  friends again everything's great!"
172,Joey," Please, we're trying to have a conversation. (Pushes
  the wine glass closer to Mary Ellen.)"
175,Phoebe, What?!
177,Joey, What?!
178,Phoebe, Do you not know each other?
179,Joey," (Laughs) Of course we do! Mike is playing a game that
  we used to play in high school. Yeah, where we pretend we don't know each other.
  We played all kinds of games. (To Mike) Hey, remember the one where I punch
  you in the face for not being cool?!"
180,Phoebe," Mike, let me ask you something. How many sisters
  does Joey have?"
182,Joey," What are you doing? I said seven! (Holds up six fingers.)
  (Realizes his mistake) Argh!!!"
183,Phoebe," Joey, why did you set me up with a stranger?"
184,Joey," Because I forgot about our date, I'm so sorry."
186,Phoebe," (To Joey) You are unbelievable! I spent so much time
  finding the perfect girl for you, you know. Mary Ellen is really smart and
  cute and loose."
188,Phoebe," Who are you kidding? (To Joey) You just find some
  guy off the street for me? Oh God! This is humiliating!"
189,Joey," Look Phoebe I'm so sorry! Hey, look, if you don't like
  this guy I can find you a better one. (Looks around) Mike!! Mike!!"
190,Phoebe, I'm out of here (She leaves)
192,Joey, (To Mary Ellen) You're leaving too?
194,Joey, Good night! 
196,Chandler," Honey, we're leaving tomorrow you've still got
  a lot of packing to do."
197,Monica, You're right. (Pause) Maybe I shouldn't go.
198,Chandler, What?
199,Monica," So Nancy told me about this job at this great restaurant,
  Javo (sp?). It's just a little outside of Tulsa."
200,Chandler, How far outside?
201,Monica, Manhattan.
202,Chandler," And you're thinking of taking it? (Pause) So before
  you said being me with me was more important than any job, but I guess now
  it's old job, (Raises his hand) me, (Raises his hand) new job. "
203,Monica," I'm gonna miss this hand! Okay I know it's a lot
  to ask, but oh my God Chandler, this is a once in a lifetime opportunity."
204,Chandler," What happened to 'you can't live without me four
  days a week'?"
205,Monica," Well, if you really think about it, I mean four days
  is not that long. I mean, I see you Monday before you go to work, and I see
  you Thursday when you get back, and I always work late on Tuesdays, so really
  if you think about it, it's really just one day. And well, if we can't make
  it one day, we've got real problems my friend."
206,Chandler, I think you should take the job.
207,Monica, Really?
208,Chandler," Yeah. I know it must be important to you when you
  start chattering like a monkey."
209,Monica, That's the nicest anyone has ever said to me!
211,Ross, Hey!
212,Monica, How was the pediatrician?
213,Rachel," Oh, I really liked him. (Looks at Ross) Yeah, it
  was really, really, really good."
214,Ross, You promised you wouldn't say anything.
215,Rachel," I know. (Pause) Ross still sees his pediatrician!!!
  (To Ross) I don't care!"
216,Monica, Are you serious? You still see Dr. Gettleman?
217,Ross, He's a brilliant diagnostician!
218,Chandler, Diagnostician or boo-boo fixer?
219,Rachel," Ross, seriously! You've gotta go to an appropriate
  doctor."
220,Ross," Why? Why? I know it's a little weird, but hey, he's
  a great doctor, okay? He knows my medical history, and every time I go in there,
  he makes a big deal. 'Ah look, it's my favorite patient!'"
221,Chandler," Does he say that before he sticks his thermometer
  in your touchy?"
222,Ross," Hey, I seem to remember someone bringing his security
  blanket to college!"
223,Chandler, That was not a security blanket! That was a wall-hanging!
224,Ross, It didn't spend much time on the wall!!!
227,Phoebe, Sure.
229,Phoebe, Why did you go along with that?
231,Phoebe," That's true. (Pause) Well, is anything you told me
  about yourself true?"
233,Phoebe, Prove it.
235,Phoebe, That wouldn't stand in the way of a true pianist.
237,Phoebe, You are really good! I play a little guitar myself.
239,Phoebe, Uhuh.
241,Phoebe," Well, like acoustic folksy stuff. You know? But right
  now I'm working on a couple 'Iron Maiden' covers. "
243,Phoebe," It's okay. Go ahead, ask me out."
245,Joey, (Walks In)
246,Phoebe," (To Mike) Oh, you just caught me off guard! Yeah,
  that would be nice."
247,Joey, Look at this. My two best friends!
250,Ross," Excuse me, I don't mean to be a jerk, but the baby
  with the rash came in after me."
253,Ross, With the circus? He's behind the elephant.
255,Ross," Yeah, that's how I know. I'm Ross by the way."
257,Ross, I am a single parent.
259,Ross," Well, let's say, I don't know, you met someone in the
  pediatrician's office."
261,Ross," Hmm, yeah. (To a random boy in the waiting room) Come
  on Ross jr. It's time to go in."
264,Ross," Hey, I helped you find Waldo! "
266,Ross," (Enters) Oh good, you haven't left yet."
267,Monica, Where have you been?
268,Ross," I got held up at Dr. Gettleman's office. There was
  some guy that freaked everybody out."
269,Chandler," Well, you got here just in time. I really have
  to go buddy. (They hug)"
270,Ross, Oh man.
271,Monica, Promise to call me when you land.
272,Chandler, Of course I will call you. I love you.
273,Monica, I love you too. (They kiss)
274,Rachel," Okay, wow, wow, wow. Watch the tongue people, we've
  got a baby over here."
275,Phoebe, Bye Chandler.
276,Chandler, Awww. (They hug) Bye!
277,Rachel, Bye honey. (They hug)
278,Chandler," (Tries to hug Joey but J. moves away) What's the
  matter Joe?"
279,Joey," I'm mad at you for leaving! You're nothing but a big
  leaver. Big leaver with a stupid suitcase."
280,Chandler," Any chance you are trying to pick a fight to make
  all this easier?"
281,Joey," Dude, you see right thru me!! (They hug) (Joey heads
  for the door and pushes Chandler's suitcase on the way out.)"
282,Chandler," Well, bye Mon, bye Ross, Rachel, bye Emma!"
283,Phoebe," Okay, bye-bye! (Pushes Chandler out the door.) Good
  trip! (Slams the door)"
284,Monica," (Runs out to the hallway) Chandler, wait. It goes
  Old job, (Raises her hand) new job, (Raises her hand really high) you. This
  is just something I have to do."
285,Chandler, I know.
286,Monica, I love you so much.
287,Chandler, I know that too. (They kiss)
290,Chandler," (On cell phone) Don't worry, I'll be back before
  you know it. Yes it will be the same. Because I know, that's how. I promise."
292,Joey," (On the phone with Chandler) Double promise? Call me
  when you land."
293,Monica, Can I talk now?
294,Joey," Okay, bye. (He hangs up the phone.)"
295,Monica, Joey?
296,Joey, He had to board. 
0,Phoebe," Oh hey Ross oh I'm so glad someone's here could
  you zip me up?"
1,Ross, sure.
2,Phoebe," Thank you. Can you believe no-one between my apartment
  and here offered to do that for me?"
3,Ross," people (shakes head, they sit) so why you all dressed
  up."
4,Phoebe, oh umm Mike's picking me up for a date.
5,Ross," oh yea now um how is that going, is it getting serious?"
6,Phoebe," oh I dunno I dunno, you know I mean I like him but
  am I ready to take my grade a loins off the meat market."
7,Ross," you know I really admire your whole dating attitude,
  it's so healthy I'm always like is this moving to fast? Is this moving to slow?
  Where's this going?"
8,Phoebe, yea you know you are a bit of a drama queen.
9,Ross," but you, your so much better off you just go from
  guy to guy having fun and never worrying that it terns into anything serious."
10,Phoebe," I wouldn't say never, you know there's that guy
  (pause) well what about (pause) ok well there's gotta be someone."
11,Ross, There isn't that's what I'm saying. (All happy)
12,Phoebe, Oh my god you're right.
13,Ross," I know and yet here you are all ready for the next
  date."
14,Phoebe," I can't believe I never realized this before, I'm

  crying) what's wrong with me."
15,Ross," no, no, no there's nothing wrong with you I mean you
  don't strike me as the type of person that wants to get married anyway."
16,Phoebe, I wanna get married (grabs a tissue)
17,Ross," please don't cry because of me pheebs I don't know
  what I'm talking about, I've been divorced three times."

  scared)"
59,Ross, so how'd the date go?

63,Ross, now I feel terrible this is all my fault.
64,Phoebe," well you not what you should feel terrible about,

  know how hard it is to meet a guy like that?"
65,Ross, We are a rare breed.
68,Joey," yeah and hey thanks again for letting me having that
  last piece of cake at the restaurant."
70,Joey, do you have any cake?

85,Ross," oh no yeah, no Phoebe is great, but umm I'm an idiot

87,Ross," yes, yeah I said something stupid about her never
  having had a serious relationship, but you should know she is so much fun,
  a wonderful person please don't blow her off."
89,Ross," well then I didn't need to bother you or the four
  other Mike Hanagens I bothered."
91,Ross," of course she has. if she'd never had a serious relationship
  I'd go round broadcasting it like some unstoppable moron."
93,Ross," yes, yes I did. and I will also say what I'm about
  to say Vis-à-vis the following Phoebe has never had a serious relationship
  since her. super-serious relationship with. Vicrum."
95,Ross, WHAT THAT'S A REAL NAME!
97,Chandler," (enters singing) Oklahoma where the wind comes
  sweeping down the plane, STOP IT! Why couldn't they have sent me to Texas?
  7 o clock maybe I'll hit the gym (sits down) who am I kidding pay-per-view
  porn."
99,Chandler, DO NOT DISTURB DO NOT DISTURB! Monica (smiles)
100,Monica, is everything all right?
101,Chandler," everything's great, just watching some regular
  television there, what a pleasant surprise. (She hugs him, and she knows what
  he was doing so she looks at the TV and sees sharks swimming around thinking
  Chandler was giving himself a treat to sharks.)"
102,Monica, I'm gonna go freshen up ok
103,Chandler, Ok honey. that was close.
105,Rachel, Hello
106,Monica," Hey Rach its me ok I just got the Chandler's room

115,Rachel," man sharks. I always knew there was something weird
  about that dude. But you promised to love him no matter what."
116,Monica," what means if he gets like a disease or kills someone.
  not if he gets his jollys to jaws!"
117,Rachel," Ah! You know what honey guys are just different,
  they like things that we can't understand, you know I once dated this guy who
  wanted to pretend he was an archeologist and I was a naughty cave woman that

  New York and now you're just going around again."
125,Joey," well that's not even the weird part. I don't think
  she remembered sleeping with me."
126,Monica, But you don't remember sleeping with her.
127,Joey," yeah but she should remember sleeping with me I am
  very memorable, you guys know."
128,Rachel," what, how do we know, we never slept with you."
129,Joey, and who's fault is that.
130,Monica," what's the big deal, you forgot, she forgot, maybe
  you were having an off night"
131,Joey," HEY! I never have an off night ok although sometimes
  when I'm a little bloated I don't feel very sexy BUT EVEN THEN I'M BETTER THEN
  MOST!"
132,Monica," Honey why don't you just let it go and ask her
  out again."
133,Rachel," yeah your both so slutty you don't even remember
  who you've slept with, you're made for each other."
134,Joey," Interesting. all right I'll go out with her again
  and try to get past it (reaches for the chips) OH SALT BLOATY!"
135,Monica," Joey, Joey."

  around) quick thing, I went to talk to Mike."
145,Phoebe, What? Wha-wha-wha-did you do ROSS!
146,Ross," oh boy you got mad at that part. I went over there
  to tell him how great you are but you know me BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, and I ended
  up telling him that."
147,Phoebe, WHAT!
148,Ross," umm. that you had a six year long relationship with
  a guy named Vicrum."
149,Phoebe, WHAT! WHY?
150,Ross," well he seemed to bum hard that you'd never been in
  a serious relationship."
151,Phoebe," (Walks towards Ross) If you hadn't just had a baby
  with my best friend I swear to Lucifer a raber dog would be feasting on your
  danglers RIGHT NOW!"
152,Ross," well Phoebe, I think you'll feel better when you know
  a little bit about Vicrum, His a Kite designer (He makes a wow face) and he
  used to date Oprah. (He makes another wow face)"
153,Phoebe," I'm not going along with some lie you made Ross,
  No I'm just gonna be honest with him."
154,Ross, Good yeah just be honest with him.
155,Phoebe," yeah I've nothing to be ashamed of ok so I haven't
  been in a relationship that lasted longer then a month. Ok I haven't had a
  real boyfriend you know if he can't handle that he can leave. which he will
  and that's ok. so I'll just be alone forever you know alright I'll be. it'll
  be fine. it'll be fine. I'll go walking tours with widows and lesbians. Oh
  (takes a deep breath and sits down, knock on the door)"
156,Ross, I'll get it
157,Phoebe, ok
159,Phoebe," Uh huh yeah (stands up) there's just something umm,
  there's something you should know (Pause) Vicrum just called."
162,Joey," Uh huh, sure, yeah. How can you not remember me?"
164,Joey, How could you not remember that we slept together?
166,Joey, I dunno!
168,Joey," come on, come on, search your brain all right. it
  was (thinks) a certain amount of time ago, I was here you were here, we had
  sex (starts pointing out the places) here, here, here NOT there. Anything?"
170,Joey," my god woman! How many people do you have to had been
  with not to remember any of this?"
172,Joey," Ooooooooooh, I slept with you! And you obviously remember
  me Hey! I still got it. (Turns back to Hayley) so were good. (She just glares
  at him) I'll let myself out."
174,Phoebe," .and I said Vicrum you can't just call every time
  you get lonely you know, you, you gave up that right when you slept with Rachel."
176,Phoebe," yeah well (pause) yeah you know Emma's birth certificate
  might say Geller but her eyes say Mookurgee."
178,Phoebe," I know but he call's and my heart goes to him. You
  know that bastard is one smooth talking free lance kite designer."
180,Phoebe, Oh.
182,Phoebe, ok I can't do this.
184,Phoebe," well there is no Vicrum, Ross made him up because
  I never really have been in a long-term relationship, I've never lived with
  a guy, and I've never even celebrated an anniversary so. (Pause) if that's
  too weird for you and you wanna leave I totally understand. In fact I'll close
  my eye's make it less awkward (She sits with her eyes closed and Mike kisses
  her, Phoebe opens her eyes and like a little child says.) You kissed me."
186,Phoebe, so you don't think I'm a total freak
188,Phoebe," I guess so, can I. can I think it's cool that you
  kiss me and also wanna kiss you again (they get closer to kiss and Phoebe pulls
  back) and umm, be a little concerned about the magic markers."
190,Ross," (They kiss and the phone rings and machine picks it
  up, its Ross putting on an accent pretending to be Vicrum) This is Vicrum."
192,Chandler, Hi honey I'm home!
193,Monica," Hi, how was your flight? (She hugs him)"
194,Chandler, oh it was great.
195,Monica," Here why don't you sit down, get yourself comfortable
  because I. (Monica shows him the tape then puts it in) have
  a little surprise for you."
196,Chandler," well, well, well it must be five in Tulsa because
  it's six o clock IN NY.C!"
197,Monica," Ok (sits down next to him) This is how much I love
  you. (She presses play then puts her arm around Chandler's neck.)"
198,Chandler," (Chandler looking confused) Honey why am I watching
  a bunch of sharks swimming around."
199,Monica," Is this not the good part? Do you want me to fast
  forward to something a little toothier."
200,Chandler," no I'm not quite sure you got the right movie
  that's all."
201,Monica," Oh well this is the only one they had at our video
  store, but they did have something called crocodile killers. Or does it always
  have to be sharks?"
202,Chandler, does what always have to be sharks.
203,Monica," Honey look we can do something else, do you want
  me to get into the tub and thrash."
204,Chandler, What's going on?
205,Monica," sweetie it's ok, I still love you, let me be a
  part of this."
206,Chandler, let ME be a part of this!
207,Monica," I saw what you were doing in Tulsa. angry sharks
  turn you on!"
208,Chandler, no they don't
209,Monica," then why were you watching them and giving YOURSELF
  a treat."
210,Chandler," OH MY GOD! When you came in I switched the channel,
  I was just watching regular porn"
211,Monica, really?
212,Chandler," yeah just some good old fashion girl on girl American
  action."
213,Monica," I cannot tell you how happy that makes me! (They
  hug)"
214,Chandler," You are an amazing wife. (Monica shrugs) No really
  you're amazing you were actually gonna do this for me, I mean where do you
  find the strength and understanding over something like that."
215,Monica," Im very, very drunk right now."
218,Joey," (looks at a girl walk in) see ordinarily I would talk
  to her, but my confidence is shaken did I sleep with her? Did I not sleep with
  her?"
220,Joey," your right! I love my life! (He gets up to go and
  speak to the girl and he turns back and sits down) I actually did sleep with
  her."
0,Phoebe," Oh hey you guys, I couldnt get a reservation for the night of 
my birthday, so we have to do dinner Thursday night instead."
1,Joey, Thursday? But thats Halloween.
2,Phoebe, So?
3,Joey," [Its just] So spooky, thats all."
4,Ross," So, so, is Mike coming to dinner?"
5,Phoebe," No! Its my first birthday with a boyfriend, and he has to 
work. Uch, I get mad at him, but I think its a little to soon to show my true 
colors."
6,Rachel," Pheebs, I would make a reservation for five, because one of us 
has to stay home and watch Emma. (to Ross) Which one of us should go to 
dinner?"
7,Phoebe," Oh, Rachel!"
8,Ross," Actually, um, I was thinking maybe both of us could go."
9,Phoebe," Oh, yay!"
10,Ross," Thanks, I put a lot of extra thoughts on your gift."
11,Phoebe," Alright, okay, so we can all go now. That is fun. Hey, you 
know what? We all havent been together the six of us in such a long time."
12,Monica, What are you talking about? Were all together right now.
13,Rachel," Um, Mon, Chandlers not here."
14,Monica," Oh, dear god!"
17,Chandler," Good morning everyone, its nice to see our team together 
for the first time. Now, before we get started, are there any questions? 
(colleague raises hand) Yes, Ken is it?"
19,Chandler," (laughs) Well, dont believe everything you hear, Ken. (both 
turning away to files) But yeah, thats true. Alright, lets get started, by 
take a look at last quarters figures. (The female next to Chandler starts 
smoking, towards her) Ah, Claudia, arent you supposed to blow smoke up the 
bosses ass?"
21,Chandler," No, no, no-no-no. I smoked for years, then I quit. Right 
now, I cant remember why. (to everyone) Youre not allowed to smoke in this 
office. Not right?"
23,Chandler," Alright, lolook. I dont smoke anymore. But if the rest of 
you want to light up, go ahead, its fine. (everyone lights up) So you all smoke 
then? Thats almost rude, that Im not."
25,Chandler," (loud) Ken, please! No, I cant, I cant smoke. If I smoke, 
my wife would kill me."
27,Chandler," I always liked you, Ken. (takes a cigarette)"
29,Phoebe," (from outside) Trick or treat! (Its obviously Halloween eve, 
the night of her birthday dinner.)"
30,Monica, (opening the door) Hey!
31,Phoebe," Ooh, and treat it is. (Monicas breasts.)"
32,Monica, Hmhmm. (ties up)
33,Phoebe," Wow, so glad I changed. Almost wore my ??? outfit that cant 
contain my breasts."
34,Monica," This is not, what Im wearing. Im ovulating and Chandlers 
gonna be home any minute, so I thought we would try before dinner."
35,Phoebe," Ohh. Oh wait! (Jis) you guys wont be late for my dinner, will 
you?"
36,Monica," Believe me, Chandler and I have not seen each other in over a 
week. Well probably be the first ones there."
37,Phoebe," kay, see you there. Happy humping! (outside meeting 
Chandler.) Heyhey! Oh, wow, somebody smoked out here? Oh my god, dont people 
know, youre not allowed to smoke in public spaces?"
38,Chandler," Actually, in Oklahoma smoking is legal in all commune areas 
and offices with fewer than fifteen people."
39,Phoebe, You smoked!
40,Chandler," No! I just happened tdo a lot trivias about smoking in 
different states. For example, in Hawaii cigarettes are called 
Leyhallalookoos."
41,Phoebe," (smells at him) Chandler, you stink of cigarettes."
42,Chandler," Uch, do you think, Monica is gonna be able smell it?"
43,Phoebe," Are you kidding? The woman has the nose of a bloodhound  and 
the breasts of a Greek goddess."
44,Chandler, Pheebs?
45,Phoebe, (embarrassed) Im gonna go. (leaves to stairs)
46,Chandler," (getting in) Okay, something to cover the smell  Oven 
cleaner! (sprays himself, reads label) Unscented!"
47,Monica," (naughty in doorway) Welcome home. Ive missed you. join me in 
the bedroom?"
48,Chandler," No thanks, Im good."
49,Monica," (comes over) O-kay, so you wanna play it that way, do you?"
50,Chandler," (shrinks back) Right. You know what? Actually I just get off 
the plane, so Im feeling kinda gross. Maybe I should just take a shower."
51,Monica, You dont need a shower.
52,Chandler," (still backs away) Alright, the truth is, I soiled myself 
during some turbulences."
53,Monica," What do I smell? (sniffs him) I smell smoke. Huhdid you 
smoke?"
54,Chandler," Yes, but I just had one. Two. Two tiny cigarettes. Okay, 
five. A pack. Two packaa carton. Three big fat cartons in two days. (How many 
cigarettes are there in one pack and how many packs in one carton in the US?) 
But its over, I made a decision, Im not gonna smoke anymore."
55,Monica, (gets a pack out of his jacket)
56,Chandler," But, those are for you."
58,Ross," Alright, well just, uh, see when you get here. Bye. (hangs up) 
Huh, that was my mom, shes stuck in terrible traffic."
59,Rachel," Okay, well thats now the third sign that I should not leave 
Emma."
60,Ross," Oh, what were the other two?"
61,Rachel," Well, lets see. The first one is I dont want to. And, you 
know, Im not going."
62,Ross," I know, its the first time, were leaving the baby and  hey, I 
know how hard it is for you, but  but Emma is gonna be fine. My mom is gonna be 
with her. Shes great with kids."
63,Rachel, She is?
64,Ross, Ya.
65,Rachel, What about (?) Monica.
66,Ross," Hey, you only heard Monicas side of that. That little fatso was 
a terror."
67,Rachel, Ish. I just dont think I can bear it.
68,Ross," Rachel, I know that you can. And you should."
69,Rachel, Uch.
70,Ross," Really, it would be good for you and in fact, why dont you, why 
dont you go ahead to the restaurant and I will wait for my mom and then Ill 
meet you there."
71,Rachel, Oh-A.
72,Ross," No, no, really. You should go. Just go! Go! Go out! Really, the 
world is your oyster. Kick up the heels. Paint the town red. (Slang right?)"
73,Rachel, You need to learn some new slang.
74,Ross," Im serious. Cmon, you should go. Here. (shoves her outside, 
while she tries to stay) No, uh-uh, just go."
75,Rachel, What  Oh! (points inside)
76,Ross," No! No, you know what? (closes the door) You [cant get in 
there] (?), the babys fine, now squam (?). Yeah, [I told you a|Tell your] story 
walking. (?)"
77,Rachel, I was just going to say that I left my keys.
78,Ross," Oh, (door is locked) holy molly are we in a pickle now."
80,Phoebe, Where is everyone? Theyre forty minutes late.
81,Joey," I know, u-uch."
82,Phoebe," Im starving. I know we were coming here tonight, I ate 
nothing all day."
83,Joey," What about me, he? Only had one lunch today."
85,Phoebe," Yes, they are expected presently. Yeah, yeah um, their arrival 
is in the offing."
87,Joey," No, theyre comin, were waitin right here."
88,Phoebe," Joseph! (to waiter) Thou neednt worry, they shant be 
long."
90,Phoebe, One really does have a stick up ones ass. Doesnt one?
92,Monica," How can you smoke in this day of age? Do you not seen that ad 
with a little kid walks to grandpa, its chilling."
93,Chandler," I messed up, it was a meeting, everybody was smoking."
94,Monica, So what? Dont you have any will power?
95,Chandler," Will power? Ive watch home movies of you eating ding-dongs 
(?) without taking the tin foil off."
96,Monica, You said that was sexy!
97,Chandler," kay, look Can we just drop this? Im not gonna smoke 
again."
98,Monica," Thats right, because I forbid you to smoke again."
99,Chandler, You forbid me?
100,Monica, Mhmm.
101,Chandler," You know, I flew a long way t see my loving wife? Is she 
here by the way?"
102,Monica," Dont joke (?) with me, okay? Im very, very upset right 
now."
103,Chandler," Oh, would you say this was the most upset you could be?"
104,Monica, Yes.
105,Chandler," Then, I might as well  (grabs the cigarettes) do this 
(lights one, exhales). Not really sure what to do now."
106,Monica," Well, Ill tell you what were gonna do We are already late 
for Phoebes birthday dinner, so you point out put out that cigarette, were 
gonna put this fight on hold and go have sex."
107,Chandler, Fine. What!?
108,Monica," Sex! This is the last day Im ovulating, and when we dont do 
it now, well have to wait till next month. (walks towards bedroom)"
109,Chandler, You serious? (follows)
110,Monica, Oh yeah!
111,Chandler," Right, fine, Ill do it, but no talking."
112,Monica," Huh, and no cuddling."
113,Chandler, And no kissing your neck.
114,Monica," Oh good, I hate it when you do that"
115,Chandler, And lots of kissing your neck.
117,Ross," Okay, well the ??? is not home."
118,Rachel, No. Uch.
119,Ross," Oh-oh, wait, my mother is gonna be here any minute. And she has 
the keys."
120,Rachel," Alright, I cant, I cant wait that long. You have to do 
somethingknock that door down!"
121,Ross," I would, but I bruise like a peach. Besides, yyou know, 
everything is gonna be fine. The babys sleeping."
122,Rachel, What if she jumped out the bassinet?
123,Ross," Cant hold her own head up, but yeah jumped."
124,Rachel," Oh my god, I left the water running."
125,Ross," Rach you did not leave the water running. Please, just pull 
yourself together, okay?"
126,Rachel," Ah, did I leave the stove on?"
127,Ross," You never cooked since 1996. (Actually Rachel cooked in 609 - 
TOW Ross Got High, first aired 1999-11-25.)"
128,Rachel," Is the window open? Because if theres a window open, a bird 
could fly in there."
129,Ross," Oh my god, you know what, yeah, I think youre right. I think  
listen, listen!"
130,Rachel, Ubb.
131,Ross," A pigeon, a pigeon. (previously scared Rachel turns away) No, no 
wait, no-no, an eagle flew in. Landed on the stove and caught fire. The baby, 
seeing this, jumps across the apartment to the mighty birds aid. The eagle, 
however, misconstrues as an act of aggression and grabs the baby on its talon. 
Meanwhile the faucet fills the apartment with water. Baby and bird still up lays 
(?) are locked in a death grip, swirling around the whirl pool, that fills the 
apartment."
132,Rachel," Boy, are you gonna be sorry if thats true."
137,Joey, Maybe we should just eat now.
139,Joey," Wha-a how about this Another table leaves, right? But theres 
still some food left on their place, okay, whats the restaurants policy about 
people eatin that?"
141,Joey," But it happens? (waiter leaves) Im gotta go to the 
bathroom."
142,Phoebe," No, you cant go. No-no-no, I cant hold this table on my own. 
If they ask me to move, I cave."
143,Joey," If you ask me to stay, Ill pee. (leaves)"
145,Phoebe," Okay, fine, Ill move. Alright, you dont have to manhandle 
me. (gets up) Where? (he points at a smaller table) Okay. Thank you. Wach."
146,Joey," (returns to their old table where elderly people are sitting 
now, sits) Finally you guys made it. (looks up, turns left to Phoebes chair) 
Pheebs, who the helluhuhh!"
148,Monica, Spend more time with the tie. Thatll make a baby.
149,Chandler," Look, I cant do this. I cant make luv to you while were 
fighting this way."
150,Monica," Oh sure, now youre Mister Sensitivity. But when you wanted to 
have sex right after my uncles funeral"
151,Chandler," That was a celebration of life. Alright, look, Im not gonna 
do this. Alright, is this really the way you want a baby to be conceived?"
152,Monica," No, youre right. Mnya, we shouldnt do it like this. Huch. 
For what its worth, Im, Im sorry. I shouldnt have come down on you so hard 
about the smoking. So you had a few cigarettes, not the end of the world."
153,Chandler, Mean it?
154,Monica, Yah.
155,Chandler," You are incredible. Unless, IIm not gonna smoke again. And 
if I do, I promise, I will hide it so much better from you. (they kiss)"
156,Monica, Dyou want to?
157,Chandler," Yeah, lets celebrate life!"
158,Monica, kay.
160,Rachel," Och, god. (seeing Emma) Oh, thank god, youre okay. Im so 
sorry we left you. Mom never gonna leave you again. Never ever ever again. 
Uch."
161,Ross, Great. So lets get going?
162,Rachel," Oh no. I mean it. After what just happened, Im never leaving 
her again."
164,Ross, Somehow over time it got easier to be apart from you.
166,Chandler, Uhh. You are welcome.
167,Monica, You know what? Lets not talk.
168,Chandler, What?
169,Monica, Uch. I am still so mad at you for smoking.
170,Chandler," But you said you forgave me. It was just a couple of 
cigarettesno big deal."
171,Monica," Oh, blablablabaybaybay."
172,Chandler, Leave it.
173,Monica," I was just saying that because I was ovulating and you said 
you wouldnt have sex with me while were fighting."
174,Chandler, You tricked me to get me into bed?
175,Monica," Thats right, I got mine."
176,Chandler, I feel so used.
178,Phoebe," Well, I guess theyre not coming. You wanna just order?"
179,Joey," Thank you. (stands up and kisses her lips.) Waiter! lright, 
this is gonna be fast, so try to keep up Risotto with the shaped truffles and 
the roasted rip steak with the golden Chanterelles and a Bordelaise sauce and 
that any that stuff I just said means snails. (Hope, *I* kept up.)"
181,Phoebe, Tomato tart and which of the pastas would you recommend?
183,Phoebe," Both it is, thank you."
184,Joey," Oh, uh, again. Can I make a special request Can you bring 
everything as soon as its ready? Appetizers, entrees, we dont care."
187,Phoebe, You guys are over an hour late. What happened to you two?
188,Ross, Im so sorry 
189,Rachel," We got locked out of the apartment, we "
190,Joey, Thats a great storycan I eat it?
191,Ross, And then Rachel wasnt sure she could leave the baby.
192,Rachel," N-it wasnt easy, but its your birthday and I did what I got 
to do."
193,Phoebe, And thats Judy over there at the bar with Emma?
194,Rachel," Oh honey, this is for the best, thus Im not distracted, 
worrying about Emma, how shes doing at home and Im being completely here with 
you and, oh, she spit up!"
195,Ross, What?
196,Rachel," She spit up. Judy! She spiJudy! Look alive, Judy! (they sit 
down) Thank you."
197,Ross, Thanks. Oh.
198,Rachel," Oh, ooh, everything looks delicious. What should I ha-ave? 
What should I have?"
199,Joey, (mumbling) Never hit a woman. Never hit a woman.
200,Ross, Yknow this ??? is incredible.
201,Joey, Ross bruises like a peach. He bruises like a peach.
202,Ross," Okay, Ill have the fixed salad and the duck."
203,Rachel," Yah, Ill have the soup and the salmon."
204,Joey," And remember whatever comes up first. Okay? And hurry, because 
"
205,Monica, (entering with husband) Happy birthday!
206,Joey, Son of a bitch!
207,Phoebe, Wher-where have you been?
208,Monica," Well, we had a little fight."
209,Chandler, I would never lie to get someone into bed.
210,Monica," You used to tell girls you were a Kennedy. (being sat down) 
Ooh, uh, thanks. Wow, little tight, isnt it? How dyou get a bigger table? 
You-you had a big table, but they made you move. Huh-huh, shut up Monica. Whoo, 
I suppose that Chandler will have the smoked duck."
211,Chandler," I suppose that Monica will have the  manipulative 
shrew."
213,Joey," Why are you going? He said, she wanted the shrew! (runs after 
the waiter)"
214,Ross," Rach, cmon, Emma is fine. Youre turning into an obsessive 
mother. Okay, you need to stop."
215,Rachel," Yguys ever heard the story about when Rosses mom went to the 
beauty salon?"
216,Chandler, You mean the lully story?
217,Ross," (childish) Huh-huh, they already know it."
218,Phoebe," You guys, weve been waiting for you for a long time, maybe 
you should order."
219,Joey," (returned) No, no, its okay, I already told the waiter what 
they want."
220,Monica, Why would you do that?
221,Joey," Chandler, control your woman!"
222,Rachel," (lifts for a toast) Okay, as everybody has ordered, I would 
like to start the celebration and make a toast  to Phoebe. She dropped her 
sock."
223,Phoebe, Aw  what?
224,Rachel," N-no, Emma dropped her sock."
225,Monica," Moms here? I wanted to have lunch with her today, she told me 
she was out of town."
226,Rachel," Ross, she still has not noticed that the babys sock is on the 
ground."
227,Phoebe, s a good toast.
228,Rachel, (to Ross) Could you please get her attention?
229,Ross, W-oa  Mommy! (gestures to his not understanding mother)
230,Phoebe," (getting up) Oh, for gods sake, Judy, pick up the sock! Pick 
up the sock! Pick up the sock! (everybody scared) Im sorry, was that rude? 
Di-did my, my li-little outburst blunt (?) the hideousness (?) that is this 
evening? Look, I know, you all have a lot going on, but all I wanted to do was 
have dinner with my friends on my birthday. And you are all so late and you 
didnt even have the courtesy to call. (her cellular rings) Well, its too late 
now."
231,Ross," Well, ??? think thats us?"
232,Phoebe," well, this is, this is, this is not over! (on phone) 
Hello?"
233,Joey," (to Chandler and Monica) Well, what is going on with you 
two?"
234,Monica," Uch, you see, Im ovulating."
235,Chandler," Oh yeah, thats what she says. But maybe youre not 
ovulating at all, maybe its just a clever ruse to get me into bed."
236,Monica," Yes smokie, that is what it was. I just cant get enough."
237,Chandler," (to Joey) You not gonna believe this She lied! She tricked 
me into having sex with her."
238,Joey," So? Did have sex, right?"
239,Chandler, Whats the matter with me? Why Im such a girl?
240,Phoebe," (returns) Okay, that was Mike."
241,Rachel," Phoebe, hi, were so sorry. Youre totally right. We are here 
one hundred per cent and we love you and we are ready to start your birthday 
celebration."
242,Phoebe," Mhuh, guys, that means the world to me. Huh, nkay, Im gonna 
take off."
243,Rachel, What?
244,Phoebe," Oh, I love you guys too, but Mike got off work early. Wait. 
Wait, Im not tnot that kind of girl that just ditches her friends to be with 
her boyfriend. You know what? I am. Bye guys! (waves to the bar) Judy! Bye."
245,Rachel," Oh thank god, if Phoebes going, can we please take Emma 
home?"
246,Ross," You know, I think thats a good ideaour babysitter just pounded 
in another Chardonnet. (both get up) Bye, yguys."
247,Monica, Bye.
248,Joey," See ya. Well, this is just us."
250,Monica," So, Im, Im probably still ovulating. Do you want to give it 
another try?"
251,Chandler," So you never had sex with a Kennedy, have you?"
252,Joey," Do, do you gonna do it now?"
253,Monica," We dont have much time. Once the egg descended the oviduct 
"
254,Joey," No-ohoh. (the Bings leave, the waiter comes)"
256,Joey," Nah, just me. All alone. (all the food is served) Dinner for six 
for one, uh, you boys are about to see something really special."
260,Joey, Excellent. The shrew in particular was exclusive.
263,Joey, Joey! Joey.
265,Joey, Thats the best birthday ever.
1,Chandler," (picking up the telephone, answering it with a frog 
  in his throat) Hello? (he clears his throat, but he still has the same frog 
  in his throat when he speaks again) Hello?"
2,Monica," (in her apartment, screaming) I LOVE MY NEW JOB!"
3,Chandler," Honey, you're screaming."
4,Monica," YOU BET YOUR ASS I AM! I just had the best first day 
  ever! The kitchen twice as big as Allessandro's."
5,Chandler," (yawning) Oh, that's great."
6,Monica," Yeah, a-a-and clean. Not just health department clean... 
  Monica clean."
7,Chandler, (clearly not so interested) Awesome.
8,Monica," Oh, and the people are so nice. There's this one guy, 
  Geoffrey, he's the Maitre D., Chandler, you will love him. He is without a doubt, 
  the funniest guy I have ever met. (Chandler, who was almost asleep again, sits 
  up straight in bed in an instant and can't believe what he just heard.)"
12,Phoebe," I know! (Phoebe picks up a little packet of sugar, 
  shakes it, and then realises she can't open it with one hand, but doesn't want 
  to let go of Mike's hand. She tries to tear open the packet with one hand.)"
14,Phoebe," Yeah, I kinda do. (Mike lets go of her hand) Well, 
  how's this? (she takes Mike's hand and puts it on her breast, she tears open 
  the sugar and puts it in her coffee. Mike thinks it over and nods appreciative. 
  After that, they hold hands again. Joey now enters, and sees the two sitting 
  on the couch, holding hands.)"
15,Joey," (in a very aaaaahhhhh sweeeeeet voice) Aaahhh, look 
  at you two... holding hands... huh is this getting serious? (Phoebe and Mike, 
  embarrassed, start babbling and look away.) Have you not talked about it yet? 
  (They say nothing now, but smile) Am I making you uncomfortable? (smiles are 
  becoming forced now, and he speaks to Mike) If you were bigger you'd hit me, 
  huh...? Aaaaaahhhhhh (he turns away to the bar)"
16,Phoebe," I'm sorry... I'm sorry. It's obviously way too early 
  for us to be... having that conversation."
18,Phoebe," (in a flash she answers) Maybe not, is it?"
20,Phoebe," (impatient) I know Mike, why don't you keep digging?"
22,Phoebe," Oh, it's a key. To be honest, I think I'd prefer the 
  five dollars."
24,Phoebe," (really surprised) Oh wow, ooh! Ooh, big step for 
  Phoebe and Mike."
26,Phoebe," Oh no, I want to."
28,Phoebe," Yeah... ooh... wow... Even started to think I'd never 
  meet someone that, you know, I wanted to... do this with. Here you go. (Both 
  Phoebe and Mike look really proud.)"
30,Phoebe, It really is.
31,Joey," (sitting at his table) Oh, I know it... It 
  is amazing these little things open doors... huh! (mimes opening a door with 
  his own keys, Phoebe looks at him in a ""yeah, yeah, yeah"" way.)"
33,Rachel," So I don't go back to work for another four weeks, 
  but we would like our nanny to start right away, so that Emma could get a chance 
  to know her."
35,Rachel," That's great, great. So do you have any questions 
  for us?"
37,Rachel," Allright. Well thank you so much for coming... (they're 
  standing up and make their way to the door)"
38,Ross, Thank you.
39,Rachel, Really nice to meet you... and we'll call you.
41,Ross," Boy, we uhm... hadn't really thought of that."
43,Rachel," Okidoki! (and she slams the door in the nanny's face 
  while Ross crumples up the application form) Wow! We're never gonna find a nanny."
44,Ross," Oh, come on Rach, we will. I promise. We have more interviews 
  (They sit down and Rachel sighs) And worse comes to worse, we can always reconsider 
  the uhm... the first one we met with."
45,Rachel," (indignant) What, the blonde with no bra?"
46,Ross," She was blonde? (he looks surprised for a while, but 
  then gets a ""gotcha"" expression on his face... There's knocking at 
  the door.) Just a sec.! Okay, okay. This one's name is Sandy. She's got a degree 
  in early childhood education, uhm... she worked for her last family for three 
  years."
47,Rachel, Okay... (Ross opens the door.)
49,Ross, And she's a little mannish...
51,Phoebe, (gasps) Oh my God! David!
53,Phoebe," (excited) No! It's a great time, come in...! WOW, 
  hi... Oh my gosh! What are you doing here? Are you back from Minsk?"
55,Phoebe," Who cares, it got you here."
57,Phoebe, Wow. Where is your luggage? (David thinks for a while)
59,Phoebe," A-Allright, well... I'll call the cab company."
61,Phoebe," Thank you! God, no! You should see me when... Oh actually, 
  no, I look pretty good."
63,Phoebe, No...
65,Phoebe," I'm... I'm just... I'm the worst person ever. How 
  can I not tell David that I'm seeing Mike?"
66,Monica, Maybe he didn't give you a chance.
67,Phoebe, He said Are you seeing someone? And I said no...
68,Monica," Oh, well... That had been your window."
69,Phoebe," Yeah! I mean, I don't know. I was just , I was looking, 
  I was looking in his eyes and I was just thinking Oh my God! It's David. David's 
  here. He's just, he's so irresistible."
70,Monica, Really? The scientist guy?
71,Phoebe, Really? Chandler?
72,Monica, Continue...
73,Phoebe," Oh.Okay, then it gets worse, 'cause then I told him 
  that I would see him tomorrow night."
74,Monica, Phoebe!
75,Phoebe," I know! (points at herself) Evil! And... and... and... 
  I like Mike so much, you know. It's just going really well. Oh my God!"
76,Monica," Wow, isn't it ironic that David would show up on the 
  same day that you and Mike exchange keys?"
77,Phoebe," (sarcastically) Uhuh... Yeah...!, you know. And given 
  my life long search for irony, you can imagine how happy I am."
78,Monica, What are you gonna do?
79,Phoebe," I mean I guess, I just have to... tell David that 
  nothing can happen between us. Unless I don't... You know, complicated 
  moral situation, no right, no wrong..."
80,Monica, You have to tell David!
81,Phoebe," Okay, I knew I should have had this conversation 
  with Joey."
83,Chandler," (angry) Funniest guy she's ever met! (to the door) 
  I'm funny, right...? What do you know, you're a door... You just like knock-knock 
  jokes... (laughs about himself, but then gets determined again) Save it for 
  inside! (he enters)"
84,Monica, Heeeeeey! 
85,Chandler, Hey!
86,Phoebe, Hey!
87,Chandler," So... Oklahoma is a crazy place. You know, they 
  call it the Sooner state. Frankly I'd sooner be in any other state. (Monica 
  looks at Phoebe, who also doesn't know what to say.) And what's with Oklahoma 
  having a pan handle? Can all states have stuff like that? Hey yeah, I'm from 
  the waistband, Wyoming. But when I was seven, we headed over to the crotch."
88,Monica," (Doesn't believe what she's hearing) Was your cabin 
  pressurised?"
89,Chandler," (laughs, but then moves to Phoebe) And don't get 
  me started on the way that people from Tulsa talk."
90,Phoebe, Okay. (and she walks away)
91,Chandler," What's with the word y'all? You know, just... two 
  words just... pushed together... Are we all allowed to do that, because if so, 
  I say why stop there? You know, your new poodle could be your noodle. And fried 
  chicken? Could be fricken.Waiter, waiter excuse me, I'll have the fricken? (Monica 
  laughs) See, that's... that's funny with the fricken, right?"
92,Monica," No, it just remind me of something this guy did today 
  at work. I told you about that funny guy, Geoffrey, right?"
93,Chandler," Yeah, he came up..."
94,Monica," Well, he did this bit... You probably had to be there, 
  but it was Liza Minelli locked in our freezer, eating a raw chicken. (Phoebe 
  bursts out in a laugh)"
95,Chandler, (to Phoebe) Were you there?
96,Phoebe," No, but it sounds like it was fricken funny..."
99,Rachel," Sandy, that's exactly what it is..."
100,Ross," Are you gay? (Rachel turns to Ross in an embarrassed 
  way)"
101,Rachel, Ross!
103,Rachel, Oh!
105,Rachel," Oh, that's pretty."
106,Ross, (skeptic) So you're just like a... guy who's a nanny?
108,Ross," (on a yeah, right tone) Okay."
110,Ross," Yeah, kids say all kinds of crap. (In the other room 
  Emma starts to cry.)"
111,Rachel," Oh God, she mu... she must need her diaper changed."
113,Rachel," Oh, that would be great! (Sandy leaves for Emma's 
  room) I love him, I love him, I love him..."
114,Ross," Oh, come on, Rach, he's a guy!"
115,Rachel," So wh..? He's smart, he's qualified. Give me one good 
  reason we shouldn't try him out."
116,Ross," Because, it's weird!"
117,Rachel, Why?
118,Ross," What kind of job is that for a man? A nanny? I-It's 
  like if a woman wanted to be..."
119,Rachel," (she's got that ""yeah, try to say it"" look 
  on her face) Yes?"
120,Ross, King?
122,Rachel," (whispering and begging) Please? (Ross makes a ""whatever"" 
  gesture) YES! Sandy you're hired."
124,Rachel, Oooh... ***I really can't hear what she says*** come here.
125,Ross, You gotta be at least bi...
128,Chandler," Hey! (Joey doesn't look up, but gestures 'wait a 
  minute' with his finger while he finishes reading the article. Chandler waits 
  for Joey to finish.) I need you to set me up for a joke. Later, when Monica 
  is around, I need you to ask me about fire trucks."
129,Joey," Ooh. I-I don't know Chan. I'm not so good with remembering 
  lines."
130,Chandler," (Can't believe what he hears) Well, thank God your 
  livelihood doesn't depend on it."
131,Joey," I know, right? (Chandler has really big eyes, and nods) 
  Wh... Wh... Why are we doing this?"
132,Chandler," Monica says that her Maitre D. is the funniest guy 
  she's ever met."
133,Joey, Seriously? She actually said that?
134,Chandler, Yes! Am I crazy to be this upset?
135,Joey, Nooooo! Being funny is your thing!
136,Chandler, Yeah!
137,Joey," Without that, you just got ""lame with women""."
138,Chandler," Ye.... (stops because he realises what Joey just 
  said, and stares at him. At this moment Monica enters)"
139,Monica, Hi! There you are.
140,Joey," (sees Monica) Fire trucks! (Chandlers eyes double in 
  size and he turns to Monica who doesn't understand what's happening. Then he 
  turns back to Joey, who says ""you're welcome"" without a sound)"
143,Phoebe, Oof...
145,Phoebe," Oh, wait, wait!"
147,Phoebe," No, no, it's not that. (they go sit on the couch) 
  Uhm... Remember when you asked me if I was seeing someone and I said no? Well, 
  uhm... I am. His ... his name is Mike."
149,Phoebe," Yeah, I should have told you."
151,Phoebe," I'm sorry, I'm sorry."
153,Phoebe, I am happy.
155,Phoebe," Well... but David, just... I just want you to know 
  that... that... you know... telling you this... is one of the hardest things 
  I've ever had to do."
157,Phoebe," Of course, yeah.(they hug and Phoebe sighs... a little 
  after that also David sighs and makes his way to the door) You know, a kiss 
  on the cheek wouldn't be totally inappropriate..."
159,Phoebe," I mean... (David kisses Phoebe on the cheek, makes 
  his way to the door and turns around again)"
161,Phoebe, Yeah?
163,Phoebe," Well, if that's what they do in Minsk... (They kiss 
  2 on each cheek... and then they pause... David turns to the door) In New York... 
  it's... (and then David grabs her by her neck and kisses her full on the lips... 
  They kiss passionately and cannot seem to stop.)"
165,Rachel," (in a tearful voice) Oh... Oh boy... (she turns around 
  and sees Ross) Hi..."
166,Ross, (very worried) Is everything allright?
167,Rachel," Oh yeah, it's fine, it's fine. Sandy was just... was 
  just telling me about how he proposed to his fiancée and it was just 
  sooo beautiful."
169,Rachel, I can't... I can't hear it again.
171,Ross," And I'm fine never having heard it... (Rachel looks 
  at Ross in a ""why do you say that"" manner) Rach, can I... can I see 
  you for a sec?"
172,Rachel," Yeah! (to Sandy) Excuse me... (She walks to the kitchen 
  with Ross and sighs)"
173,Ross," Do you realise that man has cried in our apartment three 
  times...? Huh? I haven't cried that many times since I moved in."
174,Rachel," Look, Ross, he's just... Sandy is just sensitive, 
  that's all."
175,Ross," (picks up a cookie) Okay, okay, see... that... that 
  is the problem. He is too sensitive. (takes a bite from the cookie)"
176,Rachel, What...? Too sensitive to take care of our baby?
177,Ross," (speaking with his mouth full) Yeah, I mean, all things 
  that guy... (looks at the cookie) These are amazing!"
178,Rachel, Sandy made Madeleines.
179,Ross," This... this is exactly what I'm talking about. What 
  kind of a guy makes... makes... delicate French cookies, huh? They're not even... 
  butch, manly cookies with... with... you know with... with chunks. (takes a 
  careful bite from the cookie)"
180,Rachel," Well, I... you know, I-I-I don't know what to say... 
  I mean, I never thought of you as a guy who needed his men to be men. 
  You know, 'cause I gotta tell you Ross, it not like you just came in 
  from branding cattle."
181,Ross, Hey... there's sensitive... and there is too sensitive.
182,Rachel," Okay, what? What is too sensitive? (There's 
  music coming from the living room. Ross opens the door to the living room and 
  he and Rachel see Sandy play a song for Emma on his recorder. Rachel is moved 
  by this, but Ross only sees his point proven again, and walks back into the 
  kitchen, angrily. The door he was holding, swings back and hits Rachel.)"
184,Phoebe," Hmmm... No, no... No, I can't do this. It's bad."
186,Phoebe," No, no. No."
188,Phoebe," Look David, if... if you had never left, then... yeah, 
  we'd probably still be together right now, but... you did leave, and I-I'm with 
  Mike and I really care about him..."
191,Phoebe," (points to David) And you thanks for the 
  face massage. Thank you."
193,Ross, Did Rachel tell you we hired a male nanny?
194,Monica, Yeah! I think that's great!
195,Ross," Oh really? Did she tell you he plays the recorder, recites 
  poetry and bakes Madeleines?"
196,Monica, Oh... How are they?
197,Ross," (looks like in heaven) Lighter than air... (changes 
  back to serious) But that's not the point. (Joey now also enters)"
198,Joey, Hey!
199,Ross, Hey...! Rachel and I hired a male nanny.
200,Joey," (looks surprised) Really...? Guys do that...? That's... 
  weird..."
201,Ross, Thank you!
202,Joey, That's like a woman wanting to be a...
203,Ross, ...a what? A what? What's the end of that sentence?
204,Monica, Yes... What is the end of that sentence?
205,Joey," Uhm... A penis model. (Monica can't believe what's she's 
  hearing and Ross pats Joey on the back.) Anyway, hey... Did you tell Chandler 
  that some guy from work is the funniest guy you've ever met?"
206,Monica," Yeah, so?"
207,Ross, Wow!
208,Joey, Really? Do you not know Chandler?
209,Monica," Is that why he's acting so weird...? He's jealous...? 
  Oh my God, that is crazy. It's not like I'm attracted to Geoffrey..."
210,Joey," So what? Being funny is Chandler's thing... 
  You know, like Ross's thing is... (he can't come up with anything)"
211,Ross, Science...? Academia...? Being a good father...?
212,Joey, ...No... (he just can't seem to grasp it)
213,Monica, I can't believe he's that upset about this...
214,Joey," Monica, you have to do some damage control here, okay. 
  'Cause he's feeling like... (the door opens and Chandler walks in with a pizza)"
215,Chandler, Hey!
216,Joey, Heeeyy! Hey!
217,Chandler, What are you guys talking about?
218,Ross," Uhm... Rachel and I hired a male nanny. (Joey makes 
  a gesture and sound like ""Can you believe that?"")"
219,Chandler," You got a man who's a nanny...? You got a manny...? 
  (Monica starts laughing, but very exaggerated. Joey realises they also should 
  laugh and punches Ross. Now all three of them laugh, but very fake. Chandler 
  seems happy again.)"
220,Chandler," You know, I don't mind a... male nanny, but I do 
  draw the line at a male wetnurse. (again they laugh, even more fake than before)"
221,Monica," Ohhh, ooohhh... you are on a roll, mister!"
222,Chandler," If I'd known you guys were coming over, I would 
  have brought more pizza. (they all burst out in a thundering laugh)"
223,Monica," Okay, okay... Chandler you... you stop it! (Monica 
  wipes away tears)"
224,Chandler," What is so funny about that? (they realise 
  it wasn't a joke)"
225,Monica," Well, I don't know... I-It's... just the way you say 
  it... I mean, you're funny... You have that funny thing. You're a funny guy! 
  (Chandler turns to Joey)"
226,Chandler," Did you tell her what we talked about? (Joey starts 
  laughing hysterically, but then gets serious again...)"
227,Joey, Yeah....
228,Chandler," So those were pity laughs? PITY LAUGHS? (Joey and 
  Ross walk away from the kitchen)"
229,Monica," Honey, listen... You have nothing to worry about with 
  Geoffrey."
230,Chandler, Oh yeah? Is he funnier than me?
231,Monica," Well, you're... you're different funny... I mean, 
  you're... you're more sarcastic a-a-and... well, he does... bits... and impressions... 
  and... and limericks..."
232,Chandler," I do limericks... uhm... There once was a man named 
  Chandler, whose wife made him die inside."
233,Monica," Honey, you know I think you're hilarious! Come on, 
  you know that joke you told me last week? The one about Jerry Lewis and the 
  girl with the lazy eye...? (he laughs) That slayed me."
234,Ross," Hey... I made up that joke and told it to you! (He points 
  at Chandler. Joey gestures to Ross ""What are you doing?)"
235,Joey, Not knowing when to shut up...
236,Ross, Yep! That's my thing...
240,Phoebe," No, no, no, no, no... It's not... it's not... i'ts 
  not as bad as it looks... really. I was just saying goodbye to an old friend."
243,Phoebe," No, uhm... David and I did use to go out... but years 
  ago, and he lives in Minsk. He's only... he's only in town for a couple of days."
245,Phoebe," No, no... "
247,Phoebe," Oh, well, yeah..."
252,Phoebe," Stop it! Stop it, before someone gets really hurt! 
  (they stop and Phoebe gets David's jacket and gives it to him) Here David, you 
  should just go."
258,Phoebe," Okay, well... guys?"
262,Phoebe," I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. If you... If you want your 
  key back, I totally understand."
264,Phoebe," Right! Never! Never! I swear! (They kiss... The door 
  opens and David comes in again.)"
267,Joey," Yeah! Allright! Hey, hey Ross. Check it out! Sandy taught 
  me Hot-cross Buns."
268,Ross, Really? Sounded like Three Blind Mice.
269,Joey," Noooo... Three Blind Mice goes like this... (he puts 
  his fingers in position on the recorder)"
270,Ross," (looks angrily at Joey and points at him) I swear to 
  God...! (Joey is in shock)"
272,Joey, Me! I'm up for puppets!
274,Ross," Okay, okay... How exactly is a two month old supposed 
  to appreciate puppets?"
276,Joey," I wanna be mr. Wigglemunch. (and makes a ""there"" 
  nod to Ross)"
277,Ross, (shakes his head) Oh my God!
280,Rachel, That was kind of rude!
281,Ross," Oh, I'm sorry. Please apologise to Sandy and the Snufflebumps 
  for me."
282,Rachel," You know, he was just doing his job..."
283,Ross," Well, you know what... I-I'm sorry I'm the only one 
  who isn't in love with Gary Poppins out there... But I just... I can't... I 
  can't go through with this."
284,Rachel," Oh, come on Ross..."
285,Ross," No! Hey, you know what? I'm sorry. I would never force 
  you... to hire someone you were this uncomfortable with..."
286,Rachel, (sighs) Oh... That's true.
287,Ross, Thank you!
288,Rachel," Well, you're the one who wants to fire him, so you're 
  gonna have to do it. (Ross walks to the living room determined to fire Sandy)"
291,Joey, (kind of emotional) I am learning so much from you.
293,Chandler," Well, I'm off to Tulsa, so if your Maitre D. friend 
  has any funny Oklahoma jokes, tell him to e-mail me at www.hahanotsomuch.com."
294,Monica," Honey, you can relax. Last night at work, Geoffrey 
  told this really sexist joke. After that, not so funny anymore."
295,Chandler," Really...? See... that's the thing you gotta keep 
  it smart, people!"
296,Monica," Okay, don't miss that flight. You know I love you."
297,Chandler," I love you too. (Monica and Chandler kiss. He turns 
  to Joey.) And... I like you as a friend. (They hug and pat each other on the 
  back.) "
298,Joey, Allright. See you later!
299,Chandler, See ya! (he leaves the apartment)
300,Joey, (to Monica) Did that guy really make that joke?
301,Monica," Naaaa... He still kills me. Last night he had me laughing 
  so hard, I swear... a little pee came out."
303,Ross, Here goes...
304,Rachel," I can't watch. It's like firing Elmo. (Ross walks 
  to the couch where Sandy sits)"
305,Ross," Sandy... Hi, we uhm... we kinda need to talk. I'm afraid 
  it's not working out."
307,Ross," Yeah, uhm... I mean, Rachel and I, think you are great... 
  with Emma... uhm... We just feel..."
308,Rachel, (from behind the bedroom door) YOU! You feel!
309,Ross," I... just feel that the... the chemistry isn't right. 
  I'm sorry. We're... we're more than happy to give you good recommendation..."
311,Rachel," (from bedroom) Oh, damn you Geller!"
312,Ross," Anyway, uhm...Well, I'm glad there's no hard feelings."
314,Ross," No, you know, it's uhm... nothing you did, it's... it's 
  uhm... my issue."
316,Ross," You know, I'm just not uhm... that comfortable with 
  a guy who's as sensitive as you."
318,Ross," Why... I... I don't know. (Sandy tilts his head again) 
  Uhm... errrr... maybe... maybe because of my father?"
320,Ross," I mean, uhm... you know when I was growing up he was 
  kind of a tough guy... You know a-a-and as a kid I wasn't the athlete I am now."
321,Rachel, (from the bedroom) Huh ha ha!
322,Ross," I play squash...! Anyway, uhm... I uhm... I always get 
  the feeling he thought I was too sensitive."
324,Ross," It was hard... I remember... I was in my bedroom... 
  playing with my dinosaurs... playing and learning... and my father 
  walks in and says... he says... ""What are you doing with those things? 
  What's wrong with you, why aren't you... why aren't you outside playing like 
  a... like a real boy?"
326,Ross," I know I am! (Ross now starts to cry) ...And when it's 
  summer, and it's hot, why can't you wear a tank top?"
328,Ross, Here come some more...
334,Joey, Wow! You blow my mind...
336,Joey, Aaahh... How much do I owe you?
338,Joey, It's like the cheapest college ever.
1,Ross," And that's why, no matter what mommy says, we really 
  were on a break. (baby talk) Yes we were! Yes we were! (picks Emma up) Come 
  here gorgeous. (puts her on his knees and talks to her) Oh! Look at you! You 
  are the cutest little baby ever! You're just a... a little bitty baby, you know 
  that? But you've got... (in a softer voice) You've got big beautiful eyes... 
  Yes you do... and a... and a big round belly. (emphasises the B's) Big baby 
  butt! I like big butts. (raps) I like big butts and I cannot lie / you other 
  brothers can't deny / when a girl walks in with an itty, bitty, waist / and 
  a round thing in your face you get...(Emma laughs) Oh my God, Emma... you're 
  laughing! Oh my God, you've never done that before, have you? You never done 
  that before... Daddy made you laugh, huh? Well, daddy and Sir Mix Alot... What? 
  What? You... you wanna hear some more? Uhm...(raps) My anaconda don't want 
  none / unless you got buns hon... (Emma laughs again and Ross looks worried) 
  I'm a terrible father!"
4,Chandler, Hi!
5,Joey, Hey... hey listen... What do you guys know about investments?
6,Chandler, How come?
7,Joey," Well, I'm starting to make good money on the show and 
  I'm thinking... I should probably do something with it."
8,Monica, What do you do with your money now?
9,Joey," Well, I just tape it to the back of my toilet tank. 
  (realises that anyone could have overheard that) I didn't say that! It's in 
  a bank guarded by robots!"
10,Chandler, Do you have any ideas?
11,Joey," Uh, yeah... This guy at work got me excited about going 
  in on an emu farm. That'd be kinda cool huh? Pitchin' in on the weekends, helping 
  to plant the emus..."
12,Monica, Joe... Emus are birds. You raise them for meat.
13,Joey," (laughs) Yeah! Right! (points at Monica) People eat 
  birds... Bird meat... Now do they just fly into your mouth or you go to... you 
  go to a restaurant and you say ""Excuse me, I'll have a bucket of fried 
  bird."" (laughs again) Or... or maybe just a wing or... (realises...)"
14,Monica," Joey, I think you should consider something a little 
  less risky. I mean, I think in this market, real estate is your best investment.The 
  Fed. just lowered the rates and the interest on your mortgage is totally deductible. 
  (looks at Chandler) That's right, I know some stuff!"
15,Joey," Real estate, huh? Hmmm..."
16,Monica," (very excited) Oh, and you know who's selling a great 
  apartment? Richard!"
17,Chandler," (imitating Monica) Oh, and you know whose knowledge 
  of her ex-boyfriend is shocking? Monica!"
18,Monica, My dad told me. They play golf together.
19,Chandler," Oh, well... Maybe I'll join them some time. I just 
  hope the club doesn't slip out of my hand and beat the moustache off his face."
21,Phoebe, Hi!
23,Phoebe," Listen! You have to help me pick a dress 'cause I'm 
  meeting Mike's parents tonight! (Rachel gasps)"
24,Monica," Wow, the boyfriend's parents! That's a big step."
25,Phoebe, (sarcastically) Really? That hadn't occurred to me.
26,Monica," They just gonna love you, just be yourself."
27,Phoebe, They live on the upper east side on Park Avenue!
28,Rachel," Oh yeah, she can't be herself."
29,Phoebe," Okay, so... allright... Which dress? (she holds up 
  two 'Phoebe' dresses, Rachel and Monica look at them... taking their time, don't 
  wanting to hurt Phoebe) You can say ""neither""."
31,Monica," I'm sorry honey, but we're gonna take you shopping. 
  It's gonna be fine."
32,Rachel," Yeah, totally! You are in such good hands. And I'm 
  so good with meeting parents. With the father, you know, you want to flirt a 
  little bit, but not in a gross way. Just kind of like ""Oh mr. Pincer, 
  I can see where Wallis gets his good looks..."""
33,Monica, You went out with Wallis Pincer?
34,Rachel," Uh, he took the SAT's for me."
35,Monica, I knew you didn't get a 1400!
36,Rachel," Ssshyeah, well, duh! I mean..."
37,Phoebe, So... now... What about with Mike's mom?
38,Rachel," Oh, with the mother, just... just constantly tell 
  her how amazing her son is. Take it from me, moms love me. Ross's mom one time 
  actually said I'm like the daughter that she never had."
39,Monica,  (Monica looks at Rachel in disbelief) She said WHAT?
40,Phoebe," (speaking louder and articulating) That's she's like 
  the daughter she never had. (Phoebe points at her ears) Listen! (Monica looks 
  at Phoebe in a duh! way)"
42,Rachel, Hi.
43,Ross, Hi.
44,Rachel," I just finished getting Phoebe all dressed to meet 
  Mike's parents. She's so nervous, it's so sweet!"
45,Ross, Guess what? I made Emma laugh today.
46,Rachel," (in disbelief) You WHAT? And I missed it? Because 
  I was giving a makeover to that stupid hippie?"
47,Ross," Yeah, and it was uhm... it was like a real little person 
  laugh too. It was... it was like uhm... (Ross tries to impersonate Emma's laugh, 
  but it comes out very squeaky, very high pitched. He laughs about himself but 
  then looks at Rachel, realises that it sounded weird and straightens his face.) 
  Only... only not creepy."
48,Rachel," Well... well, what did you do to make her laugh? (excited)"
49,Ross," I uhm... Well, I sang... (Rachel gasps) well actually 
  I rapped... Baby Got Back... (Rachel's face changes from excited to angry)"
50,Rachel," You WHAT? You sang... to our baby daughter... a song 
  about a guy who likes to have sex with women with giant asses?"
51,Ross," But you know what, if you think about it, it actually 
  promotes a healthy uhm... body image... because... even big butts or uhm... 
  juicy doubles."
52,Rachel, (disgusted) owwwww...
53,Ross, Please don't take her away from me!
56,Joey, Hi I'm Joey. This is Chandler.
57,Chandler," So how come Richard's selling the place? Went bankrupt? 
  Medical malpractice? Choked on his own moustache?"
59,Chandler, mmm That's enough about you!
60,Joey, Is there anything we should know about the apartment?
62,Chandler," No, no, no, no, no, NO! No, no... we're not together. 
  We're not a couple. We're definately not a couple."
64,Joey," Well, you seem pretty insulted by that. What? I'm not 
  good enough for you? "
65,Chandler," We're not gonna have this conversation again... 
  Look at this place. Why am I so intimidated by this guy? Pretentious art, this 
  huge macho couch. When we know all he does is sit around all day crying about 
  losing Monica to a real man! (laughs) You don't think he's here, do you? (Joey 
  looks around)"
66,Joey," You know what it is? It's a nice place but I gotta see 
  I don't know if I see myself living here. Oh, oh, oh, let me see... (Joey sits 
  down on the couch, mimes opening a can and puts his hand down his pants) Yeah, 
  I could see it."
67,Chandler," (Chandler looks around the place and his eye gets 
  caught by Richard's video collection) Look at these videos. You know, I mean, 
  who does he think he is? Magnum Force, Dirty Harry, Cool Hand Luke... Oh my 
  God!"
68,Joey, What?
69,Chandler, There's a tape here with Monica's name on it.
70,Joey," Ooh! A tape with a girls name on it. It's probably a 
  sex tape... (realises) Wait a minute... This says Monica... (looks around) And 
  this is Richard's apartment... (realises some more)"
71,Chandler, Get there faster! (Joey gasps and finally understands...)
74,Phoebe, I'm wearing pantyhose!
76,Phoebe," Oh, thank you! Oh... Oh my God, you're RICH!"
78,Phoebe," Yeah, so... They gotta die someday. (Mike's parents 
  walk in) HELLO!"
80,Phoebe," (in a very posh accent) Theodore... Bitsy... What 
  a delight!"
82,Phoebe, And you... Your home is lovely.
84,Phoebe, Holy crap!
86,Phoebe," Oh, try and stop me!"
88,Phoebe," (no accent) I'm trying to get your parents to like 
  me."
90,Phoebe, (accent) Got it! It... It's hard to stop...
94,Phoebe," (no accent) Uhm... Okay, well, allright, uhm... Originally 
  I'm from upstate, but uhm... then my mom killed herself and my stepdad went 
  to prison, so... I just moved to the city where uhm... I actually lived in a 
  burned out Buick LeSabre for a while... (frowns are received) which was okay, 
  that was okay, until uhm... I got hepatitis, you know, 'cause this pimp spit 
  in my mouth and... but I... I got over it and uhm... anyway, now I'm uhm... 
  a freelance massage therapist, uhm... which, you know, isn't always steady money 
  but at least I don't pay taxes, huh... (everyone in the room finds it a bit 
  surreal, which Phoebe realises and starts to talk in the accent again) So... 
  where does everyone summer?"
97,Phoebe, God! God! This is not going well.
99,Phoebe," Okay, okay, okay, okay... Still sure about me being 
  myself?"
101,Phoebe," So Theodore... I uhm... I can see where Mike gets 
  his good looks from..."
103,Phoebe," Yeah... And that physique! You must work out all the 
  time..."
105,Phoebe," Yeah I bet! Look out! (Phoebe punches Theodore right 
  in the stomach)"
107,Phoebe," Oh my God, are you okay?"
109,Phoebe, I'm so sorry!
111,Phoebe," I really, really am sorry."
114,Phoebe," Yes... I'm sorry, I've never met a boyfriends parents 
  before..."
116,Phoebe," Yeah okay... yeah, your mom... okay... She looks nice, 
  I can talk to her."
118,Phoebe," Yeah... Oh Bitsy, hi. Uhm... listen I just wanted 
  to thank you again for having me here tonight."
120,Phoebe," Also uhm... I just want you to know what a wonderful 
  man your son is."
122,Phoebe," Well, and you know, it really is a testament to how 
  he was raised. Especially to you. Because he's very respectful of women."
124,Phoebe," Are you kidding. He is so considerate of my feelings 
  and... you know I think... you'd also like to know that he is a very gentle 
  lover."
126,Phoebe," (Mike now enters and stands behind Phoebe) Oh no, 
  no, no, no, no, no. Don't get me wrong. No, he's not in like a sissy way. No, 
  no, no... when he gets going, he can rattle a headboard like a sailor on leave..."
130,Chandler," I'm not gonna watch it... I don't NEED to watch 
  it... I mean, what good could possibly come from watching? (sighs) Well, we 
  know I'm gonna watch it. (Chandler moves to put the tape in the VCR and Joey 
  enters the apartment)"
131,Joey," Hey dude, what's up?"
132,Chandler," Don't judge me, I'm only human!"
133,Joey, Did you take that tape?
134,Chandler," I had to! Okay, imagine you were married... and 
  you found a tape of your wife in another guys' apartment... Wouldn't you need 
  to know what was on it?"
135,Joey, I don't know. Who'm I'm married to?
136,Chandler, Some girl...!?
137,Joey, She hot?
138,Chandler, Yeah...!?
139,Joey, How did she get me to settle down?
140,Chandler," Allright, I'm gonna watch it... I mean look, it's 
  probably not even what I think it is... And even if it is... It can't possibly 
  be as bad as what I'm picturing in my head... (laughs nervously) Can it?"
141,Joey," Guess I don't know. My experience if a girl says yes 
  to being taped... She doesn't say no to much else, I tell ya..."
142,Chandler, Then you're gonna have to watch it for me.
143,Joey, (backs off) What? Whoo... What?
144,Chandler," Just for a few seconds, so I can know what it is... 
  Please?"
145,Joey," All right, fine... But if I enjoy this, you have only 
  yourself to blame... (Chandler turns his back to the TV. Joey puts the tape 
  in the VCR, switches it on and watches what's on the tape... It's clearly a 
  american football match, with the referee's whistle blowing, the crowds cheering...)"
146,Chandler, Why am I hearing cheering?
147,Joey," Well it's okay, its like... its just a football game."
148,Chandler, Football? Just football?
149,Joey," Yeah, see... you were all worried for nothing."
150,Chandler," It's football... It's just football... This is great! 
  This is the first time I've ever enjoyed football... It may be customary to 
  get a beer... (Chandler walks to the fridge, his back turned to the TV and a 
  moaning sound replaces the cheering of the crowd... Joey's eyes double in size...) 
  What the... (Chandler turns around, but Joey already took a sprint for Chandler, 
  jumps, and floors Chandler in the open space in front of the apartment door...) 
  What are you doing?"
151,Joey," You don't wanna see what I just saw! (at this moment 
  Monica comes home, and sees Chandler flat on his back on the floor and Joey 
  pinning him down)"
152,Monica," What are you guys doing? (Monica hears the moaning 
  coming from the TV and looks at it) Oh my God, is that Richard? (It only takes 
  a split second for Joey to realise, he pulls Monica down by her jacket, and 
  she falls, face down next to Chandler. Chandler gets up a bit, and Joey quickly 
  covers Chandler's eyes with his hand.)"
154,Rachel," Okay... aahhh... Please laugh for mommy... Please? 
  Please laugh for mommy... (Rachel makes a funny face, sticking her tongue out, 
  making a farting noise and using her hands as antlers, wiggling her fingers... 
  No response from Emma...) Not funny huh? Oh so, is it... only offensive novelty 
  rap? Or maybe just, you know, rap in general? 'Cause mommy can rap... (Rachel 
  tries to rap and makes weird movements with her arms in the process.) My 
  name is mommy and I'm here to say / that all the babies are... Oh, I can't 
  rap... Allright sweetheart... This is only because I love you so much, and I 
  know that you're not gonna tell anybody... (Rachel's face is telling ""Oh 
  what am I doing? The things I have to go through... and she starts to rap) I 
  like... big butts and I cannot lie... / You other brothers can't deny... / when 
  a girl walks in with an itty bitty waist and a round thing in your face... (Emma 
  starts to laugh) Yes! Yes! Yes! YES! Oohhhhh! Oh! (Rachel now really gets into 
  it, and her insecure movements start getting better) I like big butts and 
  I cannot lie... / You other brothers can't deny... Oh Emma you're laughing! 
  Oh you are, you really do like big butts, don't you. Oh you beautiful little 
  weirdo... (Rachel picks up Emma and Ross now enters)"
155,Ross, Hey!
156,Rachel," Oh you missed it. She was laughing. Oh it was amazing. 
  It was amazing. It was the most beautiful, beautiful sound that..."
157,Ross," Oh I know, isn't it? Ooh... what'd you do to get her 
  to laugh?"
158,Rachel," Oh! You know, I just... couple of things I tried ... 
  I just sang a little doo... Itsy Bitsy Spider..."
159,Ross, You sang Baby Got Back didn't you?
160,Rachel, Nothing else worked. That girl is all about the ass...
162,Phoebe," ...and then it goes back to the chorus... Smelly 
  cat, Sme-lly ca-t / I-t's not your fau-lt. And that's the end of the song... 
  I realise that you didn't ask to hear it, but uhm... no-one had spoken in seventeen 
  minutes."
164,Phoebe," Oh, Pervert Parade?"
166,Phoebe," Oh, Ode To A Pubic Hair?"
168,Phoebe, Oh God! Is that veal?
171,Phoebe," Oh no, no, no, no... That's okay, that's okay... I 
  mean, I'm... I am a vegetarian... except for veal... Yeah no, veal I love..."
173,Phoebe," No, no, no, I actually it's any baby animals kittens, 
  fish babies... You know... especially veal... and this, this nice vein of fat 
  running through it... (she cuts the meat, picks it up with her fork and holds 
  it in front of her mouth, which she keeps closed, trying to overcome her vegetarian 
  thoughts... and... puts it in her mouth... Clearly not enjoying the meat...) 
  Hmmm... yummy (everybody seems okay with it, except Mike. He's making a hmmmm.... 
  face... Then Phoebe swallows it) Hmmm... (at first she likes it, but then, in 
  an instant puts her hand in front of her mouth and runs from the table. You 
  hear a door slamming.)"
176,Monica, So you stole that tape from Richard's apartment?
177,Chandler," Whoho ho... Listen to the judgement from the porn 
  star!"
178,Monica," That tape was never meant to be seen by... (pauses) 
  Joey I would feel more comfortable if I was having this conversation in private. 
"
179,Joey," (laughs) Monica, look... I don't think you and I have 
  any secrets anymore... (Monica keeps looking at Joey) Not ready to joke about 
  it yet, okay, I see you later. (Joey walks out)"
180,Monica," Why in the world would you take this tape and and 
  why would you watch it?"
181,Chandler," Because that's who I am, okay? I'm sure a mature 
  man like Richard could see a tape like that and it wouldn't bother him. Just'd 
  be another saucy anecdote for him to share at his men's club over brandy and 
  moustaches."
182,Monica, Is all this about you not being able to grow a moustache?
183,Chandler," This is about you and Richard. He's clearly not 
  over you. He keeps a tape so he can... look at it whenever he wants."
184,Monica," Isn't that sad? I mean, can you see how pathetic that 
  is? You shouldn't be jealous. You should feel bad for him."
185,Chandler," Oh, yeah, well, poor Richard. Y'... I can grow a 
  moustache!"
186,Monica," Chandler, this is not our problem. We've got each 
  other. That's all that matters."
187,Chandler," Yeah, oh, but I just keep picturing you rolling 
  around with him with your cowboy boots in the air..."
188,Monica," Cowboy boots? I've never worn cowboy boots in my whole 
  life! (she turns on the video again)"
189,Chandler," Oh, good, good. Play more, 'cause I wanna see how 
  it ends."
190,Monica, THAT'S NOT ME!
191,Chandler," What...? That's not you! Life is good again! Ride 
  'em cowgirl!"
192,Monica," That bastard taped over me! (Chandler's expression 
  changes)"
193,Chandler, Is that a problem? 
194,Monica," I-It's just so insulting! Big spring for a new blank 
  tape, Doctor!"
209,Phoebe, Yeah... The woman you what?
211,Phoebe, I love you too... 
213,Phoebe, YEAH...! How great is this...? (they kiss)
215,Phoebe, Okay.
217,Phoebe," I had a great time. (accent) It was really top drawer. 
  And here's something rich thirteen bathrooms in this place... I threw up in 
  the coat closet... Ta taaa..."
220,Ross," She sweat, wet. got it going like a turbo 'vette."
221,Rachel, So fellas
222,Ross, Yeah!
223,Rachel, fellas
224,Ross, Yeah!
225,Rachel, has your girlfriend got the butt?
226,Ross, Hell yeah!
227,Rachel," So shake it! (Rachel slaps Ross's butt on 
  the beat)"
228,Ross, Shake it!
229,Rachel," Shake it!  (Phoebe, Mike, Chandler, Monica 
  and Joey step in)"
230,Ross, Shake it!
231,Rachel, Shake that nasty butt...
232,Ross," Baby got back (Then Ross turns around and sees 
  their friends standing in the doorway)"
233,Rachel," One more time from the top... I like big butts 
  and I cannot lie, you other br... (She also turns and sees the gang)"
234,Ross, Rachel please! That is so inappropriate!
0,Monica," Hey Hon, could you help me get the plates down?"
1,Chandler," Yeah. Hey, here's an idea, why don't we use our
  wedding china today?"
2,Monica," No, I think we should save our china for something
  really special. Like if the Queen of England comes over."
3,Chandler," Honey, she keeps canceling on us, take the hint. "
4,Monica," What if something gets broken, they're so expensive. "
5,Chandler," What is the point of having them if we never use
  them?"
6,Monica," Ok, but if something gets broken, and then the Queen
  comes over.."
7,Chandler, I will explain it to her.
8,Monica," <laughs> Oh yeah, like I'm going to let you
  talk to the queen. "
9,Joey," wow, the parade is really good this year. Man those
  horses can crap. "
11,Chandler," Muskogee! That's like four hours from Tulsa. Woo
  hoo!
  TV announcer And heres the float with the stars of the popular daytime soap
  Days of Our Lives ."
13,Joey, Oh my God!
14,Chandler," Aren't you one of the stars of the popular daytime
  soap Days of Our Lives? "
15,Joey," Yeah! I totally forgot I'm supposed to be there. I
  can't believe I forgot. I usually write stuff like this on my arm. "
18,Chandler, What are you going to do?
19,Joey," I guess I'm going to have to come up with a really
  good reason why I wasn't there. The producers are going to be so mad at me.
  They sat us all down yesterday and said ""Everyone has to be there at 600
  AM sharp, that means you Tribbiani."" Like.. like I was some kind of idiot. "
20,Chandler, Well you proved them wrong.
27,Ross," A lot of people are thankful for those.
< knock on door> "
29,Rachel, Who is it? 
33,Rachel, Hide my rings.
35,Rachel," Oh. <opens door preparing herself and then happily
  says> 
  Amy! Happy Thanksgiving."
37,Rachel, Um... hi.
39,Rachel, Aw. 
42,Rachel, I haven't seen you in like.. a year.
44,Rachel, Oh well yeah me too. Um.. I had a baby. 
46,Rachel," Oh.. yeah? Well unless you pushed a desk out of your
  vagina, <shakes head no> not the same thing."
50,Rachel, mh hmm.. 
52,Rachel, Uh.... its Emma.
55,Ross, Hey Amy. 
56,Rachel," Oh Amy, you remember Ross."
58,Ross, That was me.
65,Monica," Careful. <hands Chandler a china plate> Careful.
  CAREFUL! "
67,Chandler," I'll tell you what, for the rest of our lives,
  I'll be careful until told otherwise. <looks at china> hey wait a minute
  this isn't the china we picked out.. "
68,Monica," I know, after you left the store, I chose different
  ones."
69,Chandler, Why?
70,Monica," well no offense honey, but your taste is a little
  feminine for me."
71,Chandler," Oh suddenly, flowers are feminine?
< Phoebe comes in>"
72,Phoebe," Hey, everybody. Happy Thanksgiving!"
73,Joey," Hey happy Thanksgiving.. Pheebs! <motions her to
  come over> "
74,Phoebe," Hey, what's going on Joe? "
75,Joey, I.. I.. I need a good lie.
76,Phoebe," Oh okay. How about the whole ""man walking on
  the moon"" thing. You know? You. you could. You could see the strings people! "
77,Joey," No, no, no I need a good lie to explain why I wasn't
  at a work thing today."
78,Phoebe," Ooh, honey. You stink at lying. "
79,Joey, I do not.
80,Phoebe," Oh really. Okay. let me ask you something. Yesterday
  at the coffee house, I went to the bathroom and when I came back, my muffin
  was gone-who took it?"
81,Joey," Somebody opened the door to the coffee house and a
  raccoon came running in, went straight for your muffin and I said ""Hey
  don't eat that-that's Phoebe's"" and he said.. <pause> He said.. ""Joey
  you stink at lying."" What am I going to do? "
82,Phoebe," Don't worry, don't worry. We'll come up with a good
  lie. I'll help you practice it."
83,Joey," Oh great, that'd be great. Thank you. "
84,Phoebe," Sure, what.. what was the work thing? "
85,Joey," Uh.. <forgetting what the work thing was, rolls
  up his sleeve on his right arm and shows Phoebe, she looks>"
86,Phoebe," ""Pick up grandma at the airport""?"
87,Joey, Oh.. man..
90,Rachel," Amy! <pause> Yes I do.. I really do. <grabs
  Ross' hand for support>"
93,Ross," Sure, we don't live there but..."
95,Rachel," Yeah, no. Ross has a PhD."
97,Rachel, God she is unbelievable.
98,Ross," I know, I mean a PhD is just as good as an MD."
99,Rachel," Oh sure Ross, yeah. If I have a heart attack in a
  restaurant, I want you there with your fossil brush. "
101,Rachel, What? What happened? 
103,Ross, Don't say that.
105,Rachel," Oh Amy, don't cry Amy.  Um.. Ross, could I talk
  to you in private?"
106,Ross," Sure, you want to go upstairs?"
108,Rachel," Um look I was thinking.. If its ok with Monica I
  would like to invite Amy to Thanksgiving."
109,Ross," You know, I think thats a great idea. It'll be like
  the pilgrims bringing the Indians syphilis."
110,Rachel," Look I know she's a little tough to take. She has
  no where else to go, and she's my sister. Alright, she's Emma's aunt. And I
  would like them to bond. "
111,Ross," Ok, fine, but I don't want them bonding to much. I
  don't want her telling Emma she needs a nose job. "
112,Rachel," Ross, you know what? She may need one..We're just
  going to have to make our peace with that! "
117,Rachel," Hey you guys, this is my sister Amy.  This is
  Chandler, Joey, Phoebe and you know Mon. "
133,Joey," Pheebs, I still need some help here"
134,Phoebe," Oh right, ok um. Ok so its not just the lie you tell.
  but its the way you tell it. . For example if you look down at the ground when
  you're talking, people know you're lying. "
135,Joey," Oh.. I don't know why this is so hard for me. you know..
  I mean lying is basically just acting and I am a terrfic actor. "
139,Rachel, Oh we just put her down for a nap.
143,Phoebe, Thats a great movie. <she claps>
146,Ross, Emma. 
148,Phoebe, PHOE-BE.
150,Rachel," Honey, I don't know how to tell you this, but um,
  if something were to happen to Ross or to myself <Ross and Rachel knock
  on wood> um you wouldn't get the baby. "
152,Ross," Well we haven't offically asked them yet, but we would
  want Monica and Chandler. "
153,Chandler, I can't believe you'd want us to raise Emma. 
154,Monica," yeah oh my god, I'm so moved. "
156,Rachel," See look Amy, we're a lot closer to Monica and Chandler.
  We see them every day. And truthfully honey, you don't seem very connected
  to the baby."
158,Chandler," You know, guys I got to say. This means so much
  to me. That you would trust me with your child. I mean, we all know that Monica
  and I have been trying to have a baby of our own. You know I've had my doubts
  about my skills as a father, but that you two.. that you two.... <starts
  to cry>"
161,Monica," Okay! It's time for dinner. Everyone we're using
  our fancy china.. um and its very expensive so please be careful."
163,Monica," Okay, just to be clear comedy with the plates will
  not be well recieved. <pinches Ross' arm>"
165,Joey," Hey! How come my plate's less fancy then everyone else's?
  Do you not trust me with a fancy plate? "
166,Monica," No, honey, its. thats a special plate.  See
  its a game, whoever gets that plate wins. "
167,Joey, I can't believe I won.
169,Rachel, Monica is Ross' sister. 
171,Monica, That was me. 
173,Rachel, Hey. Amy. You've got to stop doing that.
177,Monica," Now see, this way you protect the plate.. and lets
  face it you have fun. "
179,Chandler," No, if crazy plate lad.. <sees Monica frustrated
  at this comment> If Monica dies then I would get Emma, Right?"
181,Rachel, Well actually...
182,Chandler, Actually what? 
183,Ross," well.. its just. its just in that case, then um. Emma
  would go to my parents. "
184,Chandler, What?
190,Chandler," So if Monica's not around, then I'm not good enough
  to raise Emma? "
192,Joey, Yeah he's lying. He looked down. 
194,Chandler," Well what is wrong with me? Am I .. am I incomptent?
  Because I managed to survive whatever it is that killed the three of you! "
195,Rachel," Honey, you're taking this the wrong way. We think
  you're going to be a wonderful parent. It's just.. you're more the fun parent. "
196,Ross," Yeah and we'd want to make sure Emma has someone like
  Monica who is more uh. uh discliplinarin.. someone who can be firm and strict. "
197,Monica," Thats not how you see me, is it? "
199,Chandler," Look, I may not know a lot about babies, but do
  you really think I'm not capable? "
200,Ross," No, you both are equally capable. Its just.. you're
  strongest when.. when you're together. "
201,Chandler," Ok. So if we both had Emma and I die <knocks
  on table>  she'd have to give her up. "
202,Ross," Sure, Monica would have to give her up. "
203,Joey," I lie better then that, right?"
204,Chandler," So.. let me get this straight. So my two friends
  die, I get Emma. Then my wife dies, then Emma the one tiny ray of hope left
  in my life gets taken away from me?"
205,Phoebe, There's your movie! <claps> 
208,Monica, Hey. There you are. You disappeared after dinner. 
209,Chandler," Oh? Did somebody miss me? Is there a child to raise
  poorly? "
210,Monica," Ross and Rachel don't know what they're talking about.
  I mean its not like their so responsible. Emma is a product of a bottle of
  Merlot and a five year old condom. "
211,Chandler," Yeah but they're right. I mean, I'm not a strong
  father figure and I never will be. "
212,Monica, No you learn these things. You grow into it.
213,Chandler," Yeah, but its not who I am. Everything they said
  was exaclty why I was worried about having a kid. And its true. And look everybody
  knows it. "
214,Monica," I don't know it! I want to have a kid with you because
  I think you're going to be an amazing dad... at the fun parts and the hard
  parts. "
215,Chandler," Oh yeah, well can you picture me saying ""Go
  to your room! You're grounded""? "
216,Monica," Can you hear me say ""You're grounded""?"
217,Chandler, You said that to me last week. 
218,Monica, How hard is it? No shoes on the furniture. 
222,Phoebe," It's ok. I thought of the perfect lie for you. It's
  easy to remember and doesn't invite a lot of questions. You weren't at the
  parade because you had a family emergency. "
223,Joey," Oh, I like that, yeah. Wasn't at the parade because
  I had a family emergency."
224,Phoebe," Ooh, what happened? "
226,Phoebe, No! Nothing with a raccoon. 
227,Joey," Arg... Alright, I'll take care of it. <throws hands
  out in the air>"
229,Monica, Oh wait.. What are you doing? 
230,Joey, Setting the table. 
231,Phoebe," Yeah we thought it would be nice to use the fancy
  china for dessert too. "
232,Monica," Oh how nice. Maybe later we can all go blow our noses
  on my wedding dress. "
234,Ross," Hey dude, you okay? Sorry about before."
235,Chandler," Oh no thats okay, you're totally right. I don't
  know anything about disciplining a child. But it did hurt my feelings and I
  want you to know that when I die, you don't get Joey. "
238,Rachel, UCHH! <much louder and longer then Amy's>
240,Rachel," Yeah.. yeah right.. Remember in high school when
  I died and didn't give you my baby?"
242,Rachel, What? What carrer? 
244,Rachel," Ok. You decorate dad's office and so now you're a
  decorator. Okay! I went to the zoo yesterday and now I'm a koala bear. "
246,Rachel," Sup.. You want to talk supportive? You didn't even
  come and visit me when I was in the hospital having the baby. "
248,Rachel," I did the first time! Oh. Oh.. <gets up and walks
  into the kitchen> And you know what. You want to know why I'm not giving
  Emily to you."
249,Ross, Emma. 
252,Joey, ooh oooh.. 
254,Rachel, uh huh.
256,Rachel," Jealous of what? Of your lack of responsiblity? You,
  your immaturity? Your total disregard of other people's feelings? "
258,Rachel, Timmy was my boyfriend and you made out with him!
260,Rachel," I cannot, I cannot believe that I invited you here
  today."
262,Rachel," ah ha ha. ah ha ha. <evil meancing laughter> It's
  forty five. "
266,Rachel, You take that back.
268,Rachel, Take it back!
270,Rachel," Heey man, I work out. "
273,Rachel, I do pilates. 
275,Rachel, Bring it on! 
277,Monica," Put the plates in the boxes!! Put the plates in the
  boxes! "
278,Rachel, Did you just push me?
280,Rachel, Alright. Thats it! <Pushes Amy back> 
285,Phoebe, Oh my god! Shouldn't we stop this?
286,Joey," What? Are you out of your mind? Lets throw some jello
  on them. "
288,Rachel, Ew! Gross. 
291,Chandler," Alright! That is it. This is our apartment and
  you can not behave this way. Now if you can't act your age then you shouldn't
  be here at all. Now those plates may not be as nice as the pretty pink ones
  I picked out, but they're very important to Monica. I want you to apologize
  to her right now. "
293,Rachel," Mon, I'm so sorry. "
294,Chandler," Okay. Thats better. Now I want you to both apologize
  to each other and mean it. "
296,Chandler," By the way, that fight was totally arousing. "
297,Ross," Dude. Well done. You know what? If I die, and Rachel
  dies and Monica dies then you can totally take care of Emma. "
298,Chandler, Oh yeah? Well thanks. 
299,Ross," So, so now do I get Joey?"
300,Chandler," Okay, but you should know he eats five times a
  day and shoves pennies up his nose. "
302,Rachel, Are you okay Mon? 
303,Monica," uh huh.. I mean these things happen. Its' just a
  plate. Its not like somebody died. "
304,Phoebe, It's all right. You can mourn. 
306,Joey," Actually its not pies, its just pie. "
307,Monica," I don't care. <pauses and realizes...> Oh my
  god. I've lost the will to scold. "
308,Rachel," Look Amy, it got a little of control..Um.. and I'm
  sorry. You're my sister and uh.. if it really means that much to you.. "
310,Rachel," Uh. No.. I was going to let you use my Ralph Lauren
  discount. "
313,Rachel, She needs changing.
314,Chandler," Oh no no no.. I'll get her. I'm super-compentent
  and totally responsibile and fourth in line to raise Emma. I'll be right there
  Emma. Just let me get my trusty diaper bag here. <knocks over the box of
  china> Well.. what do you know? I guess, I'll be the one who dies first."
317,Phoebe," Hey, does Monica know about her broken plates yet?"
318,Chandler, Nope...
319,Phoebe," Broke them all, huh?"
320,Chandler, Yep...
321,Phoebe, You gonna tell her?
322,Chandler," Nope... (Monica walks in) Hey... so I'm gonna...
  put the plates back. You know, I think you were right, I don't think we should
  use these plates again for a looong time."
323,Monica, Like only if the queen comes?
324,Chandler, Maybe not even then. (Joey walks in)
325,Joey," Hey! I did it. I called my producer. I told him I had
  a family emergency, he totally bought it. Thanks for teaching me how to lie
  Pheebs."
326,Phoebe," No problem! Next week stealing... (Chandler walks
  away to store the box of broken china.)"
327,Monica, Bye plates!
328,Joey," Oh, you told her you broke all the plates, huh? (Chandler
  walks back, looking angrily at Joey)"
329,Monica, What? Something happened with the plates?
330,Joey," Uhm... (looks down) Yeah... this uhm... raccoon came
  in..."
0,Phoebe," ...sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle;and away they all flew like the down of a thistle; but I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight, ""Merry Christmas to all, and to all a goodnight!"""
1,Joey," (impressed) Wow, that was great! You really wrote that?"
2,Phoebe, (smiling) Uh-huh.
3,Chandler," (coming from the bedroom) Say goodbye elves, I'm off to Tulsa."
4,Monica, I can't believe you're not gonna be here for Christmas.
5,Ross, You're really not coming back?
6,Chandler," Yeah, we have all this paperwork that needs to be filed by the end of the year. If I don't get it done, I'll be fired."
7,Monica," It's so unfair, you don't even like your job!"
8,Chandler," So, who does?"
9,Phoebe," Oh, I like my job."
10,Joey, I *love* my job.
11,Rachel," Yeah, I can't *wait* to go back to work."
12,Ross, I can't get *enough* dinosaurs!
13,Chandler," I'm sorry, I won't be here."
14,Monica," It's just... It's hard enough not seeing you during the week, but for Christmas... alright, if this is what you have to do, I understand."
15,Chandler, Thanks. (they kiss) I'll see you New Year's Day.
16,Monica, (shocked) You're not gonna be here New Year's Eve??
17,Chandler, Did I not mention that?
18,Monica, No!
19,Chandler," (thinks for a second, then waves his arms, exclaiming) AND TO ALL A GOOD NIGHT! (and runs out of the apartment)"
22,Chandler," All right everybody, I know that it's Christmas Eve and you'd rather be with your families, but there's *no* call (he takes it off) for writing ""Screw you, Mr. Bing!"" on the back of my chair! (he looks at it) -- By the way, you can all call me Chandler."
26,Chandler, Hey. Where've you been?
28,Chandler," (to the others) You hear that? You may not be with your families, but at least it's gonna smell like ham in here."
30,Chandler," Y'know what, I know what will cheer you guys up! (he starts spreading envelopes among them) I had a little talk with the boys in New York, told 'em about all the hard work you've been doing and that a little Christmas bonus may be in order."
32,Chandler," Well, that's like money in your pocket! - Alright look, you want me to say it? This sucks. Being here sucks! This work sucks!"
34,Chandler," I'm sorry. Hey, at least you guys get to go home and be with your families tonight. I have to go back to an empty hotel room and lay down on a very questionable bedspread. And then tomorrow morning, you get to have Christmas morning in your own houses, wich, by the way, none of you have invited me to."
36,Chandler," Haha, no thanks!"
38,Chandler," Oh, thanks! I'm... actually thinking about becoming a motivational speaker."
40,Chandler," Typical Christmas-y stuff, you know? Our holidays are pretty traditional..."
42,Phoebe," So here is a, a very special holiday song that I wrote for some very important people to me. (singing)"
47,Rachel," Okay, Pheebs, you look in the kitchen, I will look in the back closet."
48,Chandler," I can save you time ladies, I'm right here."
49,Phoebe," Yeah, Chandler why don't you take a walk? This doesn't concern you."
50,Rachel, We are looking for our Christmas presents from Monica.
51,Chandler, What? That's terrible!
52,Phoebe," No-no, we do it every year!"
53,Chandler," Oh well, that, that makes it not terrible."
54,Phoebe," No, yeah, we never find them! She's always best at us, that wily... minx."
55,Rachel," Don't worry, we're just gonna search here for an hour, and then we're gonna go over to Joey's and search, OK?"
56,Chandler," No not okay, you can't look for Monica's presents!"
57,Phoebe," Oh no, we have to!"
58,Chandler," No, you don't have to, and you can't because I, I live here too."
59,Phoebe," Well then, you should look with us."
60,Chandler, Why?
61,Rachel," Chandler, aren't you worried about what to get Monica for Christmas?"
62,Chandler," No, I have a great idea for a present for her."
63,Phoebe," Oh, that's it? (Mimics Chandler) A great idea! Oh yeah."
64,Rachel," Chandler, that's not enough. I mean what if she gets you a great present, two medium presents, and a bunch of little presents? And you've just gotten her one great present? I mean that's just gonna make her feel bad. Why would you do that to her Chandler? Why? Why?"
65,Chandler," If I help, we can find 'em faster!"
66,Rachel, That's right!
68,Phoebe," Ooh ooh, we have a live one!"
69,Rachel," Oh, it's a Macy's bag!"
71,Rachel, Oh.
72,Phoebe," Ooh, who's it for?"
73,Rachel," (Reading from a tag that's attached to the shoe) ""Dear losers, do you really think I'd hide presents under the couch? P.S. Chandler, I knew they'd break you."""
75,Joey," Rach, these are for you."
76,Rachel, Wiper blades. I don't even have a car.
77,Joey," No, but with this new car smell, you'll think you do."
78,Chandler," OK, Pheebs, your turn."
79,Phoebe," Ahh, toilet seat covers! Is that what you were doing while I was getting gas?"
80,Joey, Uh-huh.
81,Phoebe, You guuuyys.
82,Joey," And for Ross, Mr. Sweet-tooth."
83,Ross, You got me a cola drink?
84,Chandler," And, a lemon lime."
85,Ross," Well this, this is too much, I feel like I should get you another sweater."
86,Chandler, And last but not least.
88,Joey, They're ribbed for *your* pleasure.
90,Ross," Ooh, hey Ben, what if the Holiday Armadillo told you all about the Festival of Lights?"
92,Ross, Yeah!
93,Monica, Come on Ben.
95,Ross, Years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees...
96,Chandler," (entering in a Santa costume) Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!"
98,Chandler, Hey! (Grunts as Ben hits him at full speed.)
99,Ross," What are you doing here, Santa?"
100,Chandler," Well, I'm here to see my old buddy Ben. What are you doing here, weird...turtle-man?"
101,Ross," I'm the Holiday Armadillo, your part-Jewish friend. You sent me here to give Ben some presents. Remember?"
102,Chandler, What?
103,Monica," Okay Ben, why don't you come open some more presents, and Santa, the Armadillo and I have a little talk in the kitchen? There's a sentence I'd never thought I'd say."
105,Ross, (to Chandler) What are you doing?
106,Chandler," You called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a Santa costume, so I borrowed one from a guy at work!"
107,Ross," Thank you, but, but you, you gotta leave."
108,Chandler, Why?
109,Ross," Because, I'm finally getting him excited about Hanukkah, and, and you're-you're wrecking it."
110,Chandler, But I didn't get to shake my belly like a bowl full of jelly.
111,Ross," I'm sorry Chandler, but this, this is really important to me."
112,Chandler," Fine, I'll give the suit back."
114,Monica," (to Chandler) Hey, you think, you can keep it another night? (She has a really teasing look on her face and keeps twirling Chandler's beard.)"
115,Chandler, Santa? Really?
116,Monica," Yeah, is that okay?"
117,Chandler, Did your Dad ever dress up like Santa?
118,Monica, No.
119,Chandler, Then it's okaaay! (They kiss.)
121,Chandler," You know what, everybody? Go home. You should be with your families. It's bad enough that we're working New Year's Eve."
123,Chandler," Did I not tell *anyone* about New Year's Eve? -- Alright, look, go! Go home, okay? Merry Christmas! Go."
125,Chandler," Good, God's speed, good people! (he starts to close the door, turns around and sees Wendy) You're not gonna go?"
127,Chandler, Ah. Thanks.
129,Chandler, Ah. (The phone rings; he answers it) Chandler Bing.
131,Monica, Hi Honey! We're all here; we just want to wish you a Merry Christmas.
133,Phoebe, (simultaneous to the others) Ble-blah-blar Blargh!
135,Chandler," Ahh, Merry Christmas; I miss you guys!"
136,Monica, So is it horrible? Is everybody working really hard?
137,Chandler," Ah, well no, it's just uh, me and Wendy."
138,Monica, Wendy? -- That sounds like a girl's name.
139,Chandler, It is. Did I... not tell you about her?
140,Monica," Umhmm, umhmm, about the time you told me about New Year's Eve. Where is everybody else?"
141,Chandler, I sent them home.
142,Monica," Ohh, you are such a good boss! Is she pretty?"
143,Chandler," Uhh, uh..."
144,Ross," (in a low voice) Answer faster, answer faster!"
145,Chandler, I don't know!
146,Ross," (in the same low voice) Answer better, answer better!"
147,Chandler," I don't think of her that way, you know, she's a, she's a colleague."
148,Monica, What does she do there?
149,Chandler," Oh, she's regional Vice President; She's... just below me."
150,Monica, She did WHAT?
151,Chandler, BE-LOW me!
152,Joey," Ahh, wait, is Wendy the runner-up Miss Oklahoma?"
153,Monica, *What*??
154,Chandler," Well, she... she didn't win..."
155,Monica," Alright, well, maybe I should let you and the second prettiest girl in Oklahoma get back to work."
156,Chandler," Well, second prettiest that year; I mean, of *all* the girls in Oklahoma, she's probably..."
157,Rachel," (interrupting him) Oh Chandler, stop talking!"
158,Chandler," Honey, there's really nothing to worry about."
159,Monica, Okay.
160,Chandler, I'm serious!
161,Monica, Okay!
162,Chandler, Merry Christmas.
163,Monica, Merry Christmas.
164,Chandler," Merry Christmas, you guys!"
166,Phoebe," (simultaneous to the others) Blah blargah, blar-blab."
169,Chandler," (hanging up the phone) The wife says ""Hi!""."
171,Chandler," Ah well, she's got this weird idea, that, uh, y'know, just because you and I are alone, that something is gonna happen."
173,Chandler," This is probably the wrong thing to be worrying about, but... you're getting ham on my only tie."
176,Chandler," Whoa-ho, back off, Missy! (He takes a step back, but she still keeps her grip on his tie.)"
178,Chandler, I don't know; I'm not used to girls making passes at me! ... (She lets go of his tie) Wait a minute... am I sexy in Oklahoma?
180,Chandler," (flattered) No,... no... (realizing) NO! (He quickly gets several steps away from her.) Look, I'm, I'm married!"
182,Chandler, I'm *happily* married.
184,Chandler," Right. So, I'm sorry..."
186,Chandler," Well look, it's not easy to spend this much time apart, you know. She's entitled to be a little paranoid... or, in this case right on money! ... You know, she's amazing, and beautiful, and smart, and if she were here right now, ...she'd kick your ass. Look, you're a really nice person... ham stealing and adultery aside. But, what I have with my wife is pretty great, so nothing is ever gonna happen between us."
190,Chandler," I mean, you were the most beautiful woman in the room tonight!"
191,Monica, Really?
192,Chandler, You kidding? You're the most beautiful woman in most rooms... (She jumps up and kisses him.) (Breaking the kiss.) Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What's going on? You and I just made out! You and I are making out?
193,Monica," Well, not anymore."
194,Chandler, But we don't do that.
195,Monica," I know, I just thought it would be fun."
196,Chandler, How drunk are you?
197,Monica, Drunk enough that I know I wanna do this. Not so drunk that you should feel guilty about taking advantage.
198,Chandler, (thinks) That's the perfect amount!
199,Monica, Okay!
201,Monica, (breaking the kiss) Y'know what's weird?
202,Chandler, What?
203,Monica, This doesn't feel weird!
204,Chandler, I know.
205,Monica, You're a really good kisser.
206,Chandler," Well, I have kissed over four women. (They kiss again.) Do you wanna get under the covers?"
207,Monica, Hm-hmm!
208,Chandler, Okay!
210,Monica, Wow! You are really fast!
211,Chandler, It bodes well for me that speed impresses you.
212,Monica, We're gonna see each other naked.
213,Chandler, Yep!
214,Monica, Do you wanna do it at the same time?
215,Chandler, Count of three?
216,Monica, One!
217,Chandler, Two!
218,Monica, Two!
220,Chandler, Well I think it's safe to say that our friendship is effectively ruined.
221,Monica," Eh, we weren't that close anyway!"
222,Chandler, Eh! (They start making out again)
224,Chandler," So, are you really gonna go out with that nurse man?"
225,Monica," Well uh, you and I are just goofing around, I thought, why not just goof around with him."
226,Chandler," Y'know, I don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary... Well, I have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together. But if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to, y'know, get you my original dictionary. I am *so* bad at this."
227,Monica, I think you're better than you think you are.
228,Chandler," Really? Okay, so..."
229,Monica, (interrupting) Know when to stop.
230,Chandler," Y'know, I sensed that I should stop. So we're okay?"
231,Monica," Yeah. (They kiss and as she starts to leave, Chandler starts to dance. Without turning around) Don't do the dance."
232,Chandler, Right!
234,Monica," I can't get married until I get something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue."
235,Chandler," Okay, all right, all right, all right! Okay! (Picks up a blue sweater.) Okay, here's something, here's something blue and new."
236,Monica, You're so efficient. I love you!
237,Chandler, Let's go! (Starts to leave.)
238,Monica," No-no-no, wait! We need something old!"
239,Chandler," Oh, okay, I have condom in my wallet that I've had since I was twelve."
240,Monica, That'll work!
241,Chandler, I don't think so.
242,Monica," Okay, now we just need something borrowed!"
243,Chandler, (looks around) Here just...take this. (Hands her the sweater.)
244,Monica, That's stealing!
245,Chandler," No, we'll-we'll bring it back! Just put it under your dress."
247,Monica, Ohh. (Rubs her fake stomach.)
248,Chandler," Okay, one thing at a time. (They run out to get married.)"
250,Monica," Listen umm, I've been thinking, it's not fair for me to ask you to spend all of your money on our wedding. I mean, you work, you work really hard for that."
251,Chandler, Ehh.
252,Monica," Eh, you work for that."
253,Chandler," Look, I thought about it too, and I'm sorry. I think we should spend all of the money on the wedding."
254,Monica, You do?!
255,Chandler," Yeah, I'm putting my foot down. Yeah look, when I proposed I told you that I would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy, then, then that's what we're gonna do."
256,Monica," Oh, you're so sweet. (They hug and kiss.) Oh, but wait, what about our, what about the future and stuff?"
257,Chandler," Eh, forget about the future and stuff! So we only have two kids, y'know? We'll pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college."
258,Monica, You thought about that?
259,Chandler, Yeah.
260,Monica, How many kids were we gonna have?
261,Chandler," Uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy."
262,Monica, What else did you think about?
263,Chandler," Well, stuff like where we'd live, y'know? Like a small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. Y'know, we could have a cat that had a bell on its collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. Of course, we'd have an apartment over the garage where Joey could grow old."
264,Monica," (laughs) Y'know what? I-I don't want a big, fancy wedding."
265,Chandler, Sure you do.
266,Monica," No, I want everything that you just said. I want a marriage."
267,Chandler, You sure?
268,Monica, Uh-hmm.
269,Chandler, I love you so much.
270,Monica, I love you. (They kiss.)
272,Rachel," (opens her present from Ross; it's a dark-red scarf) Oohh, I love it!"
273,Ross, Really? You're not gonna return it?
274,Rachel," Well, not this second!"
275,Phoebe," (at the window) Hey look, you guys, it's snowing!"
277,Rachel," Oh wow, it's so beautiful..."
278,Ross," Wow, it really is!"
280,Monica," ""Wendy"" is a fat girl name."
281,Phoebe, Aren't we done with that?
282,Monica," Okay, fine. Let's talk about snow. -- Do you think it's snowing in Tulsa, where my husband is having sex on a copying machine?"
284,Chandler, Hey!
286,Ross, Oh my god...
287,Joey," Hey-heeyyy - Look at that, it's a Christmas miracle!"
288,Monica, What are you doing here?
289,Chandler, I wanted to be with you. I missed you so much.
290,Joey," Hey, hey, uh, who did you miss the most?"
291,Chandler, Monica.
292,Joey, Got ya. (blinks an eye)
293,Chandler, I never want to leave you again!
294,Monica," But I thought if you left, you get fired."
295,Chandler, Turns out they can't fire me. Because I quit.
296,Monica, What?
297,Ross," What, you, you really quit your job?"
298,Chandler," Yeah! It's a stupid job, and I could not stand leaving you. And why should I be the only one who doesn't get to do what he *really* wants to do?"
299,Rachel, What do you really want to do?
300,Chandler, (realizing) I have *not* thought this through!
301,Monica, Oh my god!
302,Chandler," I know, I, I should have talked to you first about it."
303,Monica," No, I think that this is what you wanna do, I think it's great!"
304,Chandler, Thanks!
305,Phoebe," Chandler, your being here is the best Christmas present I could have ever imagined."
306,Chandler, (flattered) Ahh...
307,Phoebe, Now give me my real gift.
309,Phoebe, (to Chandler) Thank you.
310,Chandler," (to Monica) Here, pass these, will ya.. (points to the others)"
312,Ross," Oh, hey..."
314,Ross," (reading off his card) ""A donation has been made in your name to the New York City Ballet."" -- How did you know?"
315,Rachel, Wha... are you kidding? I can't return this.
316,Chandler," I... thought it was a timely start to thinking about other people. Besides, this gift still says I love you guys."
317,Joey, Mine's is to Lilian Myers.
318,Chandler, I don't have a *job*!
321,Chandler," Actuary... no. Book-keeper... no. Topless dancer... (he looks down on himself, checking, then nods satisfied and marks the offer with a pen) (to Monica) Hey, d'you know what I just realized? You are the sole wage earner. *You* are the head of the household. I don't do anything - I'm a kept man!"
322,Monica," You are! (she picks up a bill from the table, handing it to Chandler) Hey, here's twenty bucks. -- Why don't you go buy yourself something pretty while I'm at work tomorrow?"
1,Chandler, Hey
2,Joey, Hey. So where's Mon?
3,Chandler," Oh, she's at home, putting up decorations for Rachel's birthday party tonight."
4,Joey, And you're not helping?
5,Chandler," I tried, but apparantly singing ""I will survive"" in a helium voice 
  - not helping."
7,Ross, Hey you guys!
9,Rachel," Shhh don't say that loud, Gunther's gonna want to hug me."
10,Ross," Uh, good news everyone, we finally found a nanny. This is Molly (points 
  to Molly). Molly, Chandler, Joey."
14,Ross," Ooh, somebody's getting a little fussy."
15,Joey," You damn right I am, I've been waiting for a cookie for 7 minutes."
16,Rachel," Ok, you know what, I'm just gonna take her outside."
18,Rachel," OK, thank you."
20,Joey," Yeah, you too."
22,Rachel," Oh, wow, Molly is just great!"
23,Ross, Yeah.
24,Chandler," Yes, Bravo on the hot nanny."
25,Rachel, What? You really think she's hot?
26,Chandler, Are you kidding? If I wasn't married she'd be rejecting me right now.
27,Rachel, And Joey?
28,Joey, How do you think she's doing?
29,Rachel, Am I the only one who doesn't think that she's hot? Ross?
30,Ross," Eh, I mean, I mena she's not unattractive but hot? I ...."
31,Rachel, Thank you! (goes to get coffee)
32,Chandler, Now that Rachel's gone?
33,Rachel," So hot I cried myself to sleep last night. (Joey and Chandler clap their 
  hands)"
36,Phoebe," Hey Mike, what's the capital of Peru?"
38,Phoebe," No. It starts with a ""v"" and ends with an ""x"". Helpfully 
  with a ""to"" in the middle."
40,Phoebe, What?
42,Phoebe," (relived) Oh, whew, no, that's Bob."
44,Phoebe," Well not so much a pet as, you know, an occasional visitor who 
  I put food out for, you know. Kinda like Santa. Except Santa doesn't poop on 
  the plate of cookies."
46,Phoebe, What are those?
48,Phoebe," OK, fine, if it means that much to you I'll get rid of Bob."
50,Phoebe," So weird, you think he's so gross and you're willing to eat his crackers. 
  (Mike throws out everything in his mouth)"
52,Rachel, Hello.
54,Rachel," Gavin, I just wanted to say thank you again for watching Emma 
  yesterday during the presentation. I really owe you an appology."
56,Rachel," Well, when we first met, you know, I thought you were pompous 
  and arrogant and obnoxious ..."
58,Rachel," No, I just mean that, you know, first impressions don't mean anything. And 
  I-I think you're a really good guy and I'm sorry that I misjudged you."
61,Rachel," Hello. (to Gavin) But you know what, hey, new day, new leaf, 
  I am just really really happy ... (sees Gavin staring at Heather) I'm sorry, 
  obviously Heather's ass has something more important to say so I'll just wait 
  'till it's finished."
63,Rachel, I was giving you an appology and you were totally checking her out!
65,Rachel," Oh wow, you are really, you're really a creep."
67,Rachel," Oh yeah, I'm jealous. ""Oh Gavin, please, please look at 
  my ass"". (Gavin starts looking) Stop looking at my ass! I mean, I just 
  think you are totally inappropriate, ok? This is a work environment, she's your 
  subordinate."
69,Rachel," That is totally different for two reasons. One - I didn't know 
  that you knew that. And two, I wasn't some creep staring at his ass, we had 
  a deap meaningful relationship."
71,Rachel," It was ... (can't remember) oh my god. He didn't have a last 
  name. It was just ""Tag"". You know, like Cher, or, you know, Moses."
73,Rachel," Oh, you know what - my first impression of you was absolutely 
  right. You are arrogant, you are pompous ... Morgan! Morgan! Tag's last name 
  was Morgan! Huh!"
75,Rachel," Yeah well what are you, his boyfriend?"
77,Joey," Man, I wish I had a nanny like you."
79,Joey, Sure.
81,Monica, Would you stop staring at her?
82,Chandler, I wasn't staring. I was leering.
83,Monica," What's the big deal with her? Maybe she's attractive in an obvious kind 
  of way."
84,Ross," Yeah, obvious beauty's the worst. You know, when it's right there 
  in your face. Me, I like to have to work to find someone attractive. Makes me 
  feel like I earned it."
85,Chandler, Looks like Joey is doing allright with her.
86,Monica," Yeah. Hey, that was nice of you guys to back off and let Joey get the girl 
  for once."
88,Ross," Ok, I'll be home right after work. Ok, by Emma-Wemma-Demma, I love you 
  - wovyou dovyou ..."
90,Monica, They've elected me to talk to you about the baby talk - it's not so good.
93,Rachel," (to Joey) Hey, listen, Joey, about Molly, I really prefer if 
  you didn't go after her."
94,Joey, Why not?
95,Rachel," Because it took us months to find a good nanny and I wouldn't want anything 
  to, you know, drive her away."
96,Joey," So, what, you think I'm just gonna sleep with her and never call 
  her again and things are gonna get uncomfortable? (thinks about it) Yeah, sounds 
  about right."
97,Ross," Come on, there are plenty of other women out thereok? Just - just 
  forget about her, ok? Just, she's off limits."
98,Joey," Oh, man, why did have to go and say that for? Now that you told 
  me I can't have it makes me want her even more!"
99,Ross," What are you, a child?"
100,Joey, Yes!
101,Ross," Joey, come on now, for me! Please, just-just try to focus your sexual energy 
  on someone else."
102,Joey," Fine. (looks around, then focuses on Monica)"
103,Monica, (to Chandler) Take me home! (they quickly leave)
105,Phoebe, Hey Mikey
107,Phoebe, What are you doing?
109,Phoebe, To kill Bob??
111,Phoebe," No, Mike, I don't want to kill him! I thought we were just gonna 
  capture him and, and you know, set him free in the country side where he can 
  maybe meet a friendly possom and a wisecracking owl."
113,Phoebe," I'll find Bob, I'll get him. Bob? (starts looking) Bob! Robert! (looks at 
  cabinet under sink) Oh wait, I think I hear him. Oh - Oh my god! Bob had babies! 
  Bob's a mom!"
115,Phoebe," I don't know, I kinda like Bob for a girl."
117,Phoebe," Oh my god, we killed Bob!"
119,Phoebe, Suzie? (Runs over there to check)
121,Ross, Whazzup??
122,Chandler," Seriously dude, 3 years ago."
123,Ross," Listen, can you do me a favor? I'm gonna be out today. Can you just keep 
  an eye on Joey, make sure nothing happens between him and Molly?"
124,Chandler, You don't trust him?
125,Ross," Wh - No. Some woman who sounded a lot like Joey called earlier and asked 
  for her daughter, the ""hot nanny""."
126,Chandler," Is this really your long term plan, for me to run interference? 
  Because I could get a job any day now."
127,Ross," You do appear right on the cusp of something. Come on man, I'm 
  sure he'll lose interest in a week or two, but for now can you please just do 
  this for me?"
128,Chandler," Allright, fine, but don't blame me if it doesn't work. Because you know 
  as well as I do that once Joey sets his mind on something, more often than not, 
  he's going to have sex with it."
129,Ross," Well we gotta do something, ok? Nannies like her don't grow on trees. (pause) 
"
130,Chandler, Picturing that tree?
131,Ross," I am, yes."
133,Chandler," Where you going, Joe?"
135,Joey, For a walk.
136,Chandler, Oh. You mind if I join you?
137,Joey," Actually, that will be long. You know, I really need to organize 
  my thoughts."
138,Chandler, Your thoughts? Plural?
139,Joey," Allright, fine, I only have one thought! It's about the hot nanny, I gotta 
  see her!"
140,Chandler," I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Joe."
141,Joey," Now YOU'RE telling me I can't see her?? You guys are killing me! 
  She's forbidden fruit! It's like ... like she's the princess and I'm the stable 
  boy ... Why are you doing this, huh? Did Ross tell you not to let me go over 
  there?"
142,Chandler," Yes, as a matter of fact he did, so I can't let you go."
143,Joey," Huh. Interesting. Now there are obstacles. Hot nanny and me against the 
  world. This is the kind of stuff great novels are made of."
144,Chandler, Great novels? 
145,Joey, Fine ... mediocre porn
148,Rachel," Rachel Green's office!! Give me that phone! (takes the phone) 
  Hello, this is Rachel Green, how can I help you? Uh huh ... ok then ... I'll 
  pass you back to your son (gives phone to Gavin)"
150,Rachel," Um, excuse me Gavin, I have a question I need to ask you."
152,Rachel, If you like looking at butts so much why don't you just go look at a mirror?
154,Rachel," Oh, please, I don't care about you enough to bug me. In fact, 
  from now on, I'm going take the high road. And I'm going be very very nice to 
  you, you ""momma's boy"", starting right now."
156,Monica, Hey Rach!
157,Rachel, Hi!
158,Monica, Ready for your birthday lunch?
159,Rachel," Yeah I am, I am! Oh, but first of all, Monica, I would like to introduce 
  you to my very talented colleage and more importantly my wonderful friend Gavin 
  Mitchelle. "
161,Monica, Pleased to meet you. So you're coming to Rachel's party tonight?
162,Rachel," Oh no no no no no, Gavin can't, he already has plans, most likely with his 
  mother. "
164,Rachel, Why did you invite him?? I can't stand that guy!
165,Monica, You were just being so nice to him!
166,Rachel, I was faking it! Can't you tell when I'm being fake?
168,Rachel," Hey, Mr Philips, nice suit!"
169,Monica, Right there! That was so fake!
170,Rachel, Shh!
172,Rachel," (to Monica) I still can't believe you invited Gavin. Allright, he is the 
  last person I want to see."
173,Monica," Oh, you're welcome for the party. I'm glad you're having a good time."
174,Rachel," God, I hope he doesn't show up. Of course he's not gonna show up, the guy 
  hates me."
175,Monica, Does he?
176,Rachel, What?
177,Monica," Maybe he's bothering you so much because he likes you. It's like in first 
  grade when Skippy Langwild always pushed me on the playground because he secretly 
  had a crush on me?"
178,Rachel," Oh, Monica, you think Skippy liked you? Honey, all those buys had a bet 
  to see if he can knock you over."
180,Rachel," Oh, ok, thank you. (Molly leaves) (to Monica) Do you see what all the guys 
  see in her?"
181,Monica, Wouldn't kick her out of bed. No more Vodka for me! (put her glass down)
183,Joey," Hey Rach, so can I sing happy birthday to you now?"
184,Rachel," Yeah, sure!"
185,Joey," Oh ... (Starts to sing) Happy birth ... (sees Molly leaving) oh, see you 
  later (runs after Molly)"
186,Monica," Hey Rach, somebody got you shoes!"
187,Rachel," Oh, give me! (opens the box happily, then gets freaked and throws away the 
  box, she and Mon jump up the sofa)"
188,Phoebe," Be careful, be careful! These are my rat babies!"
190,Rachel," Ahhhh , you brought rats to my birthday party?"
191,Monica, So this is what a stroke feels like.
192,Phoebe," I had to bring them! We killed their mother, they're our responsibility 
  now. You know, they require constant care. You should know that, Rachel, you're 
  a mother."
193,Rachel, Are you comparing my daughter to a rat?
194,Phoebe," No! Seven rats! I think we should take them home, we need feed 
  them."
195,Rachel," whhh wait, you're gonna leave my party to take care of a box of rats?"
196,Phoebe," Well I'm sorry Rachel, but I'm not like you, ok? Not everyone 
  can afford help. (she and Mike leave)"
198,Ross, Where the hell are Joey and Molly? I asked you to watch them.
199,Chandler," (In a helium voice, holding a balloon) I'm sorry, I got a little occupied."
200,Ross, We have to stop them before something happens!
201,Chandler," (still helium voice) Right behind you, big guy! (they both head for the 
  door) "
203,Joey," So you see, Molly, what people don't understand is that acting is a discipline. 
  It takes a lot of hard work."
205,Joey," Oh, I didn't go to college."
207,Joey, Molly ... people don't study acting ...
209,Ross," Molly, ah, do you mind giving us just a minute?"
211,Ross, Thanx.
213,Joey, (upset) Will the stable boy never get the princess??
214,Ross," What do you think you're gonna do, have sex with her right here on my couch?"
215,Joey," No ... the leather sticks to my ass. You know, this isn't fair. 
  What makes you think that I'm just gonna sleep with her and then blow her off? 
  Huh? Can't you guys open your minds to the possibility that I actally like her, 
  and might want something real? (pause) Look, the truth is, I haven't felt this 
  way about anyone since Rachel, ok? I didn't think I could ever love again."
218,Joey, Ok (admits)
221,Ross," Yeah, come on in. Molly?"
223,Ross," Ok ... (they leave the room, long pause) Well, uh, Joey, I guess we have 
  no problem."
224,Joey," It's like my favorite fairy tale come true! (Chandler looks at him) The 
  princess, the stable boy and the lesbian!"
226,Phoebe," Ok, ok, you start preparing the formula and I start changing 
  the box and then we gotta put them straight to bed."
228,Phoebe," Well, you know what, they're our responsibility now."
230,Phoebe, Mate? They're all brothers and sisters.
232,Phoebe," No. (opens the box) wh - get off your sister! Oh my god, what 
  are we gonna do? We have 7 rats. So what if each of them has 7 rats? And then 
  each of those have 7 rats? That's like ... (starts counting with her fingers) 
  That's math I can't even do! What are we gonna do?"
234,Phoebe," Yeah, ok. I guess you're right. Allright, so we should just give them away. 
  But to nice families, with children, and reduced fat wheat thins. They're Bob's 
  favorites. "
236,Phoebe, You must think I'm crazy.
238,Phoebe," Good. It's just so hard, it's hard for me to ... let them go. 
  I guess it just brings back memories, you know, from ... when I gave birth to 
  my brother's triplets and I had to give them up. (Mike is shocked) I haven't 
  told you about that yet, have I?"
240,Monica, Hey!
241,Rachel," Hi. Thanks for the party, honey. Should I help you clean up?"
242,Monica," No way! You had your party, now I have mine! Is everything alright?"
243,Rachel," Yeah, I just get a little bummed when my birthday's over."
244,Monica," Well, at least you have one thing to be happy about. That jerk Gavin from 
  your office didn't show up (Gavin shows up at the balcony windows)."
245,Rachel, Mmm hmm.
247,Monica," Oh, we weren't talking about you. No, no way to recover."
248,Rachel, No.
251,Rachel," Well, it was, and you would have seen it if you didn't showed up at (looks 
  at his watch) ... 930?? God! Oh, this party was lame ..."
252,Monica," (from inside) Again, you're welcome."
254,Rachel," Oh, you bought me a present! Why?"
256,Rachel," Aww. Well, ok, well that's very nice. And you wrote a card (opens 
  the card). ""From Gavin"""
258,Rachel," (opens the present, it's a green scarf) Awww, awww, it's beautiful."
260,Rachel," See, Gavin, you're capable of being a nice guy. Why did you give me such 
  a hard time?"
262,Rachel, Well Monica seems to think it's because you have feelings for me.
264,Rachel, You do?
266,Rachel," See? Why, Gavin, why? Right when I'm about to change my opinion 
  of you, you go and you ... (he kisses her) and you do that ... (they kiss again)"
269,Chandler," (sings in a helium voice) First I was afraid, I was petrified (very happy)"
270,Phoebe, (walks in) Hey
271,Chandler, (normal voice) Hi
272,Phoebe," Listen, I think I've left something here."
273,Chandler," Oh, well someone left this (shows a green jacket). This is yours?"
274,Phoebe," (likes the jacket) No, but I like it. I think I left one of 
  my rat babies."
275,Chandler," Oh, uh, well, I haven't seem it but if I do I'll let you know."
276,Monica, Ohmygod! Rat baby! Rat baby! Rat baby! (screams from another room)
277,Phoebe," (realizes) Ooh, maybe that's him!"

1,Joey," Morning, roomie!"
2,Rachel, Hey! You remembered to put clothes on this morning.
3,Joey, Fifth day's a charm.
4,Rachel," Oh, Joey, it's so great to be back here. I gotta tell you, you're
      making it so easy on me and Emma."
5,Joey," Hey, it's great having you back. You know, stay as long as you want,
      and when does she stop crying all night?"
7,Ross," Hey, you're not naked! So hey, Rach, when will we expect to see you
      tonight?"
8,Rachel," Well, I'll probably be back to pick her up around six, but she's
      in the bedroom all ready to go. But she did actually fall back to sleep,
      so..."
9,Joey," She's probably exhausted from all that adorable screaming she did
      last night."
10,Rachel, Bye!
12,Ross," Bye! Hey, I hope Emma isn't making it too hard on you."
13,Joey," No, hey, it's been great."
14,Ross, Yeah?
15,Joey," Yeah. And look, I just want you to know that with Rachel staying
      here and everything, all my feelings from before are totally over, okay?
      And even if they weren't, when you accidentally walk in on a woman using
      a breast pump..."
16,Ross," Yeah, that'll do it."
17,Joey," Wow! So, how are you?"
18,Ross," I'm, I'm okay. "
19,Joey, Really?
20,Ross," Sure, I mean, do I wish me and Rachel living together would have
      worked out? Of course. You know, I'm disappointed, but it's not like it's
      a divorce."
21,Joey," Well, actually it..."
22,Ross," No, it's not a divorce, it is not a divorce! Anyway, I think Rachel
      and I need to, you know, get on with our lives, maybe, maybe start seeing
      other people."
23,Joey," Wow, really?"
24,Ross," Yeah, sure, why not? In fact, if you know anyone that would be good
      for me..."
25,Joey," Sure, I know lots of girls. "
26,Ross, Yeah? Any names come to mind?
27,Joey," Ooh, names?"
30,Phoebe, Hey.
31,Joey, Hey. I was just gonna get something to eat. You want something?
32,Phoebe, What you got?
34,Phoebe," Goodie! Thanks. So, how is it living with Rachel again? I mean, apart
      from the great food."
35,Joey," I'm fine, I'm fine, it's just, it's just weird what's happening with
      her and Ross. You know, yesterday he asked me to fix him up with somebody."
36,Phoebe," Oh my god, Rachel asked me if I knew anyone for her too."
37,Joey, Why are they doing this?
38,Phoebe, I don't know. They're so perfect for each other; it's crazy.
39,Joey," You know what's crazy? These jars. What is it, like two bites in
      here?"
40,Phoebe, I just wish they'd realise they should be together.
41,Joey," I know, I know. And when they moved back in together, I figured y'know,
      that's where things were headed."
42,Phoebe," I know. They should be a family. They should get married and have
      more children."
43,Joey," Yes, and they should name one of their kids Joey. I may not have
      kids; someone's gotta carry on the family name."
44,Phoebe," You know what? Maybe once they start dating, and they see what's
      out there, they'll realise how good they are for each other."
45,Joey," Yeah, because it is slim pickings. I had this date last night Yuck!
      But we should probably keep it down; she's still in the bedroom."
46,Phoebe," So, what are we gonna do? Are we just gonna go ahead and set them
      up with people?"
47,Joey, I know; that just pushes them further and further apart. 
48,Phoebe," Yeah. (BEAT) Oh, I know what we can do. We could set Ross and Rachel
      up on horrible dates, so that they'll realise how good they are together."
49,Joey," Ooh, that's a great plan! "
50,Phoebe," Yeah, you know what the best part of it is? I get to do my ""plan-laugh."" (A
      maniacal laugh follows.)"
52,Joey," Shhh! Not so loud, we don't wanna wake up, uh..."
55,Rachel, Hey!
56,Monica, Hey!
57,Rachel," You guys aren't doing anything tonight, are you?"
58,Chandler," See, now, why would you assume that? Just because we're married?
      I will have you know that we are very hip, happening people. Now, if you'll
      excuse me, I have to get back to reading the obituaries."
59,Rachel, I was just asking 'cause I need someone to watch Emma tonight.
60,Monica," Sure, we'll do that. What are you up to?"
61,Rachel," Well, Phoebe set me up on a date. "
62,Monica, Oh my god.
63,Chandler, Wow.
64,Rachel, Why? What's the big deal?
65,Monica," Just figured, 'cause you and Ross are..."
66,Rachel," What, slept together a year and a half ago? Yeah, I'm all set."
67,Chandler," Well, I think it's great that you're going on a date, you know? I
      mean, it sounds healthy. I mean, you have needs. Embrace your womanhood!"
68,Monica," You want a job? Turn off ""Oprah,"" and send out a resume!"
69,Rachel, So I'll bring her by around seven? Is that okay?
70,Monica," Oh, it's perfect."
71,Rachel," Oh, you guys are gonna have so much fun! She's at such a cute age.
      Oh, a couple things. Now that she's eating solid food, she poops around
      the clock. And watch out for your hair, 'cause she likes to grab it. And
      oh, she's also in this phase where if you leave the room, she screams bloody
      murder, but ah... Thanks, you guys. Have fun!"
74,Phoebe," Ooh, Joey. "
75,Joey, Hey.
76,Phoebe, Hey. I'm so excited; I just set up Rachel with the worst guy tonight. 
77,Joey, All right! Who is he?
78,Phoebe," Well, it's this guy I used to massage. And by massage, I mean hold
      down so he wouldn't turn over and flash me."
80,Phoebe," Oh, yeah."
82,Joey, She's this really boring woman. She's a teacher! 
83,Phoebe, A teacher?
84,Joey," Yeah, yeah, she's really into history and foreign movies... And oh,
      oh, she loves puzzles. Huh? Come on, who loves puzzles?"
85,Phoebe," Well, Ross does. What... You're - you're ruining the plan! Joey,
      you've - you've fixed him up with his perfect woman! "
86,Joey," Oh my god, you're right! "
87,Phoebe, Yeah.
88,Joey, She even reads for pleasure!
89,Phoebe, How do you even know a woman like that?
90,Joey, What? I'm not allowed to know smart women? 
91,Phoebe, Joey.
92,Joey, I met her at the library. I went in to pee.
93,Phoebe, So now what do we do?
94,Joey," Well, okay, I'll - I'll just call her and tell her the date's cancelled,
      and find him somebody else."
95,Phoebe," What if we don't find him somebody else? We'll just tell her the
      date's off, but we don't tell Ross, and he goes to the restaurant and gets
      stood up!"
96,Joey, Ooh...I hear that's bad. 
97,Phoebe," Ooh, so this is great! Rachel's gonna have a terrible date, Ross
      gets stood up, and then they'll realise how good they have it together."
98,Joey," Ah, yes, The Plan! (Laughs loudly again, but he sounds more like
      Santa Claus.)"
99,Phoebe," It's not Santa's plan. No, it's... (Laughs the real ""plan-laugh."")"
101,Joey," Yeah, you know, it's not that fun."
102,Phoebe," No, I think we killed it."
104,Chandler," Emma? Emma? Look at me! Well, I think I'll go downstairs for a while."
106,Chandler," No, no, no, no! No, no, no, no! It's okay, it's okay. I didn't go.
      Don't cry, it's just a bit! I'm your uncle Chandler; funny is all I have!"
108,Monica," Okay, just so you know, I'm gonna be ovulating from tomorrow until
      the sixth, so don't touch yourself in the next 48 hours."
109,Chandler, I don't do that.
111,Chandler," I'll try to stop. Wait, did you say until the sixth?"
112,Monica, Yeah.
113,Chandler, Today is the sixth.
114,Monica," No, it's not."
116,Chandler," Yes, it's also 2003."
117,Monica," Oh my god. Today's the sixth?! I may be done ovulating! I may have
      also served some very questionable meat at the restaurant."
118,Chandler, It's okay. Go take the test and see if we're okay.
119,Monica, Okay.
121,Chandler, Tough crib.
122,Monica," Hey, where are all my ovulation-sticks? There's only one here."
123,Chandler, I might have checked to see if I was ovulating a couple times.
124,Monica, Chandler!
125,Chandler, I am not working. There's not much to do around here!
127,Ross," Excuse me, is there a woman waiting at the bar? Someone average height,
      dark hair, perhaps doing a puzzle?"
129,Ross," Well, if I'm still here in an hour, buy him a drink on me."
131,Ross," Nah, I don't know if I should. I don't wanna be drunk when I go home
      alone."
133,Ross," Yeah, it's no big deal. It's just a blind date."
135,Ross, No! 
138,Monica, We're okay. I'm still ovulating.
139,Chandler," Oh, good, because as of four o'clock this afternoon, I am not. "
140,Monica," So, let's do this."
141,Chandler, I - I don't think I can.
142,Monica," Come on. I know you're not eighteen anymore, but give it a minute."
143,Chandler, Because of Emma.
144,Monica," Oh my god, Emma. Oh, sweetie, I forgot you were here. Oh, you're
      right, we can't do this. We can't leave her alone."
145,Chandler, Sorry.
146,Monica," Unless... Maybe we do it here. I mean, how much can she even be aware
      of at this age?"
147,Chandler," Well, she's aware when we leave the room. She may notice if we start...
      canoodling in it."
148,Monica, Canoodling?
149,Chandler," Well, I can't say ""hump"" or ""screw"" in front
      of the B-A-B-Y."
150,Monica," I don't know. I mean, I guess having sex in front of a baby isn't
      so..."
151,Chandler, Horrifying? Scarring? Something people go to jail for?
152,Monica, I guess you're right.
153,Chandler," You guess I'm right? When we stayed at that bed and breakfast, you
      wouldn't have sex with me because you thought a deer was staring through
      the window."
154,Monica, But what kind of a sick bastard wants to do it in front of a deer?
156,Rachel," Wow, everything looks so good! I think I'm gonna have the chicken."
158,Rachel," Oh, well, that's - that's very sweet. Thank you."
160,Rachel, What?
164,Rachel," Well, come on, Steve; let's not rule out nervous laughter. Hey, now
      wait a minute. Phoebe told me that - that you owned your own restaurant.
      That's impressive."
168,Rachel, Really? What's that like?
172,Rachel, Really? 
174,Phoebe, Hello?
176,Rachel," Phoebe, it's me. I'm going to hunt you down and kill you!"
177,Phoebe," Hey, Rach!"
178,Rachel, This is the worst date ever. How could you set me up with this creep?
179,Phoebe," You know, you are talking about one of my dear, dear friends. "
180,Rachel, I don't care! This guy is a nightmare!
181,Phoebe," Oh, right, so he gets a little crazy when he's stoned."
182,Rachel, He's not stoned.
183,Phoebe, Did he go out for a cigarette? 
184,Rachel," Yeah, four times."
185,Phoebe," My dear, sweet Rach."
188,Joey," Oh, great, pretty soon they'll be back together."
189,Phoebe," By the time anyone's figured out what we've done, we'll be in sunny
      Mexico. (BEAT) Oh, wait, that's the end of a different plan."
191,Monica, She's asleep. Chandler?
193,Monica, What are you doing?
194,Chandler, Emma was doing it!
195,Monica, She's asleep.
196,Chandler," Ooh, she's asleep, that means we can..."
197,Monica," Yes, but we have to be fast."
201,Joey, Hello?
203,Joey, Emma? Hey! Hi!
205,Joey," How are ya? How are ya? Where are your babysitters, huh? Why's the
      bedroom door closed?"
207,Joey," You can't have S-E-X, when you're taking care of the B-A-B-I-E!"
211,Ross," Eh, if it was meant to be, it's meant to be."
213,Ross," Wow, free crab cakes. Well, that's nice. Although I was hoping to
      have sex tonight."
216,Ross, Just the crab cakes.
220,Ross, What's - what's going on?
222,Ross, What? You - you're making money off my misery?
224,Ross," This is unbelievable. I - I have never been so insulted in my life.
      Now, if you'll wrap up my free crab cakes, I'll be on my way."
226,Monica," Well, that was weird. You were loud, and I was fast."
227,Chandler, I think we may have really done it this time.
228,Monica," Oh, I wish I didn't have to wait to take a pregnancy test."
229,Chandler, You may wanna get some more of those too.
231,Chandler, Where's Emma?
232,Monica," Oh my god, where's Emma? Where's Emma?"
233,Chandler," Don't ask me, I was in there canoodling you!"
234,Monica," Okay, okay, I'm sure that Rachel came home early and picked up Emma.
      You go look across the hall, and I'll call her cell."
235,Chandler, Okay. (Runs out.)
236,Monica," Hey, you better hope that we're pregnant, because one way or another,
      we're giving a baby back to Rachel."
239,Rachel," No, no, no, I admire a man who can cry."
242,Rachel, Don't touch my coat!
244,Rachel," Oh, sorry, it's my phone. Hello?"
246,Rachel," Oh my god, this is the worst date ever!"
249,Monica," Hey, did you stop by here?"
250,Rachel, No.
251,Monica," Oh my god, then..."
253,Monica," Oh, thank god! Emma, there you are!"
254,Rachel," What? What do you mean, ""there you are""? Where was she?"
255,Monica," Oh, we were playing ""peek-a-boo."" She just – she loves
      it when I'm dramatic."
258,Joey, Because you two were having sex!
259,Monica," No, we weren't!"
260,Joey," Don't you lie to me! I could tell by Chandler's hair. (To Chandler.)
      You are so lazy. Can't you get on top for once?"
261,Chandler," All right, all right, we were. We were trying to make a baby. Monica's
      ovulating."
262,Joey," Hey! It is unacceptable that you two would have sex with Emma in
      the next room. I'm gonna have to tell Rachel about this. "
264,Chandler," No, no, no."
265,Monica," No, please don't. Please, Joey. She will kill us!"
266,Joey," Hey, I gotta! Unless..."
267,Monica, Unless what?
268,Joey, Unless you name your firstborn child Joey.
269,Chandler, What? Why?
270,Joey," Hey, I may never have kids, and somebody's gotta carry on my family
      name."
271,Chandler, Your family name is Tribbiani.
272,Joey, (BEAT) (Laughs.) You almost had me.
275,Rachel," Well, uh..."
277,Rachel," Really, really not."
279,Rachel," All right, well that's good to know. Good night, Steve."
281,Ross," Hey, what's wrong?"
282,Rachel, I just had a rough night.
283,Ross, Oh. Crab cake?
284,Rachel, Eww!
285,Ross," Well, what happened?"
286,Rachel," Oh, well, I...It's kind of weird talking to you about this, but..."
287,Ross, Monica told me you had a blind date.
288,Rachel, Yeah.
289,Ross," I did, too."
290,Rachel, Oh.
291,Ross, But is it technically a date if the other person doesn't show up?
292,Rachel," Oh, oh no. Do you think she walked in, saw you and left?"
293,Ross, Why does everyone keep saying that?
294,Rachel," Well, if it makes you feel any better, I wish my date hadn't shown
      up."
295,Ross, That bad?
296,Rachel," Well, he makes t-shirts for a living, and he thought it would be
      appropriate to give me this."
298,Ross, Female body inspector? What size is that?
300,Phoebe," Now, wait a minute. So, they're gonna name their first child Joey?"
301,Joey, Uh-huh.
302,Phoebe, How - how do I get them to name the next one after me?
303,Joey," It's easy, you just walk in on them having sex."
304,Phoebe," Oh, so they owe me like, three Phoebes."
306,Phoebe," Oh my god! Look, it's Ross and Rachel. Oh, the plan is working."
308,Phoebe," Don't, don't do the plan-laugh."
310,Ross," The first date we've had in months, and they were both such disasters."
311,Rachel," Oh. Huh. You know, it is weird that Phoebe would
      set me up on a date that was awful on the same night that Joey set you
      up on a date that didn't even show."
312,Ross," Wait a minute; you don't think it was intentional? I mean, that's
      just stupid."
314,Joey," We're geniuses! Yeah, look at them, look at them, they're really
      bonding."
315,Phoebe," Oh, yeah, they're falling in love all over again."
317,Phoebe," Oh, they see us! Oh, they, they look mad. Oh, they figured it out.
      They're coming this way. Run!"
318,Joey, Where?
319,Phoebe, Mexico!
323,Joey, Can you believe they're still not here?
324,Ross," I know. A double blind date, and we both get stood up. What are the
      chances?"
325,Joey," I know, I'm so bummed. Can we have our free crab cakes now?"
327,Joey, We've been stood up. (sniffles) And we want our free crab cakes.
0,Chandler, Did you see our bank statement? Can this be right?
1,Monica," I know...God. I haven't seen my savings take a hit like this since
  I was a kid and they came up with double-stuffed Oreos. What happened to all
  our money?"
2,Chandler," I'm not sure what they did, but I'm inclined to blame Enron."
3,Monica," I guess with you doing the internship, we're just spending more than
  we're bringing in."
4,Chandler, Maybe I should quit and get a job that pays.
5,Monica," Oh, But you're finally doing something that you love! I can't ask
  you to give that up. Though it'd be nice if the thing that you love was y'know...
  finding gold."
6,Chandler," You know what? You know what? I think we're making too big a deal
  out of this. ok? So we pay our bills a little late this month and maybe next
  month we cut back on a few things. And maybe we start eating out of Joey's
  refrigerator for a change. You're chef... what can you make out of backing
  soda and beer?"
7,Monica, Ok worse case scenario is...we borrow some money from my parents.
8,Chandler, No! We're not borrowing money.
9,Monica, Why not?
10,Chandler," Because we don't do that. We are Bings! And if there's one thing
  my father taught me was... well to always knock before going into the pool
  house... but the other thing was never borrow money."
11,Monica, Wow! I Had no idea you had this much pride.
12,Chandler," That's right! I do! And I'm your man. And I'm going to get us through
  this situation even if it means you working twice as hard."
16,Phoebe, Why??
18,Phoebe," Oh...you don't have to go, I have something that will fit you."
20,Phoebe, I want you to stay.
22,Phoebe, Why don't you turn them inside ou...
24,Phoebe, I'll miss you.
26,Phoebe, Great! Ok...I'll go get the tube top.
28,Phoebe," Wow, Mike Hannigan...You sure know how to make a girl say ""Hell
  yeah!"""
30,Phoebe," Yeah! Let's do it! Let's live together! (They embrace and Mike kisses
  Phoebe) Oh god, we're really going to move in together!"
32,Phoebe," I've always wanted to live with a guy. ""Pick up your socks!"" ""Put
  down the toilet seat!"" ""No! We're not having sex anymore!"" It's
  gonna be fun!"
34,Monica, Hey Joey!
35,Joey, Hey!
36,Monica," Listen...I need to know that what I'm about to ask you, will never
  get back to Chandler."
38,Joey," I'd be lying if I said I haven't thought about it myself. Chandler is
  my best friend, it would be wrong. Good...(He winks)...But wrong."
39,Monica," (Looks exasperated) Ok first of all...It would be great. But that's
  not what I'm here to talk to you about. I need to borrow some money."
40,Joey," Aww, I don't know Monica y'know... erm... lending friends money is always
  a mistake."
41,Monica, But Chandler lent you money!
42,Joey, And I think he would tell you it was a mistake.
43,Monica, Come on...I just need it for some rent and..and some other bills.
44,Joey, Oh...how much?
45,Monica, Two thousand dollars?
46,Joey, Two thousand dollars!? What do you think I am? I soap opera star!?
47,Monica, Yeah...
48,Joey, That's right I am! (Opens drawer and rummages through it. Rachel enters)
49,Rachel, Hi you guys!
51,Joey, Oo...what's in the bag?
52,Rachel," Oh er... well you know Emma started crawling? I realised that this
  place, is very unsafe for a baby. So I went to the store and got some stuff
  to baby-proof the apartment."
53,Joey," Oh...baby-proofing... Why is this such a big deal now? Y'know, when
  I was a kid it was like.. ""Whoops! Joey fell down the stairs!"" or
  er.. ""Whoops! Joey electrocuted himself again!"" Huh!"
54,Monica," Anyway erm, are you going to get a handyman to install this stuff?"
55,Rachel, No. I was just going to do this myself. (Joey makes a sarcastic laugh.)
56,Joey, You're gonna do it?
57,Rachel," Yeah, Why? You don't think a woman can do this?"
58,Joey," Oh, women can. You can't."
59,Rachel, Monica...would you please tell Joey that he is a pig?
60,Monica, You're a pig. And you can't do this.
61,Rachel, Wha!? What!? Come on! I found the hardware store all by myself!
62,Joey, The hardware store is right down the street.
63,Rachel, There is a hardware store right down the street?
65,Phoebe," Hey you guys! Ok, we've got great news."
68,Phoebe, I know it's so exciting! You know I've never lived with a guy before.
69,Monica," Well you know it's just like living with a girl. Only they don't steal
  your makeup. Unless they're playing ""This is what my sister would look
  like"" (Looks at Chandler)"
70,Chandler, Yeah.... she's not so cute.
72,Phoebe," Okay, well you put down the toilet seat."
74,Monica, Is that a bit you guys do?
75,Phoebe, Uh huh...we're playing you two.
76,Monica, We don't do that! Tell her we don't do that!
77,Chandler, Yes dear.
78,Ross," I can't believe you guys are moving in together. That's, that's great!
  I mean...I'm happy for you guys.."
79,Monica, I hear wedding bells.
80,Phoebe," Monica slow down! Ok? I'm just excited to be living with him. You
  know I mean, I don't know, Can I see someday being married to Mike? Sure! Yeah.
  Y'know..I can picture myself walking down the aisle in a wedding dress that
  highlights my breasts in an obvious yet classy way. But do I want that house
  in Connecticut...you know..near the good schools where Mike and I can send
  Sophie and Mike Junior.. Oh my god I do."
81,Ross," Phoebe, I had no idea you were so conventional."
82,Phoebe," I know! I guess I am! Oh my god! Load up the Volvo I want to be a
  soccer mom!"
84,Phoebe, Yeah! You bet roomy!
85,Monica, Don't you mean..groomy?
87,Phoebe," Oh please, these guys, we haven't even moved in yet and they have
  us picking out china patterns. (Mike seems to gag a little...and laughs nervously.
  They begin to leave. Phoebe bolts back)"
88,Phoebe, China patterns!!!!!
90,Rachel," This is easy...Can't do this! (Moves away...and finds her sweater
  sleeve stuck to the drawer) Oh! Wow! Seriously I can't do this. (Fiddles more)"
92,Chandler, Hey Joe!
93,Joey, Hey!
94,Chandler," Listen er..I need to ask you a favor but you can't tell Monica anything
  about it."
95,Joey, I thought you didn't have secrets from Monica.
96,Chandler," And that would have made the official party line. (Joey nods) Monica
  and I are having a little financial trouble."
97,Joey," Yeah, I know."
98,Chandler, What? What do you mean you know?
99,Joey," Err... I just figured it out! You know, I mean you're not working and
  the economy is bad."
100,Chandler, Oh! Right.
101,Joey, (to himself) That's the fastest I have ever thought!
102,Chandler," Anyway, err... I need to borrow some money."
103,Joey, Oh! Sure! How much? Two thousand dollars?
104,Chandler," Yes! Two thousand dollars exactly! How do you know that! (Joey begins
  writing a cheque)"
105,Joey," Err...Well I...Know how much you used to make and I know how much your
  rent is. (shrugs)"
106,Chandler, Oh ok.
107,Joey, (To himself) I am on fire!
109,Joey, Err... Kind of.
110,Chandler, I can't believe her! Did she tell you we were having money problems?
111,Joey," Oh no no no no no... It wasn't... It wasn't because of your money problems,
  it was for something for her."
112,Chandler, What?
113,Joey, Something personal.
114,Chandler," What would she get for herself for two thousand dollars that she
  wouldn't tell me about?"
117,Joey, Boob job.
118,Monica, I don't want her to get a boob job! That's crazy!
119,Joey," Well it's...It's not that crazy okay? Making them smaller, that would
  be crazy."
122,Phoebe," Oh! Alright. Well I think the reason people laugh is becuase it's
  a play on the word roomy."
124,Phoebe," Oh no! No no! Not at all. We're just moving in right now. See where
  it goes."
126,Phoebe, What do you mean?
128,Phoebe, Oh. Wow.
130,Phoebe, Was it really that bad?
132,Phoebe," Ok, well that's bad. But don't you think it might be different with
  someone else? Perhaps a blonde who always uses a toilet. Except for once in
  the ocean."
134,Phoebe, But it's just...
136,Phoebe, Oh!
138,Phoebe," No! I definitely don't wanna get married. No I just wanted to make
  sure you didn't want to too. Whew! Coz you know when we move in and you start
  changing your mind there's gonna be hell to pay mister!"
140,Phoebe, Yeah I get that.
142,Rachel, Hi!
143,Monica, So you gave in and decided to call someone?
144,Rachel," Yeah, I don't know who I was kidding. I can barely use chopsticks."
146,Rachel," Oh thank you so much. (Picks up the guy's spirit level) Oh oh wait!
  You forgot your erm...Your game. (hands it to him)"
149,Chandler, Hey Rach! There she is...My perfectly proportioned wife.
150,Rachel, Don't look at me I never get his jokes.
151,Monica, Thank you?
152,Chandler," Oh no..don't thank me. Thank you. You know there's not one thing
  I would change about you? Not one single thing! And definitely not... two...
  single things."
153,Monica," Ok, you're being wierd. Do you want sex or did you do something bad?"
154,Chandler," No no! I just love the way you look, I am warm, for your form."
155,Monica," Ok..You know the old classics you know,You look nice? They're still
  ok."
156,Chandler," Well yes yes... You look nice can mean that your face looks nice.
  I want to compliment your body. I mean..I wouldn't change it. At all. And more
  specifically, I wouldn't want anything to get any bigger."
157,Monica, Okay...
158,Chandler," I mean, You wouldn't want any part of me to get any bigger would
  you? Don't answer that."
160,Rachel, Just when you thought that dude couldn't get any wierder.
161,Monica, I know why do you think he was so worried about me getting bigger?
162,Rachel," I don't know! I mean, what brought that on?"
163,Monica," Oh my god. We're trying to get pregnant so he's probably starting
  to freak out about the fact that my body is going to change."
164,Rachel, No you really think that's what it is?
165,Monica," You heard him! ""No bigger!"" ""You're perfect!"" ""Just
  don't get any bigger!"" Oh my god he sounded just like my high school wrestling
  coach. You know what? I'm going to have to talk to Chandler."
166,Rachel," Yeah! If you don't I will! Of course your body's gonna change. Your
  breasts are gonna get bigger, your ass is gonna get bigger, you're gonna lose
  bladder control. (she starts sobbing) God! It's just such a magical time!"
168,Phoebe, Hi
169,Ross, Hey!
170,Phoebe," Listen, I wanted to ask you something about marriage."
171,Ross," Oh great now you're seeking me out to make jokes? I mean I can see for
  all hanging out but to come to my home!"
172,Phoebe, No...I really wanted to know how you feel about it.
173,Ross, Why?
174,Phoebe, Mike doesn't ever wanna get married.
175,Ross, Never?
176,Phoebe, Never.
177,Ross," wow, are you still going to move in with him?"
178,Phoebe," I want to, but I just want you to tell me that marriage isn't really
  that big a deal. You know that I won't, I won't be missing out on anything.
  That marriage stinks!"
179,Ross," Yeah, marriage... stinks! I mean if you wanna see a man gain weight
  and a woman stop shaving? Get them married."
180,Phoebe, That's not how you really feel is it?
181,Ross," No, I'm sorry. Look I don't think that's what you wanna hear right now
  but I can't help it. I love marriage."
182,Phoebe, Seriously? You divorce-o?
183,Ross," If you have to call me name, I prefer ""Ross the Divorcer"".
  It's just cooler. Look, I know my marriage isn't exactly work out. But I love
  to be that committed to another person. And Carol had some good times before
  she became a lesbian... and once afterward. I'm sorry."
184,Phoebe, It's ok that's how you feel.
185,Ross," But come on! I mean living together will be great! I mean you guys have
  so much fun and you love Mike."
186,Phoebe, I do love Mike.
187,Ross," Yeah see? And you are so excited about moving in together before, and
  you know what? You should be. It's a big deal!"
188,Phoebe, Yeah I guess you're right. Yeah thanks. This helped. Thanks.
189,Ross," The Divorcer, to the rescue!"
190,Phoebe, It's not cooler.
191,Ross, Yeah I just hurt it.
193,Joey," Rach?! (He walks over to the fridge to put it in, but it cannot be opened
  either) Rachel!!!!? (He walks to the bathroom and tries to lift the toilet
  seat cover. It won't come up.) So I can't do anything I like????"
195,Chandler," Hey Rach! Ah........ Perfection. (kisses monica) Wouldn't change
  a thing. Not a thing."
196,Monica, Honey?
197,Chandler, Yeah?
198,Monica, About that? Erm...I'm going to change.
199,Chandler, But honey you don't have to.
200,Monica, I'm going to get bigger!
201,Chandler, Honey I... I love your breasts the way they are!
202,Rachel, Argh. fascist
203,Monica," Well, my breasts are going to get bigger weather you like it or not!
  And you know what? It's not just my breasts. My ass is going to get bigger
  too."
204,Chandler, your ass?!?!?
205,Rachel," Man, don't be surprised if her hands and her feet get bigger too!"
206,Chandler, They...do that?
207,Monica, It's kind of a package deal!
208,Chandler, God why why would you want to do that to yourself!?
209,Monica, I thought I was something that we both wanted!
210,Chandler," Alright look, if it means that much to you, a may be able to get
  on more with the big boobs. But the giant ass and the big clown feet?"
211,Rachel," Oh my god Chandler! If you can't handle this, what are you going to
  be like in the hospital? With the blood and the screaming and the little present
  that's shooting out of her!?"
212,Chandler, (sedated) What?
214,Rachel, Joey! Why did you tell Chandler that Monica was getting a boob job?
215,Joey, Because she is!
216,Monica," Joey, Chandler knows I borrowed the money."
217,Joey, Mmmm hmm! For your boob job!
219,Joey," OK so I'm out four thousand dollars and nobody's boobs are getting any
  bigger?"
221,Ross," Hey! What do you guys think about this. ""Ross The Divorce-Force""."
222,Phoebe, Better.
224,Ross," Hey Pheebs, you know I'm i'm really glad you came to talk to me the
  other day and I hope I was a little helpful."
225,Phoebe," Oh yeah you were helpful! Yeah, no, thanks you."
226,Ross," Good, good. Yeah coz the more I thought about it, the more I realised
  I don't think marriage is neccessarily the right path for you."
227,Phoebe, What do you mean?
228,Ross," Well, I know the other day in the coffeehouse you were caught up in
  the whole soccer mom thing? but is that really you? I mean can you honestly
  picture yourself in a Volvo?"
229,Phoebe, They are awfully boxy...
230,Ross, I don't know you'd be so bored with marriage. I mean it's so... normal.
231,Phoebe, Uh huh.
233,Ross," Hey hey, can I help?"
234,Chandler," Well! We er..climbed up four flights of stairs, manueveored a narrow
  hallway, dodged a rabid pitbul... but these last three feet are where it gets
  really tricky."
235,Ross, You know sometimes your words... they hurt.
236,Joey," Hey uh, where do you guys want this?"
237,Rachel," Yeah, seriously coz this is really heavy. (She suddenly lets go) I
  mean not for me because i'm only pretending to hold this, but for these guys."
238,Phoebe," Just one last time erm... the marriage thing... there's no wiggle
  room? None at all?"
240,Phoebe, Right. Except that I do want to get married.
241,Joey, (voice strained) Couldn't have this conversation down at the truck huh?
243,Phoebe, Someday.
244,Chandler, Aaaaand....... hernia.
245,Phoebe," I haven't exactly had a normal life and I never really felt I was
  missing out on anything but it just feels that now it's my turn some of the
  regular stuff."
247,Phoebe," Because I just didn't know how much I wanted it. And I love you, and
  I wanted to live with you."
249,Phoebe," But I don't think I can! it was ok to move in when I didn't know what
  was gonna happen, but I can't move in knowing that nothing is ever gonna happen."
251,Phoebe, Are you gonna change yours?
253,Phoebe, Me neither. I think I need to be with someone who wants what I want.
255,Phoebe, I don't want it to end either.
257,Phoebe, Yeah.
260,Rachel, I'm so sorry Pheebs.
261,Monica, We're all sorry... (They have a group hug)
262,Chandler," Ah, look on the bright side, I mean you won't have to live with
  this ugly chair! That was here already huh? I love you. (they hug again)"
265,Joey," AH HAH! I DID IT! HA HA! Alright... (He takes a box out, about to close
  fridge, then thinks.) Better take all I can carry. Who knows when i'll be able
  to get in here again!"
0,Chandler, Hey! Ready to go?
1,Ross," Oh yeah, let me just finish this."
2,Joey," Hey Ross, check this out! (he tries to spin a basketball on his fingertip but he throws it against a table) yeah, I can't do that!"
3,Chandler, What are you doin'?
4,Ross," Have you seen this? It's a new alumni website for college! It's cool! You can post messages for people, let everyone know what you're up to."
5,Chandler," Great, a faster way to tell people that I'm unemployed and childless ."
6,Ross, It's actually kinda interesting to find out what people are doing... remember Andrea Rich?
7,Chandler, The tall girl who wouldn't sleep with you?
8,Ross," Uh uh... well, her Internet Company went under and she lost an ear in a boating accident... "
9,Chandler, Bet she'd sleep with you now... 
10,Ross, No... I already e-mailed her.
11,Chandler," Let me see what you wrote about yourself ""Doctor Paleontology, two kids... "" (pause) You split with Carol because you have different interests?... I think you split with Carol because you've one very similar interest!"
12,Ross," You know what? I'm gonna finish this later, ok? Let me just grab my coat."
13,Joey, Hey! (he throws the basketball against a table again)
14,Ross, (he picks up the ball) What do you think you learnt how to do in the last two minutes?? (he enters another room)
15,Chandler," Maybe we finish this for him! (he sits down on the sofa and he start typing on Ross' computer) ""Also I cloned a dinosaur in my lab. She's now my girlfriend. I don't care what society says. It's the best sex I've ever had""... aaand SEND!"
16,Joey," (he stops Chandler from posting the message) No, no, no... what do... you can't do that to him!"
17,Ross," (he comes back) Alright, let's go!"
18,Joey, Dude! (he opens his arms to receive the ball from Ross' hands)
19,Ross, I think you made it clear you cannot be trusted with the ball inside the house!
20,Joey, (after Ross leaves the room) aaand SEND! (he hits the send button)
23,Rachel, Hey! How was basketball?
24,Joey," Oh, it was a lot of fun right up until Chandler got a finger in the eye!"
25,Rachel," Oh, no! Who did that?"
26,Joey, Chandler... hey... (he goes towards his room but he stops near Emma's cot) Rach... what's Hugsy doin' in the crib with Emma? (he looks puzzled)
27,Rachel," She was just crawling around and she found him, so I just let her sleep with him. That's all right? Isn't it?"
28,Joey," (still very puzzled) Oh, yeah... of course... yeah... it's a stuffed animal... you know... it's for kids... not for adults... I know that!"
29,Rachel," Joey... are you sure? I mean, I know how much you love him!"
30,Joey," Rachel... let's be clear on this, ok? I do not love Hugsy. I like him a normal amount... "
31,Rachel," All right... Oh, Emma loves him!"
32,Joey, Why wouldn't she? He's a wonderful person!
34,Phoebe, Hi.
35,Monica, Hey Phoebe... how you doin'? You feelin' better?
36,Phoebe," Breaking up sucks! Oh, I really miss Mike!"
37,Chandler," Oh, I'm so sorry!"
38,Phoebe," Oh God, I tried everything to make myself feel better. I even tried writing a song about it... but... I can't think of anything that rhymes with AARRGGHH!! (pause) Hey Monica, I really need your help getting through this... "
39,Chandler, You're not gonna need my help?
40,Phoebe," Well no, when I get to the point where... you know... I'm ready to hear cruel mocking jokes about Mike... I'm gonna come to you."
41,Chandler," Oh good, 'cause I've already thought of 3... 4! I've just thought of a fourth (he goes towards the counter)"
42,Phoebe," Ok. I mean I know I did the right thing. You know, Mike never wants to get married and I shouldn't be in a relationship that has no future... but... pretty soon I'm gonna miss him so much. I'm gonna wanna see him again and you have to stop me from doing that."
43,Monica," Ok, you got it!"
44,Phoebe," (after a pause) Unless... Maybe it's too crazy about this... Alright so... you know, there is no future... but that doesn't mean we still can't have fun. You know what? Forget what I said."
45,Monica, Really? If that's what you want... 
46,Phoebe, That was a test and you just failed.
47,Monica, Damn it! Rookie mistake!
49,Ross, (yelling at Chandler) I have sex with dinosaurs??
50,Chandler, I believe I read that somewhere!
51,Ross," That only is not funny, it's physically impossible! Ok? Depending on the species I'd have to have a six foot long...  (pause) It's not funny!!"
52,Chandler, I respectfully disagree.
53,Ross, I can't believe you put that on my alumni page!
54,Chandler, Who cares? Nobody reads those things
55,Ross, You'd better hope not because I just read what you put on your page today.
56,Chandler, I don't have a page.
57,Ross, Oh oh oh! I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE!!
59,Joey," Look at you, all sweet and innocent, sleeping like an angel...  with Emma's chubby little hands wrapped around ya. (he picks up Hugsy) It's okay, Emma, you stay asleep. (Emma cries)"
60,Rachel," (threatening Joey with a scrunchy) Step away from the crib, I have a weapon!"
61,Joey," It's okay, it's okay Rach, it's me. Put down the scrunchy."
62,Rachel, What are you doing?
63,Joey," Well, I heard Emma stirring, so I came to make sure she could reach Hugsy."
64,Rachel," Oh, oh thanks. Alright well, now that I'm up I'm going to go to the bathroom."
65,Joey, (placing Hugsy back in the crib) There you go sweetie...  (to Emma) This isn't over.
67,Monica," Alright, wait a second, why would Ross tell everyone in your class that you are as...  (reads from the screen) ""gay as the day is long""?"
68,Chandler, Because I told everyone he slept with dinosaurs.
69,Monica, But that's clearly a joke. This could easily be true. (Phone rings)
70,Chandler, Would you get that please? People have been calling to congratulate me all day.
71,Monica," (On the phone) Hello? No, he's not here. Yeah, this is his wife. Yeah, well, it came as quite a shock to me too. I guess I should have known. Yeah, I mean, he just kept making me watch Moulin Rouge."
72,Chandler," Hang up, hang up. And that was a great movie! (Monica hangs up) I'm so gonna get back at Ross... oh yeah, this will show him, here we go (starts typing something)."
73,Monica, What are you doing?
74,Chandler," Oh, you'll see my friend."
76,Ross, (visibly upset) I'm dead?
77,Chandler, (faking sympathy) And so young.
78,Ross, Posting that I died? That really isn't funny.
79,Chandler," Well, how you died was funny."
80,Ross," Oh please, hit by a blimp?"
81,Chandler, It kills over one americans every year.
82,Ross," Unbelievable, my classmates are gonna think I'm dead, my professors, my... my parents are gonna get phone calls. You're messing with people's feelings here."
83,Chandler, You wanna talk about people's feelings? You should have heard how hurt professor Stern was yesterday when I told him I wouldn't be able to go with him to Key West!
84,Ross," You've really crossed the line here, but that's okay, it's ok 'cause I'm on my way to buy some Photoshop software and a stack of gay porn. That's right! Your coming out is about to get real graphic."
86,Phoebe," God, I wish Mike were here."
87,Monica, Okay if Mike were here what would the two of you be doing?
89,Monica," What are you, animals? It's 4 o'clock in the afternoon!"
90,Phoebe," I gotta call him. Just to talk to him, there's no harm in that."
91,Monica," Phoebe, that's how it starts. I don't need to eat the cake, I'll just smell the icing... why don't I just eat a little sliver, or, okay, just a slice or two. And next thing you know, you're 210 pounds and you get wedged in going down the tunnel slide. Phoebe, honey, I know this is hard. Look, if you talk to him, you're going to wanna see him. And if you see him, you're going to want to get back together with him. I know that's not what you want. (pause) Give me your phone."
92,Phoebe, Here.
93,Monica, And now your cell.
94,Phoebe," Okay (she takes a huge, clearly obsolete cellphone she keeps in a closet and gives it to Monica)"
95,Monica, This is your cellphone?
96,Phoebe, Yes.
97,Monica, This is your current cellphone?
98,Phoebe," Yes, it reminds me of a simpler time."
99,Monica," Phoebe, where's your purse?"
101,Monica," No, no! Give it to me!"
102,Phoebe, You can't have it.
103,Monica, Give it to me!
104,Phoebe, No (tucks it in her pants)
105,Monica, I'll go in there.
106,Phoebe, (disbelievingly) Oh yeah.
107,Monica, Phoebe come here
109,Monica, Haha!
110,Phoebe, Damn you Monica Geller hyphen Bing!
112,Joey," Hey, look who's here! It's Joey, and he brought home a friend."
113,Rachel," Joey, Emma's right here! You promised not to bring girls home in the middle of the day anymore."
114,Joey," No, no, it's not a girl, it's...  a brand new Hugsy!"
115,Rachel," Oh that's so great, now Emma has two Hugsy's."
116,Joey," No, no, Emma has one Hugsy, the new Hugsy, huh? The other Hugsy, I don't know, I guess I'll just take it back."
117,Rachel," Oh you know what? When I was a little girl I had a little pink pony named Cotton. Oh I loved her so much, I took her everywhere, I would braid her tail... "
118,Joey, Make the transfer! (She does so)
119,Rachel, Should I be concerned that a button fell off the old Hugsy and I can't find it?
120,Joey," Oh, no don't worry about that, I swallowed that years ago."
122,Rachel," Oh, I don't think she likes the new Hugsy."
123,Joey, But he's the same.
124,Rachel," Yeah, I think she wants the old one back."
125,Joey, But he's the same.
126,Rachel," Joey, come on!"
127,Joey, He's the same!
129,Joey, (to the new Hugsy) You're not the same!
131,Monica, Haha!
132,Phoebe," You know, it's a lot less surprising to do that after I've buzzed you into the building."
133,Monica," So Phoebe, why are there men's shoes by the door."
134,Phoebe, Those are my shoes.
135,Monica," Oh, when you get over this breakup we need to go shopping."
136,Phoebe," Monica, I really appreciate you checking in on me, but I'm actually feeling a lot better. Yeah, I just kinda want to be alone right now."
138,Monica, Who's that? (goes to open door)
139,Phoebe, I ordered Chinese food.
141,Phoebe, What are the chances? 1 billion Chinese people and they send Mike!?
142,Monica, (To Mike) What are you doing here?
144,Monica, Phoebe!
145,Phoebe," I'm sorry, I broke down...  I wanted to see him."
146,Monica, Damnit Phoebe! How did you even call him?
147,Phoebe, There is a speakerphone on the base unit... 
148,Monica, Base Unit! Think Monica! Think!
150,Monica, (to Mike) This doesn't concern you!!
152,Monica," Look, guys, you can't do this, it's just going to make getting over each other, that much harder."
153,Phoebe, Not if nothing happens. Why can't... why can't we just hang out as friends?
154,Monica," Sure! If you're just gonna hang out as friends, then maybe I'll join ya. You know, I'm your friend (to Phoebe) and Mike's friend (Mike is sceptical)."
155,Phoebe, Sit down.
157,Monica, Oh wow wow wow!! Make room for your friend! (sits herself down between them)
159,Monica, I've been pretty good!
161,Phoebe," Thanks, you look good too."
162,Monica, Oh no no no no... this is dangerous territory. Keep it clean!
163,Phoebe, So how's the piano playing going?
165,Phoebe, I've missed you too.
167,Monica," You know, on the way over here, I saw this drunk guy throw up. And then a pigeon ate it!"
169,Chandler," Hey, Ross, I just wanted to apologize... (­looks at laptop screen)..don't tell me you actually made those gay pictures of me?"
170,Ross," uhu uhu, check this out. (Chandler sits down and looks at laptop screen)"
171,Chandler, Huh! So that's what I would look like if I worked out... and was being serviced by a policeman. You're not actually going to send these out are ya?
172,Ross," Eh..actually no, I don't need to because your little ""Ross is dead"" joke didn't work, ok, there were no responses. Nobody posted anything on the website, nobody called my parents, so the joke my friend is on you. Nobody called, nobody wrote anything, nobody cares that I'm dead. (silence) Oh my God! Nobody cares that I'm dead!?"
173,Chandler," No, come on, you know that's not true."
174,Ross, What are you talking about? You get sixty responses just for coming out of the closet! I didn't get one response! And I'm dead!
175,Chandler," Well, the gay community is a lot more vocal than the dead community."
176,Ross, I can't believe this. Not even my geology lab partner? And I carried that guy! (gets up from his sofa)
177,Chandler," Alright look, let's think about this, ok, do you really think that people are gonna stir up your family at this tragic time? That people are gonna post condolences on a website? This is not about people not caring that you're dead .This is about people not having a decent outlet for their grief."
178,Ross, You're right. There isn't a decent outlet.
179,Chandler," Right, I mean, come on, I'm sure that if you had a funeral or a memorial service, tons of people would come."
180,Ross, Exactly!! (sits back down at his laptop and starts typing)
181,Chandler," Ross, what're you... what're you... what are you doing? (looks at laptop screen)You're having a memorial service for yourself!?"
182,Ross, No! That would be stupid! You're having it for me!
183,Chandler," Ross, don't press send, don't press se... !"
184,Ross," oh, too late, too late! It's sent... oops sorry and so is the picture of you and the police man... "
186,Rachel," I'm trying to put Emma down for a nap, have you seen Hugsy?"
187,Joey, Original or crappy?
188,Rachel, Original.
189,Joey," No, sorry haven't seen him."
190,Rachel, Then what's that big lump under your covers?
191,Joey," It's Monica, ok?"
192,Rachel, That's not Monica!
193,Joey," Alright!! Fine! It's original Hugsy! No, now I know that Emma wants him but he's mine and I need him.."
194,Rachel, (to herself) Oh God.
195,Joey, ... she's being unreasonable!
196,Rachel," (yelling) Joey, there is a reason that Emma loves that stupid penguin so much (Joey covers Hugsy's ears) Oh don't cover its ears! (stops yelling) It's because it reminds her of her uncle Joey!"
197,Joey, It does?
198,Rachel, Yeah! And she's comforted by him because she loves her uncle Joey so much.
199,Joey, Really? She... she loves me?
200,Rachel," Oh yeah! But you know what? If you need Hugsy, don't worry. Emma will totally understand. I won't... but whatever (She leaves the room)."
201,Joey," Ok, wait wait wait wait a minute wait a minute, I mean Rach, I mean if if... . If Hugsy means that much to Emma then...  well she can have him."
202,Rachel," Oooh... you're sweet, I knew uncle Joey would step up. (Turns to face Emma in the the playpen) Look Emma, look who's baaack!"
203,Joey, Look forget it forget it...  I can't do it.
204,Rachel, Are you gonna...  you're going to take Hugsy away from a little child?
205,Joey, How do you think I got him in the first place?
208,Monica," Alright you two, I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Now I don't want anything going on while I'm gone. Here's a few things you can discuss mucus, fungus and the idea of me and Ross doing it."
210,Phoebe," I know, I want that too, but IS that going to make it too hard?"
212,Monica," (running back into the room) Kiss him, you fool!!"
213,Phoebe, What?
214,Monica, Didn't you hear that speech? If you don't kiss him then I will!
215,Phoebe," Oh, I missed you so much! (she kisses Mike)"
218,Phoebe, Who is this?
220,Monica," Hi, that's what I'm doing for Phoebe!"
222,Monica, Excuse me?
224,Monica," Hey, at least I knew where my guy was."
226,Monica, You didn't hear the speech!
228,Monica," Hey, it was very moving! You're just heartless!"
230,Monica, You're... weird!
232,Monica, Oh (realizes her pants are undone and zips them up)!
234,Monica, Damn it!
236,Monica, And I blame you too.
238,Ross," It's been an hour and not one of my classmates has shown up! I tell you, when I actually die some people are gonna get seriously haunted!"
240,Chandler, There you go! Someone came!
241,Ross," Ok, ok! I'm gonna go hide! Oh, this is so exciting, my first mourner! (he hides in the bedroom and closes the door)"
243,Monica," Hi, glad you could come."
244,Chandler," (in a mournful voice) Please, come in."
246,Chandler," Oh yes, yes... let me... take your coat."
248,Chandler, At least he died doing what he loved... watching blimps (he goes in the bedroom)
249,Ross, Who is he?
250,Chandler," Some guy, Tom Gordon."
251,Ross," I don't remember him, but then again I touched so many lives. (they press their ears against the door)"
252,Monica," So, did you know Ross well?"
254,Monica," (a bit surprised) Yes, he is. Me."
256,Chandler," (entering, very upset) Ok Tommy, that's enough mourning for you! Here we go, bye bye!! (he shoves him out the door)"
258,Chandler, Ok! (shuts the door behind Tom)
259,Ross, (coming in) I'm dead and no one cares?
260,Monica, I look like a man??
261,Chandler," Please, one ridiculous problem at a time!"
262,Ross," It isn't ridiculous, look around! No one's here!"
263,Chandler," You gave them one day's notice, not everyone in our class checks the web site everyday and Monica... it's probably the way you stand!"
264,Ross," Yes, you're right. Still somebody must have seen it... I mean, I went to that school for 4 years, I didn't have an impact on anyone?"
265,Chandler," Oh, that's not true. You had an impact on me, I mean, it's 15 years later and we're still best friends. Doesn't that count for something?"
266,Ross, (sceptical) Yeah... 
268,Chandler," I'm sure it's somebody for you. Now, go hide. (Ross hides in the bedroom again)"
271,Chandler, Kori? Kori Weston?
273,Chandler, Wow! You look amazing!
275,Chandler," Chandler, Chandler Bing. I'm not gay, I'm not gay at all."
276,Monica, You are married though.
277,Chandler," Don't listen to him, he's in a really bad mood! (lets her in)"
279,Chandler, I didn't know Ross and you were so close.
281,Chandler," I'm sure that would mean a lot to him. And if heaven has a door, I'm sure he's pressing his ear up against it and listening intently."
283,Ross," (he bounds into the lounge room) But you didn't! I'm still alive!! Kori, I know this is a big surprise for you. It's a long story but the things you just said really made my day! I mean, the fact that you are here means more to me than if this room were filled with people!"
285,Ross, Did you hear that? Kori Weston had a crush on me!!
288,Ross," (on the phone) No Mum, I'm not dead. I know it's not something to kid about. It was just a practical joke between Chandler and me, but it's over, ok? (pause) Actually no, even if I had died, you would not be left childless. (pause) Monica?"
0,Joey," Monica, hey, can I borrow the Porsche?"
1,Monica, Ok.
2,Joey, Alright!
3,Monica, But ehm...what is it not?
4,Joey, (abashed) A place to entertain my lady friends.
5,Monica, And what else is it not?
6,Joey, (even more abashed) A place to eat spaghetti.
7,Monica," Very good! (Gives him the keys) What do you need it
for anyway?"
8,Joey," Oh well, the powerball lottery is upto 300 million and
they don't sell tickets here in New York, so..."
9,Rachel, Oh! So you're driving up to Connecticut?
10,Joey," (hesitates for a moment)Yeah Connecticut...Not West
Virginia."
11,Monica," Hey, maybe I'll drive you up there! I'd like to buy
some tickets myself! "
12,Joey, Uh!
13,Monica," Yeah with Chandler not getting paid, we could really
use 300 million dollars."
14,Chandler," Yeah, because if I was at my old job we'd say 300
million? No thank you!"
15,Phoebe, Hey will you get me tickets too?
16,Rachel," Yeah me too. oh! I have an idea. Why don't we all
pitch in 50 bucks, we'll pool our money together and then if we win,
we'll split it!"
18,Ross, No thanks!
19,Phoebe, You don't wanna win the lottery?
20,Ross," (in a  mocking voice)Uh...sure I do, and I also wanna
be King of my own country and find out what happened to Amelia Earhart."
21,Chandler, Still on Amelia Earhart?
22,Ross, The woman just vanished!
23,Joey," Seriously, Ross, you don't want in on this?"
24,Ross," No! Do you know what your odds are of winning the
lottery? I...I mean you have a better chance of being struck by
lightning 42 times."
25,Chandler," Yes but there's six of us so we'd only have to get
struck by lightning 7 times."
26,Joey, I like those odds!
27,Ross," Seriously you guys, I can't believe you're going to
spend 250 dollars on the lottery, I mean that's such a bunch of boohaki."
28,Chandler," (looking around at the others)I'll ask. (To Ross)
Boohaki?"
29,Ross," Oh oh, we think Emma is about to start talking so we're
trying to be careful about what words we use in front of her."
30,Rachel," Yeah so get ready to hear alot of ehm...boohaki,
goshdarnit and brotherpucker."
31,Monica, How do you know she's gonna start talking?
32,Rachel," Well when I talk to her I almost feel like she
understands what I'm saying."
33,Chandler, Kinda like Joey.
34,Joey, (who wasn't paying attention)What's that now?
37,Monica," God! Look at all these tickets! It's so exciting! You
know I haven't won anything since the sixth grade."
38,Chandler, Pie eating contest?
39,Monica," Oh! You assume because I was heavy that's the only way
I could win something? "
40,Chandler," No, I saw a picture of you covered in blueberries."
41,Monica, (smiling)That was a good day!
43,Ross," (yelling to Monica)They're towing your car, they're
towing your car!!"
44,Monica, I'm parked in a garage on Morton! 
45,Ross, (panting)They're towing a car. And I am seeing...spots.
46,Joey," (sounding panicky)Oh my god Ross! You don't have Emma!
And Rachel you don't have Emma! (Starts yelling) Where's Emma? Who has
Emma!?"
47,Rachel," Joey relax! My mother picked her up two hours ago. You
were there!"
48,Joey, (not yelling anymore)I was?
50,Joey, I did?
51,Rachel, She dropped off a casserole?
52,Joey, Oh yeah! The casserole lady.
53,Monica," (to Ross)So, did you come by to watch us win the big
bucks?"
54,Ross," Yeah, uh... and then I figured after you win, we could
all go out to the balcony and see a night rainbow with gremlins dancing
on top of it!"
56,Chandler," (hysterical)Don't touch the phone! I'll get it, I'll
get it, I'll get it!! (picks up the phone)"
57,Ross, (to Monica)Think he washed his hands?
58,Chandler," (into receiver)Hello? Hey Charlie, what do you know?"
59,Rachel, (to Monica)What's going on?
60,Monica," Chandler is supposed to find out if he's getting an
assistent job at his ad agency. But out of the 15 interns, they are
only hiring three."
61,Joey, Ooh! Tough odds!
62,Ross," (mockingly)Yeah if only it were a sure thing like your
24 state lottery!"
63,Joey, (smiling)Look who's coming around!
64,Chandler," (still on the phone)Damnit. Alright call me when
you know more."
65,Joey, (excited)Did you get it?
66,Chandler, One of the slots got filled.
67,Joey, (Still excited)By you!?
68,Chandler, Sense the tone! No that kid Nate got it.
69,Monica," Oh! I hate that guy! I mean come on kid! Pull up your
pants!"
70,Chandler, Yeah I know.
71,Rachel," Well, there's two spots left right?"
72,Chandler," Yeah...I mean I want this so much! I mean, I wanna
get one, I want my friend Charlie to get one...Except I don't care
about Charlie."
74,Phoebe," (excited)Hey you guys! Ok, you're not going to
believe this! I just saw my psychic and she said I was definitely gonna
win the lottery tonight!"
75,Monica," Hey that reminds me, I thought we could use some extra
luck so I brought a wishbone home from work."
76,Ross," (mockingly)A psychic AND a wishbone? Guys! Give someone
else a chance!"
77,Monica," Alright, who wants to do it?"
78,Phoebe," Oh can I? Vegetarians never get to do the wishbone.
It's really not fair either! You know, just because we don't eat the
meat doesn't mean we don't like to play with the carcasses!"
79,Monica," Ok, hey Rach?"
80,Rachel," Oh no, I'm good, I don't wanna get that turkey smell
all over my hands."
81,Joey, I'll do it!! It'll get the casserole stink off of mine.
83,Phoebe, I hope I win!
84,Monica," Well, it doesn't really matter ... you're both wishing
for the same thing, right?"
85,Joey," I can't tell you what I'm wishing for! Else...you
know...won't come true!"
86,Monica," Right! .. but we ""know"" what you're wishing for!"
87,Joey, Can't really say!
88,Monica," I understand, but you're wishing for what we think
you're wishing for, aren't you?"
89,Joey," (slightly irritated)I'm not really comfortable with
these questions!"
91,Phoebe," One, two, three!"
93,Joey," I won, hey!"
94,Ross," You know what, I'm sure your wish is gonna come true,
but, you guys - just in case, maybe a genie will come out if we rub
this lamp! (rubs lamp, stops because it's very hot) Ah!! That thing
gets hot!!"
95,Rachel," You know, Ross, just keep making your jokes. How are
you gonna feel if we actually do win?"
96,Ross," Uh, you're not gonna win."
97,Rachel," Oh, I know, I know, the odds are against us, but
somebody has to win, and it could be us! And then how you gonna feel?
You know, we're gonna be all like ""oh everybody, let's take our
helicopters up to the cape"" and you're gonna be all like ""oh, I can't
guys, I'll meet you guys up there, I gotta gas up the Hyundai"""
98,Ross," Ok, I've heard myself on tape and I sound nothing like
that."
99,Chandler," I can see the headline now ""Lottery winners' friend
filled with regret eats own arm""."
100,Ross, Why would I eat my own arm?
101,Chandler," Well you wouldn't, but we own the paper, we can
print whatever we want."
102,Monica," You know what, Ross? I'm gonna throw in 50 bucks for
you."
103,Ross, Why?
104,Monica," Because I know that you think the lottery is ""boohaki""
but we're all here and gonna watch the numbers and have fun. And you're
my brother, and I want you to be a part of this."
105,Ross," You don't have to do that, I'll pay for myself. But just
the fact that you want me to have fun with you guys - that's so sweet!
Come here (they kiss and hug)"
106,Phoebe, Get a room!
107,Chandler," Ok, so now that you're in, what are you gonna do if
we win?"
108,Ross," I don't know, probably just invest it."
109,Chandler, Ooh! Calm down ...
110,Joey," Seriously, that's your fantasy? To invest it? "
111,Ross," Oh, I'm sorry, did I say ""invest it""? I meant ""be cool
and piss it all away"" (Joey and Chandler pleased)"
112,Joey," Ooh, ooh, I know! We should pool all own money and buy
the Knicks!"
113,Rachel, I don't really care about the Knicks.
114,Joey," Oh, you will when I pick you as starting forward."
115,Rachel, (touched) You would do that? I never get picked!
116,Chandler," You know, I'm not sure a sports team is the way to
go."
117,Joey," You're not gonna let me buy the Knicks?? I can't believe
you're taking this away from me!"
118,Chandler," You're right, it has been you dream for over 15
seconds."
119,Ross," (to Rachel) Uh, how long until they announce the
numbers, Mommy?"
121,Chandler," (looks around) I'll take this one too (to Ross) Uh
... Mommy?"
122,Ross," Oh, I've gotten into the habit of calling Rachel ""Mommy""
when we're around Emma. Which I now realize we are not ..."
123,Rachel," I'm hoping that if she hears it enough it will be her
first word."
124,Ross," Although if we're gonna do that, we should probably call
me ""Daddy"" too."
125,Phoebe," Oooh, I like that, ""daddy"" (in a sexy tone)"
126,Ross, I ... I was just talking about Rachel.
127,Phoebe," (still in sexy tone) Oooh, is daddy getting angry? Is
daddy gonna spank me?"
128,Ross," (tries to be sexy too) Well that depends ... have you
been a baaad gi .. (stops) no I can't."
130,Chandler," Hello? Hello? Oh, hey Charlie. Did anybody else
hear? ... What? Susan got it?? How? Oh man, I would have slept with
him!! .. Alright, bye. (hangs up)"
131,Joey," Dude, I'm sorry. But hey, there's one spot left, right?"
132,Chandler," Well no, Charlie's gonna get that."
133,Monica," Hey, don't say that! You got just as good a chance as
anybody else of getting that job!"
134,Chandler, He's the boss's son.
135,Monica," Come on, lottery!! (everybody cheers)"
136,Rachel," Ooh, you guys, it starts in like 20 minutes."
137,Monica," Ok, here we go. We need to sort out the tickets as
quickly as possible to see if we've won. So does anybody have any ideas
how to organize this? (doesn't let them answer) Ok, how about this we
divide them into 6 groups of 40, and the remaining 10 can be read by
whoever finishes their pile first."
138,Rachel," Ooh, I have another idea!"
139,Monica," I'm sorry, idea time is over."
140,Phoebe," Ok, well, are all the tickets in the bowl?"
141,Monica, Yeah.
142,Chandler, What about the ones you have on the nightstand?
143,Monica, There are no tickets on the nightstand!
144,Chandler," Yes there are, I just saw them a few minutes ago."
146,Monica," Un, no you didn't! You must be mistaken!"
147,Chandler," Honey, there are like 20 tickets on the nightstand!"
148,Monica," Chandler, sense the tone!!"
150,Rachel," Well, well, well, look what mommy found!!"
152,Monica," Ok, fine!! I bought 20 extra tickets for me and
Chandler."
153,Phoebe, Uh! The psychic also said that I would be betrayed.
154,Ross," I can't believe this, I thought we were all in this
together!"
155,Monica," Hey, you just got in 5 minutes ago!"
156,Ross, 3 minutes ago!!! I don't know why that's important ...
157,Joey," I was with you the whole time we were in Connecticut,
when did you even get those?"
158,Monica," When you were reading the dirty magazines without
taking off the plastic!"
159,Joey, (to Ross) I'll show you how.
160,Rachel," Ok, well Monica, suppose one of your ""special"" tickets
win? How are you gonna feel when you win the lottery and you lose all
your friends?"
161,Monica," Please ... if I win the lottery, you guys are not
gonna leave me. Someone gave me a basket of mini-muffins last week and
I couldn't get rid of you for 3 days!"
162,Rachel," Chandler, would you just tell her what she did was
wrong?"
163,Chandler," (to Mon) She's right, you shouldn't have bought
tickets just for us ..."
164,Monica, Ahhh!  (shocked)
165,Chandler," Let me finish ... (to everyone else) however, it
doesn't look like I'm gonna get this job so I can't afford to have
principles, so screw you, the tickets are ours!! (takes tickets from
Rachel)"
166,Monica, There's the man I married!!
167,Rachel," All right, believe me.If you win the lottery, it's
the last you're gonna hear from us!"
168,Monica," Fine! Don't be my friends! I'll buy new friends!
Yeah, and then I'll pay for their plastic surgery so they'd look just
like you!"
169,Rachel," (surprised) OH! Alright, you know what? That's it! I
want my share of the tickets (picks up the bowl)!"
170,Joey," Yeah, I want my tickets too (takes the bowl from
Rachel)! And I'm buying the Knicks! And Steffi Graff, ah ah!"
171,Ross," Than I want mine, too (takes the bowl from Joey)! And
if I win I'm gonna put it all into a very low-yield bond."
172,Phoebe," Oh, you guys! We've got to keep all the tickets
together (takes the bowl from Ross and puts it on the table)"
173,Monica," No, no! We should divide them up (picks up the bowl)
and I should get extra because we used my card to buy them!"
174,Joey," Hey, if anybody gets extra tickets, it should be me!
This all thing was my idea! (takes the bowl from Monica)"
175,Chandler," Oh, yeah! Thanks for inventing the lottery!"
176,Rachel," Ok, that's it! Just give'em to me! I'll split them
up! (she tries to snatch the bowl from Joey's hands but she can't, so
she pinches his nipple and she manages to take it)"
177,Joey, (in pain) Oh!
178,Phoebe," (she takes the bowl from Rachel's hands and she
starts running around the room and yelling) OOOOOHHHHH!"
179,Ross," (trying to stop her) Hey, hey!!"
180,Phoebe," (keeping on running and yelling) OOOOOHHHHH! (she
stops) Fine, I can't take it anymore! I'm putting an end to this! (she
goes out to the balcony)"
181,Rachel," Oh, if she jumps, I get her tickets."
182,Joey," No, no! (they all go towards the balcony but they get
jammed in the window)"
183,Phoebe," If we are not doing it together, we're not doing it
at all! So, say goodbye to your tickets! (She holds out the bowl, and
makes as to drop the tickets on the street)."
185,Phoebe, Don't come any closer!
186,Chandler," Can I come a little bit closer, valuable things are
getting squished..."
187,Phoebe," No, what's more important, your friends or money?"
189,Monica, Money! (they all look at her) Friends...
190,Phoebe," Hey Monica, what about your extra tickets?"
191,Monica," They're all in there! Even these five that I hid in
my bra (takes some tickets out of her bra and gives them to Phoebe)..."
192,Ross, Monica!
193,Phoebe," Ok, good! (pause) You guys were so scared! There was
no way I was gonna dump this...(a pigeon swoops down, scaring Phoebe
who drops the bowl on the street) Oh God, no! (pause) I think I broke
your bowl."
194,Ross," Go, go, go!!"
197,Phoebe," What a beautiful night to be running around the
street, looking for tickets. And the wind sure made it fun."
198,Monica," Phoebe, we lost half of them."
199,Phoebe," So, what? Monica, we have the winning ticket! My
psychic said I  was gonna win, remember?"
200,Ross," Weird.. your psychic didn't mention anything about the
scary pigeon..."
201,Phoebe," As a matter of fact she said that's how I am going to
die. (pause ) So, excuse me for being a little skittish."
202,Chandler," (looking at the answering machine) Hey, there's two
messages. These could be from work!"
203,Monica," Oh, play them!"
204,Chandler," Ok, here we go! (he pushes the play button)"
207,Phoebe," Well, I bet that was very hard for him to do."
209,Chandler, This is..shhh!
211,Monica," Oh God, I am so sorry honey..."
213,Rachel," Oh, it is so unfair. It's like that time they
promoted Sandra over me at work."
214,Chandler," Oh, is she related to Ralph Lauren?"
215,Rachel," No, she was just much better at job than me!"
216,Phoebe," Guys, the drawing is about to start!"
217,Rachel," (To Ross) You know what? We should call my mum's
house and say goodnight to Emma before she goes down."
218,Ross," Oh yeah, it's a good idea!"
219,Monica," (she hugs Chandler) Honey, you've been really strong
about this, I know how badly you wanted that job."
220,Chandler," Yeah, you know, I really thought I deserved it.
(pause) But... let's go win the lottery... I mean, we still have 130
chances to win, right?"
221,Monica," (she draws out a ticket from a pocket of her pants)
131! (they kiss)"
222,Ross," (on the phone) Goodnight sweetheart! I love you. And
remember, you're daddy's little girl... (covering the phone, to Rachel)
Phoebe's totally ruined that for me... (he passes the receiver to
Rachel)"
223,Rachel," Hi mum, put her back on!"
224,Joey," (sitting on the sofa in front of the tv) Rach, come on!
They are announcing the numbers! My God, I can already feel myself
changing."
226,Chandler, I got that!
227,Ross," Oh, we have one too!!"
228,Monica," We are on a roll, people!!"
229,Ross, (calling Rachel) Come on!!
230,Rachel," (on the phone) Mum, please!I know you love your new
lips, but I can barely understand you! Would you, please, just let me
say goodnight to my daughter?"
232,Monica, Check your numbers! Make me rich!
233,Rachel," (she goes towards the others and she's very excited)
Guys, you're not gonna believe this! I was just saying goodnight to
Emma and she said her first words!!"
235,Joey, And what did she say?
236,Rachel," She said ""gleba""!! (she celebrates)"
238,Monica, Make me rich!!
239,Rachel, (to Ross) Isn't that amazing?
240,Ross," Oh yeah, no no no...that's great!"
241,Rachel, Why-why aren't you more excited?
242,Ross," Oh, Rach...oh...""gleba"" is not a word."
243,Rachel," Oh, but of course it is!"
244,Ross," Okay, what does it mean?"
245,Rachel, I don't know all the words.
246,Ross," I'm just, I'm just glad I didn't miss my daughter's
first words (goes back to checking the tickets)."
247,Ross," Yes you did, gleba is a word!"
248,Ross," Ok, use it in a sentence."
249,Rachel," Ok... ""Emma just said gleba""!"
250,Ross, It's not a word!
251,Rachel," Okay, okay, okay, fine, I'm gonna look it up (she goes
and picks up the dictionary)."
252,Ross," Oh, oh, ok, great. You know what, while you're at it she
said another word the other day, why don't you, why don't you look up
pbbqqt...."
254,Rachel," (searching the dictionary) Alright, okay, okay, gleba,
gleba... (excited) Gleba! Ha! Here it is the fleshy, spore-bearing
inner mass of a certain fungi."
256,Ross," She's gonna be a scientist! (kisses Rachel on the head,
very moved)"
257,Joey, (checking the last ticket) Damnit! anybody got anything?
258,Chandler, No.
259,Phoebe, I'm still looking through mine...
260,Monica," Just double checking (does so)...no, no, no...(takes off a shoe and takes a ticket out of it) No!"
262,Monica, (answering phone) Hello? Hold on. It's your boss.
263,Chandler," Ah, the ""I'm sorry I rejected you"" phone call. I'm
not used to getting it from guys. (on the phone, getting up from the
sofa) Hey, Steve."
265,Chandler," Oh no no no no, I'd love to be somebody's assistant!
Answering phones, getting coffee, I live for that stuff! And I'm not
too mature... farts, boobies, butt cracks!"
267,Chandler," Me, that guy who just said butt cracks?"
269,Chandler," Ok well, thanks, you won't regret it. I'll see you
tomorrow (hangs up)."
271,Chandler," What? (pause) Oh, yeah, I'm gonna be a junior
copywriter."
273,Monica," Oh sweetie, I'm so proud of you!"
274,Chandler, Does that mean I get the good loving tonight?
275,Monica," You bet! No TV or anything! (she gets up from the sofa
and goes to the kitchen area)"
276,Joey," (to Chandler) Hey, that is so great about the job. "
277,Chandler," Thanks, man."
278,Joey," And I like to think I had a little something to do with
it."
279,Chandler, Really? What?
280,Joey," Well, before, with the wishbone... I didn't wish we
would win the lottery, I wished you'd get the job."
281,Chandler," (smiling, surprised) Oh yeah? (looks towards the
kitchen, worried) Listen, don't tell Monica, she'll rip your heart
right out."
282,Joey, Oh yeah.
283,Rachel," You know what? There is a little part of me that
really thought we were gonna win."
284,Ross," Me too. So much for my dinosaur/Amelia Earhart theme
park."
285,Phoebe," You guys, what was the Powerball number again?"
287,Phoebe, We won.
288,Rachel, What?
289,Phoebe, We won!
290,Monica, Let me see!
292,Phoebe, Don't tear it.
293,Ross," Phoebe, you don't have any of the first five numbers."
294,Phoebe," I know that, but look, we've got the Powerball number,
we've won 3 dollars!"
295,Chandler," Wow, you'd think we should get that over 20 years or
go for the big payout."
296,Phoebe," (still very excited) I don't care, I've never won
anything before, I can't believe this!"
297,Rachel," So Pheebs, what are you going to do with your $3?"
298,Phoebe, It's not all mine. We all get 50 cents.
299,Monica, You know what? You can have mine.
300,Chandler, Me too.
301,Joey, Me too.
302,Rachel, Me too.
304,Ross, I guess if everybody else is...
308,Joey," (sitting in a chair) Hey guys, so I just called the
Powerball hotline, can you believe it? Nobody won."
309,Phoebe," I beg to differ (shows him her cup of coffee and her
plate of cookies)."
312,Phoebe," (hides her mouth behind the cup and speaks in the
""pigeon voice"" from before) Coo, again. Don't blame the pretty lady. It
was not her fault. It was me, the pigeon, coo! (pause) Seriously, stop
staring at her."
0,Joey," (talking to a pineapple in his hand) God, you're beautiful...why are we fighting this?You know you want it to happen as much as I do."
2,Joey, I want you.I need you.Let me make love to you.
3,Rachel," I don't wanna stand in the way of true love or anything, but I think a 
cantaloupe might hurt less."
4,Joey," Oh, ehm...I'm...I'm rehearsing my lines.They gave me a big romantic story on Days Of Our Lives. It's the first time my character's got one. I'm so nervous, you know, I really want it to be good!"
5,Rachel, Woow!I haven't seen you this worked up since you did that dog food commercial and you thought you were gonna be with a real talking dog!
6,Joey," Yeah, that was a disappointment...(pause) Oh, hey!D'you want to come down to the set and tell me if I'm doing ok?"
7,Rachel, (excited) Are you serious?
8,Joey," Yeah!Hey, you just have to promise not to get yourself thrown out again."
9,Rachel," Hey, that was an honest mistake!"
10,Joey," Right!(he starts to ape her)""Oh my God, is this the men's room? Oh, I feel so foolish, have you always known you wanted to be an actor?"" (he inclines his head as if to look at a man's private parts)"
11,Rachel," Yeah, that was an awesome day!"
14,Monica, Hey!
15,Phoebe, Hey!
16,Ross, Hi!
17,Monica," So, do you guys wanna come and eat dinner at the restaurant sometime in the next few weeks?"
18,Phoebe, Sure!
19,Ross, I'd love to!
20,Monica, Well you can't! We're booked solid for the next month!
21,Phoebe," Well, I can't give you a massage, because my licence has been revoked again!"
22,Ross," Phoebe, what happened?"
23,Phoebe," Well, it was an accident...You know, it's a lot of oil and sometimes the hand just slips!"
25,Chandler, (To Monica) Have I got a surprise for you? Pack your bags!
26,Phoebe, Oh no!You guys aren't supposed to get divorced for 7 years!
27,Chandler," What? No, I'm taking Monica to a romantic inn in Vermont (shows them a brochure)!"
28,Phoebe," Oh, good!Ok, good for you!Try to recapture the magic!"
29,Chandler," So, what do you say? Can you get out of work?"
30,Monica," Oh, honey!I can't. I was just telling these guys that things are crazy at the restaurant!"
31,Chandler, Are you really that busy?
32,Monica," Yeah, I'm sorry. I really am."
33,Chandler," Oh, that's ok.I'll just try and reschedule. (on the phone) ""Hi, this is Chandler Bing. I made a reservation there and I need to change it (pause) Oh, what do you mean it's not refundable? Can I just come some other time? (pause) Oh, can't you make an exception?"""
34,Monica, Tell them I'm a chef in a big New York restaurant!
35,Phoebe, And tell them that in 2 weeks I will once again be a masseuse in good standing!
36,Chandler," (on the phone) ""Look, this is ridiculous! I'm not paying for that room! Ok?"" (pause) ""Oh, thank you very much!"" (hangs up) Yeah, I'm going to Vermont..."
37,Ross," Oh, don't worry about it! Just use your travel insurance."
38,Chandler, I don't have travel insurance.
39,Ross," Well, this is what happens when people live on the edge!"
40,Monica, Why don't you take Ross?
41,Ross," Uh, don't you think that would be a little weird? I mean, two guys in a romantic inn..."
42,Monica," No, not if their room has two beds!"
43,Ross, (browsing the brochure) I guess...It still seems a little...(enthusiastically) moonlight boat ride!!
45,Rachel," Hey Joey, is this the bed where Olivia lost her virginity?"
46,Joey," I don't know, but one of the extras sure did! (pause) Hey, listen Rach. Thanks again for coming down to watch my scenes!"
47,Rachel," Oh, please!Honey, just the fact that you want me here to support you, I'm...OH MY GOD!Is that Christian Sanders?He's so gorgeous!"
48,Joey, Also so gay!
49,Rachel," Oh, in my head he's done some pretty ""not-gay-stuff""!"
50,Joey," Well, at the Christmas party him and Santa did some definitely gay stuff!"
52,Joey," Oh, wish me luck!"
53,Rachel," Ok, not that you need it but good...GOD!Is that Chase Lassiter?He's straight, right?"
54,Joey," Rach, I gotta say...if you weren't here wondering if these guys were gay I don't know if I could do this!"
55,Rachel," Oh, I'm sorry, you're right.I'm sorry, good luck! (they hug)"
67,Rachel," (watching a television where the scene is shown, startled) OH!"
71,Rachel, SSSHHHHTTT!!He's asking her a question!!
78,Rachel," NO! (pause) Or, cut!You know, that's your call!"
81,Monica, Thank you!
83,Monica, Thank you!(she looks at the 3rd customer waiting for a compliment) You haven't said anything...
85,Monica, Oh..please!I-I welcome criticism.
87,Monica, What musician?
89,Phoebe," (playing guitar and singing) And there's a country called Argentinaaaa, it's a place I've never seeeeen. But I'm told for fifty pesos you can buy a human spleen. Humaaan spleeeeen. Olè!"
90,Monica, What are you doing here!
91,Phoebe," Well, you said that you had customers lined up in the street, so I am here to entertain!"
92,Monica, Great!
93,Phoebe," Yeah! It really has been great too, you know, some of this people must have seen me play before because they were requesting a bunch of my songs! Yeah, ""You suck"" and ""shut up and go home""."
94,Monica, Listen Phoebe...
95,Phoebe, Yeah.
96,Monica," You know how much I love listening to your music, you know, but..."
97,Phoebe, But what?
98,Monica, This is kind of a classy place.
99,Phoebe," (pause) Ok, say no more."
101,Phoebe," (with a fancy dress, still playing and singing) It wasn't just that she was fat, the woman smelled like garbage! Everyone! It wasn't just that she was fat the woman smelled like garbaaaaaage! (to Monica, showing her dress) Classy, uh?"
104,Chandler," Hi, Chandler Bing, I have a reservation."
106,Chandler, New York.
107,Ross, (in a strange voice and eating candies) The big apple!
108,Chandler," I'm sorry, he's a little bit wound up, we had to stop at every maple candy stand on the way here."
109,Ross," Yeah, I ate all my gifts for everybody."
111,Chandler," Well, that's impossible, can you check again, please?"
112,Ross, (high pitched voice) Check again please!
114,Ross, Not there.
115,Chandler," Let me get this straight. I called yesterday trying to cancel my reservation and I was told it was not refundable, then we drove six hours all the way up here and now you tell me that we don't have a reservation?"
117,Ross, (mumbling) She doesn't know what to say!
118,Chandler, Just give us the cheapest room you have.
120,Chandler, That's insane!
121,Ross," Totally insane. Dude, let's drive home, we'll hit all the maple candy stores on the way back and if...if they're closed maybe we'll tap a tree and make some ourselves."
122,Chandler, Does that room have a closet I can lock him in? (pause) We'll take it.
124,Chandler," (aside, to Ross) What!? They are totally ripping us off!"
125,Ross," Dude, don't worry 'bout it! I know how we can make your money back! This is a nice hotel, you know, plenty of amenities, we just load up on those! Like those apples. Instead of taking one, I'm... I take six!"
126,Chandler," Great, at a hundred dollars an apple, we're there!"
127,Ross," C'mon, you get the idea, ow-ow-ow we'll make our money back in no time!"
128,Chandler," Dude, you're shaking!"
129,Ross," I think it's the sugar, could you hold the apple?"
131,Rachel, Hi!
132,Joey, Hey!
133,Rachel," Joey, I gotta tell ya, I've been thinking all day about that scene you did, I mean, you were amazing!"
134,Joey," Oh, you know, the writing was good, and the director is good, and... and my co-star's good but they're not as good as me!"
135,Rachel," God, you have to tell me what happens tomorrow!"
136,Joey," Ow, I'm just going over the script now! You wanna read lines with me?"
137,Rachel," Me? Oh, no, I am not an actress."
138,Joey," Oh, all right, I can ask Monica."
139,Rachel," Oh screw her, that part is mine!"
140,Joey," Right... (pause) ok, so just from the top of the page, right here."
141,Rachel," Okay. (pause).(acting) Hello Drake, I'm surprised to see you here."
147,Rachel, (pause) Kiss me.
148,Joey, What?
149,Rachel, Kiss me.
150,Joey," Ah, Rach, it doesn't say that!"
151,Rachel," No, I'm saying..."
152,Joey," but, but.."
153,Rachel, just... don't talk... (she kisses him)
155,Rachel," (waking up) Ehhh, aw! (pause). Well, that's new!"
157,Ross," (on the phone) Hi, this is Ross Geller in suite 206. It seems you forgot a couple of things. Could you have some complimentary toiletries sent up to my room? (pause) Thank you! Ok. Toothbrush, toothpaste, razor, mouthwash, deodorant, dental floss, band aids, shaving cream, after shave... and I feel like I am forgetting something... Is there anything else you have that I haven't asked for already? (pause) Yeah, go ahead, send up some tampons. "
159,Ross, What did you get?
160,Chandler, USA Today
161,Ross," Nice, put it with the others."
162,Chandler, And I also got... two more apples.
163,Ross," We are four short of a bush-o (pause). God I feel so alive, I love being in the country!  "
164,Chandler, I also got this great salt and pepper shaker from the restaurant.
165,Ross," Oh, that's not cool."
167,Ross," No, Chandler, you have to find the line between stealing and taking what the hotel owes you. For example hair drier, no, no, no, but shampoo and conditioners, yes, yes, yes. (pause) Now, the salt shaker is off-limits, but the salt (he opens the salt shaker and pours the salt into his hand) I wish I'd thought this through."
168,Chandler," I think I know what you mean though...the lamp is the hotel's, but the bulbs (goes to take the bulb)...oh, you already got that."
169,Ross," Not my first time in a hotel, my friend."
170,Chandler," Ok, how about this (picks up the remote control)?"
171,Ross," No, no, no, you can't take the remote control!"
172,Chandler," Yes, but the batteries..."
174,Chandler," Thank you, thank you very much!"
175,Ross, Let's celebrate with some maple candy!
176,Chandler, No!
177,Ross, At least tell me where you hid it.
179,Rachel, Can I ask you a question?
180,Monica, Yeah.
181,Rachel, Have you ever had any weird romantic dreams?
182,Monica," Let me think. Oh, when I was younger I used to dream that I got married to Mayor McCheese, and on our wedding night I ate his head."
183,Rachel," Ok, well this is like that...in no way. I had a...I had a dream last night that I wanted to kiss Joey."
184,Monica," Wow, do you mean like kiss him-kiss him?"
185,Rachel," Oh yeah! I mean, that was pretty intense."
186,Monica, What do you think brought than on?
187,Rachel," I don't know! I mean, maybe that's something to do with the fact that I saw him do a love scene yesterday."
188,Monica, A love scene? With who?
189,Rachel, Olivia.
190,Monica," Olivia? I thought she was marrying Connor! (pause) Oh right, real life more important."
191,Rachel, So do you think that my dream means anything?
192,Monica," I don't know. I mean, you saw him do a love scene, so maybe you don't have a thing for Joey, maybe you have a thing for Drake."
193,Rachel, Ah! Well it was Joey reading Drake's lines in the dream...
194,Monica," Of course it was! Trust me, when it comes to psychology I know what I'm talking about. I took two psych classes in college. "
195,Rachel, You took the same class twice.
196,Monica, It was hard!
198,Phoebe, Hey!
200,Phoebe," Here, Monica, look what I got to wear when I play at the restaurant (she dons a top hat) uh, huh wait! (she raises a pair of spectacles to her eyes) Right? I mean, this might even class up the ballad of the uncircumcised man."
201,Monica," Oh...Phoebe? Maybe I wasn't clear before. I really love listening to your music here, but my restaurant is sort of an upscale place."
202,Phoebe," Right, yeah, ok, I'll ask the butler to fetch my diamonds out of the vault."
203,Monica," Phoebe, it's not what you wear. It's sort of your songs... I just don't think you should play at the restaurant anymore."
204,Phoebe," Oh, ok. Fine, I'll just, I'll take the hat back (she puts the hat in a bag and she crushes it angrily on the floor with her foot)."
206,Rachel," Hey, so you guys, the funniest thing happened, at work..."
207,Phoebe, My songs aren't good enough for your restaurant?
208,Rachel," Ok, we're still on that."
209,Monica, I didn't say your songs were not good enough.
210,Phoebe, Then what's wrong with them? Would they not go with your tiny portions of pretentious food?
211,Monica, Tiny portions?
212,Phoebe," Yeah well, ""excuse me, I ordered the smoked salmon appetizer, but (peering through her spectacles) I can't see it, I can't see it""!"
213,Monica," Phoebe, it's not about quantity."
214,Phoebe, Well...it's not about quality.
215,Monica," Oh really, you want to talk about quality? Have you heard of a key? It's what some people sing in."
216,Phoebe," Well at least all my songs don't taste like garlic. Yeah, there are other ingredients Monica."
217,Monica," Ok, so that's what we're doing. You know, when I'm in the coffee house bopping along to one of your songs, I'm wearing ear plugs."
218,Phoebe," Ear plugs, or cloves of garlic?"
219,Monica," You know what? I take back what I said before. You keep playing at the restaurant, because with your music driving people inside, my bar sales are going up like crazy."
220,Phoebe," What are people having, the garlic Martini?"
223,Chandler," Oh we did, and you still have all your lamps."
225,Chandler," Oh, I didn't factor in the room tax."
226,Ross," Oh dude, don't worry about it, I found an unattended maid's car. We're way ahead of the game."
228,Ross, Oh my god.
229,Chandler, What?
230,Ross, There's something new in the bowl.
231,Chandler," Look, we have enough, just walk away."
232,Ross," No, but I want...I want the pinecones!"
233,Chandler, There's a forest right outside.
234,Ross, It's not the same.
235,Chandler," Ok, go quick!"
237,Ross, (to the receptionist) Thank you for a delightful stay.
239,Ross," Oh, my maple candy!"
241,Phoebe, (singing) Food here at 'Javu'..will kill you..the food here at 'Javu' ...will kill you..
243,Monica," Thank god, it's just you! I thought someone was swinging a bag of cats against the wall."
244,Phoebe," You'd better get back in that kitchen Monica, the garlic is not gonna overuse itself."
245,Monica," Ok, you have to stop playing now."
246,Phoebe, Why? The only person my playing is bothering is you!
247,Monica," Oh yeah? Ok, let's settle this, come on!"
248,Phoebe, (while Monica drags her in the restaurant) Get your garlic-peelers off me!
249,Monica," (to the restuarant customers) Excuse me, excuse me, hi, I'm Monica Geller..I'm the head chef here.. (pauses as if waiting for something).. Ok, I was actually expecting a little applause there, but whatever! Ok, quick question by a show of hands, how many of you were bothered by this woman's singing outside? (a few people raise their hands)"
250,Phoebe," Ok, ok, how many of you enjoyed the music outside? (a few people raise their hands) Ha!"
251,Monica," Alright, let me ask you this question How many of you thought the music was fine, but not in keeping with the tone of the restaurant? (a few raise their hands again)."
252,Phoebe," Ok, well, who identified the tone of this restaurant as pretentious comma garlicky?"
253,Monica, Ok who thinks the food is delicious and a little pretention never hurt anyone? (a few raise their hands)
254,Phoebe," Ok, well, alright, who thinks the food is fine, the music was fine, but your evening was ruined by this incessant poll taking? (all raise their hands)."
255,Monica, Excuse us! (then to Phoebe) Alright here's a question Who was so worried about her restaurant being fancy that she made a big deal about her friend playing her music and feels really bad about it now? (raises her hand)
256,Phoebe, Oh...Who was so stupid and stubborn that she lashed out against her friend's cooking which she actually thinks is pretty great! (raises her hand)
257,Monica, I'm sorry...
258,Phoebe, I'm sorry too... (they hug)
259,Monica, ooohh... hey! Wanna stick around and I'll whip you up some dinner? 
260,Phoebe, Yeah! As long as it's free! Food here is ridiculously over-p... 
262,Phoebe," (smiling, raising her hand) Who's hoping the hand raising thing is still cute enough that you won't hate me?"
264,Rachel, Hey!
265,Joey, Hey!
266,Rachel," Joey, do you have peanut butter on the back of your head?"
267,Joey, (Touches the back of his head and licks his fingers) Oh man! I thought I got it all!
268,Rachel, (looks puzzled) How...how...?
269,Joey," I was making a peanut butter smoothy, right? "
270,Rachel, uh-huh
271,Joey," And I couldn't find this little plastic thing (holds up plastic thing) that goes on top of the blender...and I thought...well... how important can that be, right...? Turns out very! "
272,Rachel, (to herself) Wow...definitely just Drake...
273,Joey, What?
274,Rachel, What...how is it going with Drake?
275,Joey, Oh...I don't think it's going very well...
276,Rachel, What...that scene I saw was so good!
277,Joey," Well, I'm feeling really insecure about the one we are shooting tomorrow..."
278,Rachel," Joey, is this that thing that you do when you say you're bad so I'll give you a compliment?"
279,Joey," A little. Yeah no, I really am worried, you know, I mean I have to make it convincing that I'm in love with Olivia."
280,Rachel, So?
281,Joey, So...I've never played that!
282,Rachel," Ooh! Honey, it can't be that hard, I mean, you've been in love before?"
283,Joey, Uh...well...just once...with you...
284,Rachel, Ok...this could be a little awkward...I'm just going to blow past it... well can't you just use that method actor thing where you use your real life memories to help you in your performance?
285,Joey, (looks at her for a moment) What the hell are you talking about??
286,Rachel," (shakes her head) Alright, alright look, just uh... just try to remember how  you felt when you were in love, and think about that when you're playing the scene."
287,Joey," (approvingly) Oh! ok, yeah, I think I can do that. Yeah ok, there's this party scene coming up.. and Olivia and her husband are there and all Drake wants to do is grab her and kiss her, but he can't... And that makes me think about all those times when I wanted to grab you and kiss you, but you didn't know so I would just pretend everything was cool, but really, it was killing me."
288,Rachel," (looks touched) Joey, you never..you never talked about that before..."
289,Joey," Well.. hey, you know what else I could use? There's a scene where Drake sneaks into Olivia's bedroom, and she doesn't know he's there - which never happened with us! And he knows he shouldn't be there, but he just wants to look at her... you know? (In a romantic voice) And I remember all those mornings before you even put on your make-up, when I would think to myself, my God, she...is... beautiful... (Rachel looks very moved) and it hurts so much, cuz I knew I could never tell you (pauses, while looking at her with sentiment) but it was worth it just to be there looking at you."
291,Joey, (excited) Thanks dude!!!This is GREAT!! (leaves Rachel very touched on the couch and goes into his room)
294,Chandler, I got you something from Vermont! (Sits down at the table)
295,Monica, (without looking up from what she's doing) Besides tampons and salt? (Then looks) Ooh! My God! Maple candy! That's so sweet of you. (Opens the box) That's weird...it's empty!
297,Ross," (sounds excited) Hi you guys! what's going on, you... you guys wanna hang out...or...? (Looks around the room nervously) do you...do you guys hear a buzzing?"
0,Joey," (enters the room) Hey, you guys, what are you doing tomorrow night?"
1,Chandler," (browsing through a diary) Well, let me see... I-I believe I'm... yes, falling asleep in front of the TV."
2,Joey," Look, my agent hooked me up with six tickets to a great play."
3,Chandler, I could fall asleep at a play.
4,Phoebe, What is it?
5,Joey," It's a one-woman play called ""Why don't you like me a bitter woman's journey through life""."
6,Monica, It sounds interesting!
7,Ross," Yeah, it does sound interesting, I mean, to listen to a woman complain for two hours, I don't think it gets bett... (Ross starts snoring, faking to fall asleep)"
8,Phoebe," I know, I know, we can drive, we can vote, we can work, what more do these broads want?"
9,Joey," You guys are gonna have a great time, I promise!"
10,Ross, What? How come that you don't have to go!
11,Joey," I wish I could but I just found out that I have to be at work really early the next day, so I can't go, but, you know, take the extra ticket and invite whoever you want."
12,Chandler," (browsing through a diary) Uh, let's see, who do I hate?"
13,Rachel," (gets up from the sofa and moves to the kitchen but Joey blocks her way) Oh, sorry... Oops, sorry."
14,Joey," (lifts Rachel up and moves her behind him so she can walk on) Hey, here you go."
15,Rachel," Ooh... oooh... (pause) (Rachel is all bah-jiggity about Joey) oh, ah... (pause) (to Monica) Can I ask you a question?"
16,Monica, Yeah.
17,Rachel, Do you think it's possible for two friends to fool around and... and not have it be a big deal?
18,Monica," No, I don't think it ever works. Why?"
19,Rachel, No reason.
20,Monica," No, no, Rachel?"
21,Rachel, Yeah
22,Monica, Who do you wanna fool around with?
23,Rachel," (with high pitched voice) Nobody, forget it!"
25,Rachel, (giggling and whispering) Maybe.
26,Monica, (whispering) You can't!
27,Rachel," (whispering) Why? (Monica gesticulates mumbling something that starts with ""because"") Seriously I did not understand a word that you said."
28,Monica, In the hall.
30,Monica, You wanna fool around with Joey?
31,Rachel," Yeah! You know, ever since I had that dream about him, and can't get it out of my head! And what's the big deal, people do it all the time!"
32,Monica, Who? Who do you know that are friends that just fool around?
33,Rachel," Ok, off the top of my head... Don and Janet."
34,Monica," Who, who are they?"
35,Rachel, I know them from work.
36,Monica, Both of them?
37,Rachel," No, one of them..."
38,Monica, Which one?
39,Rachel," I don't know, what were the names I just said?"
40,Monica," Rachel, things can get incredibly complicated."
41,Rachel," All right, all right, you're right, I won't do anything with Joey, I just thought that we (Joey enters the hall) Ok so that would be two cups of tarragon, one pound of baking soda and one red onion? (Joey enters his apartment)"
42,Monica, What the hell are you cooking!
45,Ross, Hey!
46,Monica, Hey!
47,Chandler, Hey!
48,Ross," Hey, you guys won't believe what I have to do for work today."
49,Chandler," Yes, but, Ross you chose a career of talking about dinosaurs."
50,Ross," (covering with his hand Chandler's face, like pretending he's not there) (to Monica) There're these two professors who are joining my department and I have to meet them here and show them around campus."
51,Monica, What's so bad about that?
52,Ross, It's I just know they're gonna be a couple of windbags wearing tweed jackets with suede elbow patches.
53,Monica, (fingering her elbow) Ross?
54,Ross," (looking his elbow, where there's a patch) These aren't suede."
58,Ross," Hi, hi, I'm Ross Geller."
60,Ross," Oh, oh, that's, that's, that's nice."
62,Ross," Oh, no, it's no big deal, I mean, if I weren't doing this I'd just, you know, be at the gym working out."
63,Monica, (to Chandler) Is he gonna introduce us?
64,Chandler," (to Monica) No, I think we're just blurry shapes to him now."
66,Ross," Oh, ha, I wrote that in one minute."
67,Monica, (to chandler) Twenty bucks says they're married within the month.
68,Ross," (hitting Monica with his suitcase) (to Charlie) We should probably get going, you know, we got a lot of ground to cover."
70,Ross, I don't think so.
72,Ross," Oh, well he's obviously late and the rule in my class is ""if you can't come on time, then don't come at all"". (pause) An option that many of my students use. (pause) Shall we?"
74,Ross," You know what, he's a big boy, I'm sure he'll find us, ok?"
76,Ross," Oh, damn it!"
80,Joey, (entering the room) Hey!
81,Rachel, Hey!
82,Joey, What's happenin'?
83,Rachel," Yeah, it's a real shame you can't make it to that one-woman show tonight."
84,Joey," Oh, I'd love to, but I gotta get up so early the next day and so, you know me, work comes first"
85,Rachel," Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah... (she plays the answering machine)"
87,Joey, (yelling) Stupid Jane Rogers!!
88,Rachel, (angry) You are having a party tonight??
89,Joey, Kinda have a... a thing for the Days Of Our Life's people.
90,Rachel, And you weren't going to tell us? How did you think you were gonna get away with that?
91,Joey, I do it every year.
92,Rachel, You do that every year??
93,Joey, I didn't have to tell you that!! I'm stupider than Jane Rogers!!
94,Rachel," Oh, that's why you got these tickets to that play, to get rid of us??"
95,Joey, Yeah...
96,Rachel, And last year is that why you sent us to that medieval times restaurant?
97,Joey, Yeah...
98,Rachel," OH! And the year before that, when you set up that nighttime tour of that button factory?"
99,Joey, (Smiling) I can't believe you guys went for that one!
100,Rachel," Joey, why wouldn't you invite us to your parties?"
101,Joey," You're fine, ok? But everyone else acts like an idiot around famous people!"
102,Rachel," Well, then so you just invite me...!"
103,Joey," (speaking aloud) Please, I was trying to be nice, you're the worst one!"
104,Rachel," Oh, Joey, come on! Please, please! Let me come, I will behave, I promise! I will behave! Please, please, please..."
105,Joey," Ok, ok! Fine! You can come, but don't tell anybody else. It's up on the roof at 8."
106,Rachel," (yelling and jumping like a child) OH, a soap opera roof party!! I'm going to a soap opera roof party!! Oh my God, oh my God!! (realizing how she's behaving) And it's out of my system!"
109,Ross," (very bored, he tries to avoid the conversation speaking to Charlie) So, where did you get your undergraduate degree?"
111,Ross," (to Charlie) Oh, it's not over!"
113,Ross, So basically all nuts?
118,Ross, I've lost the will to live.
120,Ross, What?
122,Ross," Oh... ok, fine. But... ehm... I just have one question for you, ehm... (aping Professor Spafford) When we exit should we walk, or run, or prance, or stroll..."
125,Ross," (entering with Charlie) Oh, hey you guys! This is Charlie! Charlie, this is Phoebe and my sister, Monica."
126,Phoebe, Hi!
127,Ross," Yeah, Charlie is gonna be joining my department."
128,Phoebe," Oh, you're a paleonthologist, too! (pause) Oh, ok, now, what do you think of Ranion's new theory of species' variegation in segmented arthopods?"
130,Phoebe," Ah, ah."
132,Ross, (to Phoebe) Ranion's theory of species variegation?
133,Phoebe," Yeah, I saw the article on your coffee table and I memorized the title to freak you out!"
134,Monica," (to Ross) So, did you two have fun?"
135,Ross," Oh my God, she's great! I mean, we-we have so much in common and she's just cool, and funny..."
136,Monica, And I don't know if you've noticed but she's a (aloud) HOTTY!! (Charlie looks at her) HI!
137,Rachel," (she enters wearing a bath-robe) Hey... Hi you guys! Listen, you know what? I'm not feeling really well. I think I can't get out for the play."
138,Ross, Really? Wh-what's wrong?
139,Rachel," I don't know! I think it's kind of serious! Oh, you know... I was watching this thing on TV this morning about... Newcastle disease... and I think I might have it!!"
141,Rachel," ... Ok, who is this?"
142,Ross," I'm sorry, Rachel, this is Charlie Wealer, she's a collegue."
143,Rachel," Oh, hi! I would check your hand but... I'm sure you don't want to get my chicken disease!"
144,Monica," Hey, Rachel, Can-can I see you for a sec?"
145,Rachel, Sure! (Monica takes her apart) Oh...
146,Monica, You're not sick!
147,Rachel," What? Yes, I am!"
148,Monica," Ok, then, why are you... (she opens her robe revealing a nice black dress) all dressed up??"
149,Rachel," When you're sick, you do whatever you can to make yourself feel better! (she closes her robe)"
150,Monica, You just wanna stay home so you can make a move on Joey!
151,Rachel," Oh, no, no! I heard you before, that is so not what this is!"
152,Monica," Ok, what is this?"
153,Rachel, Ok! (whispering) Joey is having a secret Days Of Our Lives party up on the roof and he sent you guys to the play to get rid of you!
154,Monica, (aloud) WHAT?
155,Ross, (looking at them) Wh-what's going on?
156,Monica, Joey is having a secret Days Of Our Lives party up on the roof!
157,Rachel, And he didn't want you guys to know about it but I came over here to tell you!!
159,Rachel, Ok professor or detective?
160,Phoebe, Joey's having a party and he wasn't gonna invite us?
161,Rachel," Yeah, and he does it every year! That's why he's sending you to that play! That's why he sent us to that medieval restaurant and to that button factory!"
162,Phoebe, And that horrible museum tour!
163,Ross," No, I arranged that..."
165,Joey," (sounds tired) Hey you guys, I'm turning in. Have fun."
166,Phoebe, We know about your party Joey.
167,Joey, What party?
168,Monica, The game's over! Take off your robe!
169,Joey, (looks perplexed and opens up his robe) Ok... I mean...
171,Joey, (to Charlie after covering himself up again) Nice to meet ya! (Charlie waves hesitantly and Joey leaves)
173,Joey," (To some people) Hey! Hey alright! Hey, glad you could make it (Shakes a man's hand) Thanks for coming."
174,Monica, Oh my God! Kyle Lowder!
176,Monica, (Yells after him) I love you!
177,Joey," Hey, that's why I didn't invite you. you have to calm down, alright... go, go get yourself a drink or something..."
178,Monica, Oh yeah that's what you want - my inhibitions lowered.
179,Phoebe, Hey!
180,Monica," (Excited) Oh my God, can you believe we are surrounded by all this? I can barely control myself."
181,Phoebe," Monica, you might want to remember that you are married. Where is Chandler anyway? (Looks around)"
182,Monica, (Shocked) Oh my God! Chandler!
184,Chandler, Where the hell is everybody?
188,Monica," (to Rachel) Hey! Joey said no autographs! But if she's gettting one, then I want one too To Monica. And none of this ""best wishes"" crap. I want ""love""."
189,Rachel," Ok actually Mon, Matthew was just giving me his phone number."
190,Monica, Oh man! If I had known I was coming to this party I never would have gotten married!
192,Rachel, Nice to meet you.
194,Rachel, Ok
196,Monica, (yelling after him) We will!!
197,Monica, (to Rachel) Look at you with all the guys!
198,Rachel, Yeah!
199,Monica, I guess you have forgotten all about Joey?
200,Rachel," Yeah, well, I guess I have forgotten about Joey and clearly you've forgotten about Chandler!"
201,Monica, Please... Chandler is the love of my life... (At which point a man in leather pants walks by)... oooh leather pants! Have Mercy! (Follows the man in the leather)
203,Ross," (to Charlie) So, eh... it's probably gonna be hard for you to leave Boston, huh?"
205,Ross," Ooh... so sad... Still, it can't be easy for you to leave Harvard? Especially after working alongside a Nobel Prize winner like Albert Wintermeyer?"
207,Ross, You... you dated Albert Wintermeyer?
209,Ross, ... And you called him Alby!? (laughs) I mean that's like... like calling Albert Einstein... er... Alby...
211,Ross," Eh, you think? I mean, you went out with a guy who improved the accuracy of radiocarbon dating by a factor of 10!"
213,Ross," (very interested) Oh! like what?! (Charlie looks at him confused, but smiling) Oh I'm sorry, I don't mean to pry... it's just that this must be what regular people experience when they watch ""Access Hollywood""."
215,Ross, Who is intimidating to a guy who won the Nobel Prize?
217,Ross, (a little suprised) Two? Wha...? Don't tell me you dated Benjamin Hobart
219,Ross, Oh my God! Have you ever been in a relationship with someone who hasn't won the Nobel Prize?
221,Ross," Oh yeah? no, no Nobel Prizes for him?"
223,Ross, Huh... huh... what a loser! Some more wine? (takes the half-full glasses and goes to the counter)
224,Phoebe, Hey Ross!
226,Ross, (sarcastically) Oh Great! After I finish my wine I'm going to blow my... eh. average-sized brains out.
227,Phoebe," Oh, What's the matter?"
228,Ross," She... she only dates geniuses and Nobel Prize winners. Oh my God, at the chinese restaurant earlier today, I put chopsticks in my mouth and pretented to be a woolly mammoth."
229,Rachel, I always loved that!!
230,Ross," Of course you would, your brains are smaller than mine!! (Rachel nods) Man, I can't compete with the guys she goes out with, they are so out of my league! oh my God!"
231,Phoebe, Worse?
232,Ross," Oh much, much worse. I did my impression of Joan Rivers as one of the earliest amphibians... (gestures with his hands and says in an impression voice?) ""Can we walk""? (Phoebe starts laughing) Oh, you... you like that?"
233,Phoebe, (still laughing) No. (points to Rachel who stuck two straws in her mouth to look like a mammoth's tusks)
234,Ross, What? (turns around to look at Rachel)
235,Rachel, Come on! I think this is funny! (Ross leaves)
238,Chandler," (To himself) oh yes, God yes!!"
240,Chandler, I... I don't know... you seem lovely.
242,Joey," Hey Ross, this is one of my co-stars, Dirk. (To Dirk) Dirk, this is my good friend Ross. (Ross and Dirk shake hands)"
243,Ross, Nice to meet you.
245,Ross," Oh, I'm no actor, I'm a professor of palaeontology."
247,Joey, It's a science.
250,Joey," Hey Ross, listen, Dirk was wondering about the woman that you brought and if you guys were together, or..."
251,Ross," Oh, well no, but I mean, she only goes out with really, really smart guys."
253,Ross, I'd lead with that.
255,Monica," That's it, just sign right on the bra (the actor does so)."
256,Joey, Monica!
257,Monica," Don't worry Joe, I won't come next year!"
259,Joey, (To Rachel) What have you got there?
260,Ross, Just some boys gave me their phone numbers.
261,Joey," Ah, let me see! (she hands him a pile of tissues) Damn, that's a lot of guys! Are you a little slutty?"
262,Rachel, (drunken voice) I think I am.
263,Joey," (browsing the tissues) Let me see if I approve any of these clowns. This guy wears a rug (discards one). This guy's Canadian (discards another). And this guy is in a cult, ok, and it costs you 5,000$ to get to level three and I don't feel any different."
265,Joey," (discarding all the remaining tissues one by one) Pass, pass, oh, pass, double-pass, pass..."
266,Rachel," (picking up the tissues) Why, why, what's wrong with these guys?"
267,Joey," Nothing major, it's just that, you know, they're not really good enough for you, and you deserve the best."
268,Rachel," Joey, you're so sweet."
269,Joey," That's true. But you know what, it doesn't matter because I already know who you're gonna go home with tonight."
270,Rachel, Who (looks around)?
272,Joey, Me.
273,Rachel, (surprised) What? (with a nervous smile) Really?
274,Joey," Yes, 'cause we live together, that's a joke!"
275,Rachel," Oh! Screw it, I didn't get it! (they high-five)"
276,Joey, Gotcha.
277,Rachel," Oh, Very funny... Joey."
280,Chandler," (to Monica) So, how did you enjoy the play?"
281,Monica," Oh my god, honey, I'm so so so so so sorry."
282,Chandler, Well you should be. You missed the most powerful three hours in the history of the theater.
283,Monica, You really liked it?
284,Chandler," Oh yeah! I mean at first I hated it, but why wouldn't I, because as a man I've been trained (bitter woman's tone) not to listen! (pause) But after chapter 16 ""fat, single and ready to mingle"", I was uplifted."
285,Monica, Oh really!
286,Chandler," Oh yeah, I had no idea the amazing journey you go through as a woman! Tell me, tell me about your first period!"
287,Monica, No!
288,Chandler, Did somebody sign your bra?
289,Monica, So I got it when I was 13...
291,Phoebe," Hey Ross! So listen, about you and the dinosaur girl, are you really just gonna let a couple of Nobel prizes scare you off? What is that, come on, a piece of paper?"
292,Ross," It's actually a 1,000,000$ prize."
293,Phoebe," Go Charlie! But my point is, ok so she dated them but she also broke up with them. Maybe she's looking to, you know, 
slum it with some average Joe Phd."
294,Ross," Yeah, maybe. I do have my whole career in front of me. I mean, I can still win a Nobel prize. Although the last two papers I've written were widely discredited."
295,Phoebe," You're so much more than just brains! You're sweet, and kind, and funny..."
296,Ross, And sexy.
297,Phoebe, Ok well give her a chance to see all of that!
298,Ross," Yeah, you're right, thanks Pheebs, I'm gonna go find her."
299,Phoebe," Good for you! And hey, I thought your paper on punctuated equilibrium in the Devonian era was top notch!"
300,Ross, Stop going through my stuff (walks away)!
302,Rachel, (to Monica) Hey!
303,Monica, Hey!
304,Rachel," I just wanted to let you know I've changed my mind I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna kiss Joey."
305,Monica," No, you can't! Friends hooking up is a bad idea."
306,Rachel," Please, what about you and Chandler?"
307,Monica, That's different! I was drunk and stupid!
308,Rachel, Well hello (points to herself)!
309,Monica, What about all the guys that you've got the phone numbers from? Why don't you just kiss one of them?
310,Rachel," I could, I could but I don't want to! I want to kiss Joey!"
311,Monica, Alright (shrugs). I think it's a big mistake but it's your decision.
312,Rachel, (pause) I'm gonna do it.
313,Monica, And I can't stop you.
314,Rachel, No.
316,Ross," (to Rachel) Hey Rach, have you seen Charlie anywhere?"
318,Ross, I'm smarter than him!
321,Phoebe," Hey, thank you so much for these tickets, Chandler."
322,Chandler," Oh well, this was a really important experience for me, and I wanted to share it with you."
323,Monica," Oh, you're so wonderful."
325,Chandler," Can't believe you guys bought that, enjoy your slow death (runs away)."
0,Monica," It's so weird, how did Joey end up kissing Charlie last night? 
  I thought you'd end up kissing Charlie."
1,Ross," Hey, I thought I'd end up kissing Charlie too ok? But SURPRISE!"
2,Chandler," I missed most of the party (pause) Charlie's a girl, right?"
3,Ross," Yes, she is this new professor of my department that I did 
  not kiss."
4,Rachel," I don't know why Joey had to kiss her! I mean, of all the girls 
  at the party, GOD!"
5,Ross, Why do you care so much?
6,Monica," Yes Rachel, why do you care so much?"
7,Rachel," (worried) Be-cause Ross is the father of my child! You know... 
  and I... want him to hook up with lots of women! (pause) I just... All I'm saying 
  is... I don't think that Joey and Charlie have anything in common."
8,Ross," Oh, I don't know, they seem to have a shared interest in each 
  other's tonsils..."
9,Phoebe," Wow, Joey and a professor! Can you imagine if they had kids 
  and if the kids got her intelligence and Joey's raw sexual magnetism... Oh, 
  those nerds will get laaaaaid!"
10,Rachel," All right, so... Ross, you're ok with all this? I mean..."
11,Ross," Yeah, it's no big deal. I mean, I just met her and I'm fine with 
  it..."
13,Ross," Oh, God. I forgot how hot she was!"
14,Joey, Hey!
16,Ross, I'm gonna get some more coffee.
18,Ross, Ok. (they both go)
19,Chandler," (to Joey) So, a professor, uh?"
20,Joey," Yeah! She is cool, and she's so smart! Her mind is totally acrimonious 
  (which, being Joey, he mispronounces ""amonious""). (pause) That's not 
  how she used it...?"
22,Ross," Uhm no! Think less of you! No, I don't think less of you. I mean, 
  you saw someone you liked and you kissed them. I mean, those people who like 
  someone and don't kiss them... those-those people are stupid, I hate those people."
24,Ross," Yeah, I know the type."
25,Joey," Hey, if you wanna grab a bite before work we'd better get acrimonious. 
  No? Am I getting close?"
28,Phoebe, (entering) Hey!
29,Monica, Hey!
30,Phoebe," Hey you guys! Look what I just got. (she shows them a pair of 
  slippers)"
31,Rachel," Oh, OH! Wow, I love those! Where did you get them?"
32,Phoebe," I bought them off Ebay! They used to belong to the late Shania 
  Twain."
33,Rachel," (after a pause) Phoebe, Shania Twain is still alive!"
34,Phoebe, Oh... then I overpaid. (she goes to the bathroom)
35,Monica," Hey, what's this?"
36,Rachel," Oh, it's a gift certificate to this new SPA in SOHO."
37,Monica," Oh, you can't show Phoebe this! She hates those corporate massage 
  chains."
38,Rachel," Ah, why, now I can't get a massage? There are so many things 
  that she disapproves of! I can't eat veal, I can't wear fur, I can't go hunting..."
39,Monica, Do you wanna go hunting?
40,Rachel," Well, I would like to have the option!!"
41,Phoebe," (coming back from the bathroom) What's up? (she sees the gift 
  certificate in Rachel's hands) Hey, Rachel!!"
42,Rachel, Oh!
43,Phoebe," No, you can't go there! You know how I feel about these ""big 
  massage places""! They're putting people like me out of business!"
44,Monica," And she wants to go hunting, too!!"
45,Rachel," Phoebe, come on, I don't wanna waste it! It would be like throwing 
  away a hundred bucks!"
46,Phoebe," Ok, this is not about the MONEY, ok? It's about... it's 
  about corporate greed destroying our hearts and leaving us... the hollow shells."
47,Rachel, I don't care about any of that!!
48,Phoebe," Well, do you care about friendship?"
49,Rachel, Oh!
50,Phoebe," I feel really strongly about this, Rachel. Please, don't use 
  this gift certificate. I'm asking you as a friend."
51,Rachel," Oh, not as a friend, Phoebe!! Fine, I won't use it!"
52,Phoebe, Promise?
53,Rachel, I promise.
54,Phoebe, Thank you. (she tears up the gift certificate)
55,Rachel, But I am going hunting!!
57,Monica, (entering) Hey honey! I missed you today!
58,Chandler," Oh, yeah?"
59,Monica, Yeah. (they kiss) What d'you wanna do tonight?
60,Chandler," Oh, well... Maybe we could... (he sweeps the stuff off the 
  table and wordlessly invites Monica to have sex on it)"
61,Monica," Ok, trying to turn me on by making a mess? Know your audience! 
  Besides, tomorrow we're doing those fertility tests and until then you need 
  to keep your tadpoles in the tank."
62,Chandler, We really need to take those tests?
63,Monica," Honey, we've been trying to have a baby for over a year. I think 
  it's a good idea to find out if everything's ok. Just a few routine tests."
64,Chandler, But I don't wanna do it in a cup!
65,Monica, What is the big deal?
66,Chandler, It's weird! In a doctor's office?
67,Monica," It's not ok to do it in a doctor's office but it is ok to do 
  it in a parked car behind a Taco Bell?"
68,Chandler," (embarrassed) I cannot believe Ross told you that! (pause) 
  And in my defense, it was a Wendy's!"
69,Monica," Look, I don't wanna do this test either, but I really do think 
  it's a good idea!"
70,Chandler," Yeah, ok. I'm sure that doctor's office can't be worst than 
  on a class trip to the Hershey's factory!"
71,Monica, (really embarrassed) OH!
72,Chandler," Oh, yeah! RACHEL TALKS TOO!"
74,Joey," (sipping red wine from a glass) Who says that wine has to cost 
  more than milk!"
76,Joey, Heeey!
78,Joey," Come on in, how are ya?"
80,Joey, Can I offer you a drink?
82,Joey," Uh-oh. I hade a pretty hectic day at work too, today I had to 
  open a door and go (looking scared) ohhhh!"
84,Joey," Hey, if you need a tour guide... (point to himself)"
86,Joey," Yeah, definitely, definitely. Ok, what do you wanna see first?"
88,Joey, (looking puzzled and nodding) Ok!
90,Joey," I know, yeah!"
92,Joey," Ok, let me stop you right there. The Mets suck, ok? You wanna 
  see the Yankees."
94,Joey," Which one, they all suck!"
96,Joey, (looking puzzled) I don't think so.
98,Rachel, (to the receptionist) Hi there!
100,Rachel," Oh, hi. I have a massage appointment under Rachel Green, and 
  here is my gift certificate."
102,Rachel, And... taped back together.
104,Rachel, Ok
106,Rachel, (imitating the receptionist's tone) through the glass doors.
108,Rachel, Alright-y then.
111,Phoebe," Ok. Do we have to talk like that then they're not around? (She 
  sees Rachel) Oh, no, no! Listen, is there someone 
  who can fill in for me?"
113,Phoebe," But that woman can't know I work 
  here. She's a friend of mine and I made this big stink about how awful this 
  massage chains are."
115,Phoebe," 'Cause it's good money! But that doesn't change the fact that 
  this is an evil blood sucking corporate machine!"
117,Phoebe," (watching around and whispering) Ok, are they listening?"
120,Joey, Ross!
121,Ross, Hi!
122,Joey, I need to talk to you about Charlie.
123,Ross," (annoyed) Oh, do you, do you really?"
124,Joey," Yeah, I'm... I'm kind of having a little problem."
125,Ross," Look, if you don't know what the word ""acrimonious"" 
  means, just don't use it!"
126,Joey," No, look, you know Charlie, right? She's cool, she's funny, her 
  body is soo..."
127,Ross, Get to the problem!
128,Joey," Yes. It's just that she's so much smarter than all the girls I've 
  ever dated! Combined! I don't want her to think I'm stupid!"
129,Ross, (looking down) Are you wearing two belts?
130,Joey," (checking) EH, what do you know!"
131,Ross, You were saying you didn't want to seem stupid.
132,Joey," Right, right, right, well, she wants to go to all this cultural 
  places and I don't know how to talk about that stuff. You gotta help me out!"
133,Ross," You know, I really don't want to 
  get involved in you guy's relationship."
134,Joey," Please, c'mon, you're the smartest person I know and I really 
  like this girl, ok, I don't wanna lose her."
135,Ross, (after a short hesitation) Fine.
136,Joey, Thanks.
137,Ross," Ok. Let's see. Oh, you should take her to the MET!"
138,Joey, The Metsss!
139,Ross," Oh, no! The MET! The Metropolitan Museum of Art."
140,Joey," (realizing) Oh, that's what she meant! (pause) You know, if they're 
  gonna shorten it, they should call it the MUSE! You know, short for museum, 
  and avoid all the confusion!"
141,Ross," Yeah, most of it it's a place  packed with confused angry 
  baseball fans!"
142,Joey," Ok, all right, so I'll take her to the MET."
143,Ross," Yeah, uh, uh, ok, there's this great rare bookstore 
  on Madison Avenue. You know what? She loves architecture, 
  you know what you should do? You should take a walk down fifth to the 
  Saint Patrick's Cathedral and there there's this great little pastry shop that 
  she'd love."
144,Joey," Geez, sounds like you should be going on this date!"
145,Ross," But I'm not! (pause). You know what if you're in the mood for 
  Thai food..."
146,Joey," Whoa, whoa, whoa! Slow down, you go way too 
  fast. Ok? Just go back to the MET, ok?"
147,Ross, Ok.
148,Joey, You got to tell me exactly what to do there.
149,Ross," Ok, when you walk in the museum, take the right, that's the antiquities 
  wing. Ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, up to the Byzantine Empire."
150,Joey," Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! So, I walk in the door and make 
  the right (and he bends his arm to the left. Ross then bends Joey's arm to the 
  right and Joey nods)"
152,Chandler," I have a weird feeling about this place. (pause) How do I 
  know that they are not gonna secretly videotape me and put it all over the internet."
153,Monica," Because, honey, I mean this in the sweetest way possible, nobody 
  is gonna wanna watch that."
156,Chandler," Deposit my specimen? You know, 
  usually I have to call a  900 number for that kind 
  of talk. Thanks, got it."
157,Monica," Hey, honey, my test is down the hall, are you sure you're going 
  to be ok?"
158,Chandler," Yeah, I guess!"
159,Monica," I know this is embarrassing, but nobody cares! No one here even 
  knows you!"
161,Chandler," Oh, Come on!"
164,Monica," Hey, we're probably fertile, let's go home!"
165,Chandler, Why are you here?
167,Chandler," (to Heaven) No no no... I mean, why? why is 
  she here??"
169,Chandler, What!?
171,Monica," This was fun! But I've got an invasive vaginal exam to get to! 
  (leaves)"
172,Chandler," I'd love to stay, but I have eh... (points at the cup) got 
  a hot date... (starts to leave)"
174,Chandler, (disgusted) I think it just fell off. (Leaves)
176,Phoebe," (In a strange heavy accent) Hello ""ja"", it's time 
  for your massage, ja! Put your face in the hole."
177,Rachel," Wow, a Swedish massage from a real Swedish person. (Puts her 
  head in the hole and Phoebe enters)"
178,Phoebe," Okay, then I'm Swedish..."
179,Monica," So, what's your name?"
180,Phoebe, It's a normal Swedish name... Ikea...
181,Rachel, Oh... what an interesting name.
182,Phoebe, Ja!
183,Rachel," You know I... (lifts her head and tries to look in Phoebe's 
  direction)"
184,Phoebe, (pushes her head back down) Time for your scalp massage!
185,Rachel," (Sees Phoebe's slippers through the hole) Wow... I really love 
  your... (startled as she realizes those are Phoebe's slippers)"
186,Phoebe, Is something wrong?
187,Rachel," No, it's just that uhm... it feels so good... Ikea... (pause) 
  Yeah, say hey, you'll know this, what's the capital of Sweden?"
188,Phoebe, (Thinks for a few moments) Uhm... Stockholm.
189,Rachel, Damn! I wish I knew if that was right!
191,Joey," (gesturing at an imaginary painting) Note the painterly 
  lines and subtle impasto on this canvas. Monet painted quickly and usually outdoors 
  as his elusive subject was light itself."
192,Ross," Now, do you have any idea what you just said?"
193,Joey," (shaking his head as if to say of course not!) No, no, my mouth 
  says the words, my brain is thinking monster trucks!"
194,Ross," Ok now, remember, when you get to the museum, Monet is not spelt 
  M-O-N-A-Y. I just... I wrote that out phonetically for you."
195,Joey, Phonetically? (Looks confused)
196,Ross," Yeah, yeah that means... you know? We just... we don't have time 
  for this."
197,Joey, Ok.
198,Ross," Ok, but you know what? I gotta say, 
  I'm really impressed that you were able to memorize all this so quickly!"
199,Joey," Ah! I'm an actor! I can memorize anything! Last week on ""Days"" 
  I had to say ""Frontal temporal zygomatic craniotomy""."
200,Ross, Wow. What does that mean?
201,Joey," No idea! But the guy I said it to dies in the next scene so I 
  guess it means ""you're gonna get eaten by a bear""."
202,Ross, Ok! So let's move on to the Renaissance?
203,Joey," Ok, Caravaggio uses chiaroscuro here to highlight the anguish 
  of the central figure. Touch it, it's really bumpy! (Reaches out to touch the 
  imaginary painting)."
204,Ross," Nah ah! Nah ah! (stops him form doing so) No no no! No ad-libbing 
  and dude, you can't touch the paintings."
205,Joey, Come on! you... (reaches out to touch the imaginary painting again)
206,Ross, No! (Slaps his hand)
208,Chandler," (To the nurse at the nurses' station) My specimen is in the 
  room and I just want to thank whoever knocked on the door while I was in there. 
  Really helped speed the process along! (walks towards the common area and sees 
  Janice is still there) Janice! You're not... gone?"
210,Chandler, Yeah! yeah... The hard part is over!
212,Chandler," I haven't... I haven't even thought about the results yet... 
  I just assumed that everything was gonna be ok."
214,Chandler," (Slightly panicky) Yeah, but what if it's not? What if there 
  is a reason why we can't have a baby?"
216,Chandler," (smiling again) oh, oh, yeah, ok, thanks. I can't believe 
  I didn't even think of that. I guess I was just so worried about having to... 
  come here and do... 'that'..."
218,Chandler," (stares at her intently, then yells) It was a ""Wendy's!! 
  """
220,Phoebe," (Singing) ""Ipan Stripan, Glupi Glabi! "" And that is 
  the Swedish National Anthem! Thank you for asking! (looks annoyed)"
221,Rachel," Wow, Ikea... what a rich culture. Uhm, you know what? I have 
  a friend who is a masseuse."
222,Phoebe," Oh, Ja! Ja!"
223,Rachel, Yah! She's... uhm... not very good though... (Phoebe looks devastated)
224,Phoebe," Uhu, uhu... and why do you think that is?"
225,Rachel," I don't know... maybe it's because she has got such callousy 
  fingers from playing crummy guitar..."
226,Phoebe," Or... maybe she has trouble loosening your knots because you're 
  such a high maintenance tight ass!"
227,Rachel, (now lifts her head) Phoebe!!
228,Phoebe, You know it's me?
229,Rachel," For like a half an hour! Man, you can lie about Sweden!"
230,Phoebe, How can you come here?
231,Rachel, How could you not tell me you worked here?
232,Phoebe, I don't have to tell you everything!
233,Rachel," Yes you do, if you're going to make me feel guilty for getting 
  a free massage!"
234,Phoebe, Tips not included.
235,Rachel," Oh! Phoebe, why did you lie to me about working here?"
236,Phoebe," Because I was ashamed ok? I sold out for the cash! And then 
  they give me benefits like medical, and dental, and a 401K. But you know... 
  you pay a price. Now I'm this Corporate stooge and punching a clock and Ugh! 
  paying taxes!"
237,Rachel," Phoebe, honey, if you hate it so much, you should walk out there 
  right now and quit! Be true to what you believe in! Honey, you have principles 
  and I so admire that! I don't have any!"
238,Phoebe," You know what? You are right. I am gonna quit. It's time 
  I took my life back!"
239,Rachel, Good for you Pheebs!
240,Phoebe, Ok.
241,Phoebe," Okay (walks out and closes the door behind her, looks up and 
  whispers) If you guys have microphones in there too, I didn't mean any 
  of that. I love you."
243,Ross," Haha! Got ya! Die, die, die!"
245,Ross," (recovers his composure and starts typing) Respectfully, professor 
  R. Geller. (hits <return>, closes the laptop and joins Charlie on the 
  sofa) Hey!"
247,Ross," Hey, how was the Met?"
249,Ross," Yeah? Joey really knows his art, huh?"
251,Ross, What do you mean?
253,Ross," (perplexed for a moment) Wait a minute... when you guys walked 
  into the Met, did you go to the right?"
255,Ross," (shaking head) Oh Joey, Joey! But still, I mean, it seems like 
  you guys are having a great time together."
257,Ross, What?
259,Ross," What, I mean, a little, but no, what, go on."
261,Ross," (slowly) Yeah. But you know what? I think you should give Joey 
  a chance. I mean, he's a great guy, and sure he doesn't know that much about 
  art but you know, you can always talk about that with someone else."
263,Ross," And if you think about it, I mean the reason he memorized all 
  that stuff is because he thought it was important to you. You 
  know, that's the kind of guy Joey is."
265,Ross, That was going to be my next argument.
267,Joey, Hey!
268,Ross, Hey!
270,Joey, (to Charlie) You're ready?
272,Joey," (aside, to Ross) Hey Ross! That art stuff worked, you hooked me 
  up."
273,Ross, Glad I could help man.
274,Joey," Although some of that stuff wasn't where you said it was gonna 
  be, but... (confidently) I made it work."
276,Chandler," (picking up a plastic cup similar to the one he deposited 
  his specimen in) It is not okay that I'm aroused by this now."
278,Chandler," Hello? Oh hi, Doctor Connelly. (pause) No, she's not here 
  but, you know, I can tell her. Should I be sitting down for this? (his smile 
  fades as he hears the answer) Oh. (pause) Well, so what does that mean? (pause) 
  Ok. Ok, thank you. Thanks. (hangs up)"
280,Monica, Hey sweetie.
281,Chandler, Doctor Connelly just called.
282,Monica," With good news? (very quickly and wringing hands) Of course 
  it is not good news, you just said (deadpan) ""Doctor Connelly just called"". 
  If it was good news you would have said (excitedly) ""Doctor Connelly just 
  called! "" But so what is it? Is there a problem, uh? Is there a problem 
  with me or with you?"
283,Chandler, Actually it's both of us.
284,Monica, What?
285,Chandler," Apparently my sperm have low motility and you have an inhospitable 
  environment."
286,Monica, Oh... what does that mean?
287,Chandler," It means that my guys won't get off their barcaloungers 
  and you have a uterus that is prepared to kill the ones that do. (pause) It 
  means..."
288,Monica, Chandler?
289,Chandler," (seriously) It means that we can keep trying, but there's 
  a good chance this may never happen for us."
290,Monica, (weeping) Oh my God!
291,Chandler, I'm sorry.
292,Monica, I'm sorry too.
294,Chandler," Well, we're gonna... we're gonna figure this out."
295,Monica, (still weeping) I know.
299,Phoebe, (imitating the receptionist's tone) Good morning receptionist.
301,Phoebe," Rachel Green? (angrily) Son of a bitch, she came back?"
303,Phoebe," (through the door, with a Scottish accent) Are you ready for 
  your Scottish massage? Put your face in the hole, lassy."
1,Rachel," (speaking to herself and reading Cosmopolitan) Oh, lucky me! Coffee and a live sex show!"
3,Rachel," Oh... Oh, I'm sorry! I'm not... I was just-I was just reading to Emma."
5,Rachel," Yeah, yeah... It's... ""climax your way to better skin""."
7,Joey," So you need someone who knows fashion, to tell you what looks good."
8,Rachel," (hiding herself behind the magazine and whispering) Not me, not me, not me, not me, not me!"
9,Joey, Oh hey Rach!
10,Rachel, Yeah...
11,Joey, Maybe you could take Charlie shopping.
12,Rachel," Oh, well..."
14,Joey," Are you kidding? Rachel loves to shop! And she has great taste! Yeah, she's the one who taught me, you don't wear white after labour day and that you always, always, always have to put on underwear when you're trying on clothes."
16,Rachel," Ok, uh-uh... Let's-Let's shop!!"
17,Joey," (to Charlie) Ok, you're gonna come back with some very classy clothes... (aside to Rachel)... and some slutty lingerie, SLUTTY!"
18,Phoebe," (entering and talking on mobile phone) Ok, great! All right, bye! (she hangs up) Pain in the ass!! (she looks at the others, then back at the phone) That's off, right?"
19,Joey," What's the matter, Pheebs?"
20,Phoebe," Oh... Mike's sister just invited me to a party tonight, he's gonna be there. And she was like ""Oh, don't worry! I asked him. He's totally ok with seeing you!"". So now I have to go so he'll think that I'm totally ok with seeing him!"
21,Rachel," Which you're not, because you've totally hung up on him!"
22,Phoebe, Exactly!
23,Rachel, And you're gonna want him to eat his heart out so you're gonna have to look fabulous!
24,Phoebe," (after a short pause) I didn't even think about that! (pause) Aaargh, sexual politics!!"
25,Rachel," Hey Pheebs, I'm-I'm taking Charlie shopping, why don't you come and I'll help you find something."
26,Phoebe," Ok, that'll be great!"
27,Joey," Oh, ain't that nice? The three of you trying on slutty lingerie together."
28,Rachel, That's not what we're gonna do!
29,Joey," Why would you ruin it, who was that hurtin'?"
32,Chandler, (looking at the picture of the female reproductive system) Wow! Fortunately she has a very pretty face!
33,Monica," Oh, I so can't believe this! My uterus is an inhospitable environment? I was trying so hard to be a good hostess!"
34,Chandler," Oh, I can't believe my sperm have low motility because, let me tell you, when I was growing up they sure seem to be in a hurry to get places!!"
36,Chandler, Hi.
37,Monica, Hi.
39,Monica, Ok.
41,Chandler," Oh, DAMN IT!"
43,Monica," Don't worry, after a while he'll tune it out."
45,Monica, (long pause) Ok.
47,Chandler," Is that a hint? Because we love you Doctor Connelly but we don't think we'd want you to be our child! (Dr. Connelly glares at him) Wow, talking about an inhospitable environment!"
49,Rachel," Hi! Ok, you're ready to go pick up Phoebe and go shopping?"
51,Joey," (to Charlie) Alright, have a good time. (they kiss)"
52,Rachel, Not gonna find any clothes in there!
53,Ross," (entering) Hey, you guys!"
54,Rachel, Hi.
55,Ross, Guess who's up for keynote speaker at the National Paleontology Conference?
57,Ross," Yeah, right! What was last time he met a submission deadline for an abstract (he and Charlie laugh, then Joey starts laughing too without any reason) Well, why are you laughing?"
58,Joey," Just... seeing what it'd be like to be a paleontologist... it's fun, yeah!"
60,Ross," Professor Sherman, yeah. I've a meeting with him today."
62,Ross," Yeah, well... I think I know how to dazzle him."
63,Rachel," Oh... you're not gonna do a magic trick, are ya?"
64,Ross," Tsz... NO! (he goes to sit down, dropping a multicoloured silk streamer off his sleeve)."
65,Chandler, (entering) Hey guys!
66,Ross," Wait a minute, you guys. Oh, I wanna ask you something. I-I I may get to speak at this paleontology convention and if I do, I'd love for you guys to come and hear me."
67,Chandler," I think I can safely say that we all have family issues, work stuff and/or are sick."
68,Ross, It's in Barbados.
69,Chandler, But you come first!
70,Rachel, I'm there!
72,Joey, Bye.
73,Rachel," Bye, see ya. (she goes)"
74,Chandler, (sitting down on the couch) Ok.
75,Joey," All right, so. How did it go at the fertility clinic?"
76,Chandler, Not as much fun as last time. Apparently you only get porn if you're giving a sperm sample.
77,Ross, So-so what did the doctor say?
78,Chandler," Well... there's surrogacy, but Monica has dreamt her whole life of carrying a child, she has felt that watching a surrogate would be... too hard for her."
79,Joey, So you're ruling out surrogacy?
80,Chandler, Yeah.
81,Joey," So, I don't have to learn what that means?"
82,Chandler," Aside from adoption the only other choice is insemination, so... we're talking about sperm donors."
83,Joey," Enough said, I'm there for you man. Where is she, upstairs?"
84,Chandler, (stopping Joey) ah-ha!
85,Ross, How do you feel about all this?
86,Chandler, I wish there was an easier way for us to have a child but I don't think there is one.
87,Joey," Come on Ross, be a good guy. Step up and do it!"
88,Ross, (puzzled) What?
90,Ross, (looking astonished) What? NO! I am not going to give them Ben!
92,Ross, The data we are receiving from MRI scans and DNA testing of these fossils are - are staggering.
94,Ross," (reading from a notepad) I mean, we've been accepting Leakey's dates as a given, but if they're off by even a hundred thousand years or so then you can - you can just throw most of our assumptions, you know, right in the trash. (he throws the notepad in the waste bin) So-so what I am saying is - is is that (he picks the notepad back from the waste bin) is that the repercussions could be huge! I mean, not just in palaeontology, but if-if you think about it, in evolutionary biology, uh, genetics, geology, uh, I mean, truly the mind boggles!"
96,Ross," Oh, that's not what you want..."
99,Phoebe," Oh, I'll take some of that."
100,Rachel," Pheebs, that's for men!"
101,Phoebe," No, I know, this way when I go to the party later Mike will know I am over him cause I'm gonna smell like another guy. (to the shop assistant) Yeah."
103,Phoebe," Ok. Oh good, I'm dating a Russian cab driver. (to the shop assistant). Seriously does anyone buy this? I smell like beets!"
105,Rachel," On Melanie Griffith in ""Working girl"". I think what you want is over here."
107,Rachel, Really?
109,Rachel," Oh, I can't. Because I-I've seen them."
111,Rachel," Yeah! I'm a big fan! Of the movies, you know. Motion pictures. The Talkies!"
112,Phoebe," (picks up a dress) Hey Rach, will you come with me to a dressing room?"
113,Rachel, Sure!
114,Phoebe, Ok!
116,Rachel, You know that depends on what it is! I've done a lot of stuff.
118,Phoebe," So what were you doing out there, do you not like Charlie?"
119,Rachel," She's ok, I just don't get a really good vibe from her!"
120,Phoebe, Why?
121,Rachel," I don't know, you know, just the way she waltzed in here all smart, and tall! You know, and just swept Joey off his feet... I mean, nobody else has a chance!"
122,Phoebe, Who else?
123,Rachel," Anybody! You, me, you know, Monica's mom..."
124,Phoebe, You like Joey?
125,Rachel," Shhhhh! Phoebe! All right, look. I have a little thing for him."
126,Phoebe, (whispering) Oh my God!
127,Rachel," It's just physical and I have it totally under control! Ok? It's just, when I see them together, sometimes I just get a little jealous!"
128,Phoebe," Uh, wow! Isn't it ironic that he liked you and now you like him?"
129,Rachel," (annoyed) Oh, I get it!"
130,Phoebe," Oh well, as long as it is under control, you know, you can't do anything about it, he's already dating her, and she is a nice person, that wouldn't be right."
131,Rachel," I know, I know, so it is just not a big deal."
132,Phoebe, Yeah.
133,Rachel, So can we keep this between us?
134,Phoebe, Sure!
135,Rachel," Ok, great, because I gotta get out of here, the smell of beets is killing me!"
136,Phoebe, Oh.
138,Phoebe, Any chance Charlie has a deaf twin?
140,Monica, Hi honey!
141,Chandler," Hey! Look I brought a friend for dinner, this is Zack, from work!"
142,Monica," Oh, of course, it's so nice to see you again, Zack!"
144,Chandler," You guys haven't actually met before, but, boy! You're both polite! (pause) Go to have a seat Zack, and I'll get you a beer."
145,Monica, I got it.
147,Chandler," (to Mon) So, Zack's pretty nice, uh?"
148,Monica," Yeah, I guess."
149,Chandler," So, how would you like to have a baby that's half yours and half his!"
150,Monica, (turns around and she's quite shocked) Excuse me?
151,Chandler," Well, we're talking about sperm donors and Zack may be the guy! I mean, look, he's intelligent, he's healthy, he's athletic, I mean, he is ""spermtastic""!"
152,Monica," Chandler, this is crazy! What did you even say to him! ""Come up, meet my wife! Give us your sperm""!"
153,Chandler," No, I invited him to dinner so you could get a chance to get to know him! I mean, if we go through a sperm bank you never meet the guy, get to check him out."
154,Monica, Chandler!
155,Chandler," I'm telling you, he's great! I mean, even if my sperm worked fine, I'd think he'd be the way to go!"
156,Monica, I'm not going to be a part of this! You can't just bring some random guy at home and expect him to be our sperm donor!
157,Chandler, Ok!
158,Monica, Uh!
159,Chandler, (bringing the beer to Zack) Zack!
162,Monica," Tell me about yourself, Zack!"
164,Rachel," Oh, God, do you think she heard? It would be so bad if she heard!"
165,Phoebe," Well, maybe she didn't hear! Ok I'm gonna go into that dressing room, you stay in here and I'll talk and see if you can hear me."
166,Rachel," Ok, great!"
168,Rachel," Oh, thank God I can't hear a word that you're saying!"
169,Phoebe, (sticks her head out) I didn't say anything yet!
170,Rachel," (sticks her head out too) Well, get back in there and talk!"
171,Phoebe, (goes back in) I'm Rachel. It's so annoying when I put Emma on the phone to talk with my friends.
172,Rachel, (comes out again) What!?
173,Phoebe," (comes out too) Well, some things are just hard to say to your face."
174,Rachel," Ok well, I heard that! Which means that she heard it too!"
175,Phoebe, Ooh! We have a problem.
176,Rachel, Oh! What are we gonna do?
179,Rachel, Oh my God!
181,Rachel, (yelling at the stranger) Alright! Enough out of you!
183,Joey, Hello?
184,Ross," Joey! Hey, I need to talk to Charlie. Is she there?"
185,Joey, No. no... eh... she went shopping with Rachel. Why? What's up?
186,Ross, I'm meeting with professor Sherman about my being the keynote speaker...
187,Joey, Oh! How's it going?
188,Ross," It could be better! He, uhm... he fell asleep!"
189,Joey, What!? But I already bought my ticket to Bermuda!
190,Ross, Barbados.
191,Joey," Fine, I'll rent a car and drive...! Ross, you have to get that job!"
192,Ross, What am I supposed to do? He's out cold! In fact he was just talking in his sleep before and evidently he wants someone named Fran to spank him harder.
193,Joey," Well, just wake him up!"
194,Ross," I can't! If he realizes that I'm the one that put him to sleep, I won't get the job!"
195,Joey," Uh! That's a tough one. Oh! Wait a minute, this happened to me before! Yeah, I was auditioning for a play and the producer fell asleep and... (pause) no wait a minute... it was me who fell asleep... Yeah I mean hey, Shakespeare, how about a chase scene once in a while!?"
197,Monica, Hey guys! Dinner's ready!
199,Chandler," So what do you think? I want that guys genes for my kid! Those eyes, those cheeckbones!"
200,Monica," Ok, there's enthusiastic and there's just plain gay!!"
201,Chandler, You don't like him.
202,Monica, I think he is fine! It's just that we don't know anything real about him... we should get more information.
203,Chandler, Alright! Just follow my lead!
206,Chandler," Oh! Thanks, I'm crazy about our place. Hey! speaking of crazy... do you have a history of mental illness in the family?"
208,Chandler, (very seriously) That's really not the kind of thing we are looking for Zack.
210,Monica," Oh, friends first, drunk in London, you know the story. I've got a better question for you Do you or any of your blood relatives have diabetes?"
212,Monica," Eh... Heart Disease, Alzheimers, gout?"
214,Monica, We're just making conversation. (Chandler makes an agreeing-sound)
216,Chandler," You know what's not funny? Male Pattern Baldness (Monica stretches her neck to look behind Zack's head and then gives Chandler an ""ok"" sign)"
220,Chandler, I noticed you were enjoying that Ravioli with a beautiful set of teeth. Did you have braces as a child?
222,Monica, Yess!! (M & C high-five and Zack looks confused again)
223,Chandler, (Proceeding with his dinner) We're teeth people Zack!
225,Rachel, Alright! Let's just do it. Let's just go over there and see if she heard.
226,Phoebe, Good plan.
227,Rachel, Ok. (Phoebe starts to walk in the opposite direction though. Rachel sees and follows her) Wha...? where? Where are you going?
228,Phoebe," Oh! I'm sorry Rachel, I don't have time for your childish games, ok? I still have to go find something incredible to wear so I can beat Mike at ""who's more over who""! (at which she walks away)"
229,Rachel," (to Charlie) Hey, hi! Hey, where've you been?"
231,Rachel," (pretends to be stunned) Oh! Wi... in the dres... in the dressing room!? Well, that's so weird! Phoebe and I were just trying on clothes in the dressing room. God it's just such a small world!"
233,Rachel," Oh God. You did. You heard. Ok, listen, let me explain."
235,Rachel, (after a pause) Yeah.
237,Rachel," Yeah! That's Phoebe. That's Phoebe. You know, she just wants them all! It's like she's a nympho!"
239,Rachel, Yeah...
241,Rachel, (Looks ashamed) I try...
244,Ross, (To the still half asleep Professor) Oh my God! You really want me to be the keynote speaker? Thank you! (hugs him whilst still on his lap)
248,Joey, (impressed) Wow! You look... (drops the cookie)... stop-eating hot! Which is like the highest level of hotness!
249,Phoebe, Are you sure? Because I'm really dreading going to this party.
250,Joey, Then don't go!
251,Phoebe," Mike knows I'm coming, and if I don't show up he'll think it's because of him! And I don't want to lose face! That's a very serious thing in my culture."
252,Joey," Alright, then you go to that party and you pretend to be over Mike. And afterward you come to my place and I'll get you good and drunk!"
253,Phoebe," You got it! Ok. But not on the wine that you made, ok, because I just don't want to go back to the Emergency Room."
256,Phoebe, David?
259,Phoebe, Oh my God! (they hug)
261,Phoebe, Yeah. What-what are you doing here?
263,Phoebe, What happened?
265,Phoebe, Yeah?
267,Phoebe," Well, it's great that you're back! How are you?"
269,Phoebe, Good!
271,Phoebe," (disappointed) Oh, good for you."
273,Phoebe, Mike and I broke up.
275,Phoebe, Really?
277,Phoebe," I understand. Yeah. Ok so then ok, so we're both living in New York, not seeing anyone. That's so not like us!"
279,Phoebe, Well... (pause) no.
281,Phoebe, I'd love to.
283,Phoebe, Ok. (they walk away together)
285,Phoebe," Oh, got it, stay upwind of me."
288,Rachel," No, that's David."
290,Rachel, (disapprovingly) Tip of the iceberg.
293,Chandler, You sure you don't wanna stick around a little longer?
295,Chandler," Are you just tired now or are you always tired, 'cause that could be a sign of clinical depression."
297,Chandler, Ok.
299,Chandler, I think we've found our sperm!
300,Monica, Does seem pretty perfect.
301,Chandler," Yeah, you think so, well? Should I ask him?"
302,Monica, (pause) No.
303,Chandler," Why not, just because his great-grandmother was obese, our kids are gonna get that from you anyway!"
304,Monica," No, that's not it. It's just that when we were asking him all those questions before, I just... I just realized I don't care if he's the most perfect guy in the world... he's not you."
305,Chandler," Yeah, he's better!"
306,Monica," No, he's not. And if I can't get pregnant with you, then I don't want to get pregnant by... him or anyone else."
307,Chandler, Really? Are you sure?
308,Monica," Yeah, I'm sure."
309,Chandler," (sighs with relief) Thank God, because I don't wanna do this either. You know, I was just doing because I thought that was what you wanted to do. You know, I'm the husband, I'm supposed to... bring the sperm."
310,Monica, That is so sweet. I love you. (they kiss)
311,Chandler, So you know this leaves us with...
312,Monica, Adoption.
313,Chandler, How do you feel about that?
314,Monica, I think I feel ok about it. Actually I think I feel really good about it.
315,Chandler, Me too. I wanna find a baby that needs a home and I wanna raise it with you. And I wanna mess it up in our own specific way.
316,Monica," So this is it, we're really gonna adopt?"
317,Chandler, (smiling) Yeah.
318,Monica," (excitedly) Oh my God, we're gonna be parents!"
319,Chandler, We are gonna be great parents.
320,Monica," And it could be soon. I mean, think about it right now, somewhere out there (they go look through the window) our baby could be being conceived."
321,Chandler," Wait, if we're lucky, and we're really really really quiet, we may be able to hear the sound of a condom breaking!"
325,Chandler," Hey, Zack!"
327,Chandler," Look, I just wanted to apologize for last night. I got the feeling we made you a little uncomfortable."
329,Chandler, Really?
331,Chandler," My wife and I have some boundary issues, you know, sometimes we ask inappropriate questions. We're working on it."
336,Chandler," You wouldn't know if Jeanette's planning on keeping her baby, would ya?"
